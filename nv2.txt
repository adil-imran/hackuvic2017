A theme park dubbed 'the UK Disneyland' is set to open in five years according to those behind the plans.

It's due to be the first of its kind in the UK and is set to feature more than 50 rides and attractions, as well as 2,000-seat theatre.

The Paramount theme park, due to be based in Dartford, Kent, will feature rides based around the films the company has produced.

Paramount is behind  films such as Titanic, the Transformers series, Iron Man and Forrest Gump

It will also feature rides from BBC Worldwide shows, along with Aardman Animations, so there could be Doctor Who-themed rollercoasters.

The park will contain zones such as Adventure Isle, Land of Legends, Cartoon Circus, Starfleet Command, Action Square, Port Paramount and Entertainment City.

According to Essex Live, the plans for the park will be approved when a development consent order (DCO) is submitted to the government in November.

Access to the park won't be cheap; a full-priced day ticket is expected to cost Â£57.

Humphrey Percy , group CEO of the project's parent company Kuwaiti European Holdings, said he is confident that plans will be approved and affordable.

"We have the financial backing to take us all the way through that process," he added.

If approved by the government, building will start in 2019.
