Venus has been a beacon in the western sky since the beginning of the year. But now Venus is leaving us behind. As the second planet, its proximity to the sun makes it move faster in its orbit (its year is only 225 days compared to Earth's 365-day year).

Every day Venus is sinking a little farther in the western sky. So, if you want to catch it before it disappears, look for it this week by facing west between 6:30 and 7 p.m. (7:30 and 8 p.m. Daylight Time) for the best view.

If you look through a telescope, you should be able to see that Venus currently appears as a crescent. The planet goes through phases from our point of view as it orbits around the sun. Galileo was the first to observe this with a telescope and it was key evidence that the sun, not the Earth, is the center of our solar system.
