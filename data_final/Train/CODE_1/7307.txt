Council for Interreligious Freedom reaffirms commitment against terrorism

Christian and Muslim leaders in Pakistan came together to pray for peace and to reaffirm their common commitment against terrorism, in the aftermath of the Easter massacre in Lahore.

The prayer service, which took place in St. Mary Church in Lahore, was organized by the Council for Interreligious Freedom, reported the Vatican news agency, Fides.

Father Francis Nadeem, provincial of the Capuchins in Pakistan and the founder of the council, said the service provided "significant proof of national harmony and common interreligious commitment to peace, justice and solidarity."

Pir Shafaat Rasool, a Muslim member of the council condemned "the merciless act" in Lahore, "which is contrary to the teachings of Islam."

Other speakers called on Pakistanâ€™s government to be vigilant with sponsors of terrorist organizations.

Participants lit candles to remember the dead, offering prayers for their souls, and expressed solidarity with the families of all the victims.
