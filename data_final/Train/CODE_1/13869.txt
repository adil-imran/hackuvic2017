Many Westerners are living under Sharia law but are totally oblivious because 99% of Westerners have no understanding of what the Shariah is.

The creator of the burkini, Australian-Lebanese designer Aheda Zanetti, said the burkini was designed to give women more freedom. However, these freedoms are taken away from women through oppressive garments such as the burkini. We saw the same thing with hijabs. Hijabs were once an option and now the only Muslim women represented in the media are hijabis. In other words, what Muslim women are being told – and shamed with – is that if you’re not covered, you’re not Muslim or modest. It’s a soft form of slut-shaming that surprisingly few feminists have caught onto. One day it’s hijabistas and the next day it’s burkinis, but the message is the same: cover up.

The burkini is a new adaptation of that. Though unintended by the designer, the consequences are the same: if you’re not covered, you’re inappropriate. And that’s what the underbelly of Islamic culture does: it aims to control a woman’s space, whether it is in the mosque, in the bedroom, in the home, her body, or her voice. It’s an abusive cultural conditioning.

There is nothing like Sharia in Western culture. Sharia comes from 3 sources, the Koran, Sira, Hadith, and codifies all the info into a manual for an Islamic civilization. It guides Muslims on how to lead life. Every aspect of life finds a place in the Sharia, including how to say hello, how to have sex, disciplining a wife, jihad, punishing a child, going to the toilet, etc. Most importantly it affects the non-Muslim. It is a totalitarian, supremacist ideology. -Bill Warner, Phd
