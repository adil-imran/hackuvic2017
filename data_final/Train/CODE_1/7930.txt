A judicial judge in El Salvador has ordered prosecutors to reopen a probe in to one of the infamous massacres in current historical past: the military’s slaying of tons of of individuals within the village of El Mozote.

Human rights advocate Ovidio Mauricio told The- Related Press on Sat. in that Judge Jorge Guzman Urquilla had accepted the request filed by his organization & two different groups. The- choice was based mostly on a Jul. ruling by the country’s Supreme Courtroom in that overturned a law granting amnesty for war crimes throughout El Salvador’s 1979-1992 civil war.

A postwar U.N. truth commission concluded in that the military massacred a minimum of 500 people in El Mozote & surrounding villages in three days in Dec. 1981. Victims’ rights advocates put the number nearer to 1,000. General, at the very least 75,000 people died within the little nation’s civil war.

The U.N. truth commission report put responsibility for the massacre on Col. Domingo Monterrosa, commander of the Atlacatl battalion, operations chief Col. Armando Azmitia and 6 different officers. Monterrosa & Azmitia died when a bomb went off of their helicopter in 1984.
