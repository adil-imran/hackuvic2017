In a meeting with the Head of Belgian Parliament's Foreign Relations Committee Derek Vander Molen, he added that alliance of certain countries with Al-Nusra terrorist group against Daesh is dangerous and will make Syrian and regional conditions more complicated.



Criticizing West's double-standard approach towards human rights, Larijani said while western states are ignoring the 70-year crimes by the Zionists in the occupied lands as well as merciless massacre of Yemenis by the Saudis, they accuse Iran of human rights violation under baseless excuses and this is unacceptable.



As to Iran-Belgium ties, the official said that Majlis supports expansion of bilateral ties in all fields, especially economy.



Enhancement of parliamentary ties plays a crucial role in boosting mutual cooperation, he said.



Belgian official, for his part, said that Belgian parliament like Iran believes that regional issues should be solved through diplomatic channels.



The 125-year-old relations between the two countries reveals both sides' interest to maintain ties, he said.



Belgian parliament and government is keen on promoting communications in political, economic, cultural and parliamentary spheres with Iran as a major and historic country in the region and world.



Belgian lawmakers are opposed to massacre of innocent people in Palestine, Yemen and other regional states as they believe in diplomatic channels for solving regional problems.



The two countries' consultation in regional issues is of high importance and will contribute to regional peace and stability, he said.
