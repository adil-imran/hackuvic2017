Backpackers staying at a hostel where one woman was fatally stabbed and another injured trying to save her barricaded themselves in their rooms during the frenzied attack.

Mia Ayliffe-Chung, 21, was killed and Tom Jackson, 30, was left fighting for his life after being stabbed in the face, head and torso during Frenchman Smail Ayad's alleged rampage in a Queensland backpacker's hostel.

This comes as it was revealed by Ms Ayliffe-Chung's mother that her daughter's ashes will travel the world so she can 'visit places' she now isn't able to.

Frenchman Smail Ayad has been charged with murder and a number of other offences

The owner of Shelley's Backpackers John Norris, said backpackers locked themselves in their rooms for over three hours during the stabbing.

'It started just after 11pm and probably went through until 2am, 2.30am,' Mr Norris told 9News.

'They were told to get into the room and lock themselves in there.'

The hostel owner also revealed that Ayad - who has been charged with murder, two counts of attempted murder, serious animal cruelty and 12 counts of assaulting police - was due to check out the morning after the attack.

'I want to say I am really sorry to Mia's and Tommy's family,' Mr Norris previously told Daily Mail Australia.

'I can't even imagine what they're going through.'

Ms Ayliffe-Chung's mother has revealed her daughter will be cremated and her ashes scattered around the world

''That way she can visit places she hasn’t visited yet' Rosie Ayliffe wrote in a blog

Hostel worker Grant Schulz was also injured in the attack.

This week Ms Ayliffe-Chung's mother wrote in a blog for The Independent that she had decided her daughter 'needed to be cremated sooner rather than later'.

'I know some of her friends are struggling with that, because they wanted her body brought home and a cremation or burial here in the Wirksworth area, but she has friends all over the place,' Rosie Ayliffe revealed.

'Hence the plan to create a place of remembrance here, but also to give various people vials of Mia’s ashes to scatter in places dear to her or to them.

'That way she can visit places she hasn’t visited yet. Canada, New Zealand, Singapore. People are making huge journeys to mourn her,' her mother wrote.
