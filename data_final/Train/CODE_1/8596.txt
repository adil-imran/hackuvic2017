Update, Jan. 17:

The father of Aylan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian Kurdish refugee who drowned off the coast of Turkey as his family fled violence, said he wept upon seeing the Charlie Hebdo cartoon portraying his late son as a monkey rapist.

“When I saw the picture, I cried,” Abdullah Kurdi told AFP. “My family is still in shock.”

He called the cartoon “inhuman and immoral.”

Original, Jan. 13:

French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo was attacked by Islamic extremists on Jan. 7, 2015. A dozen people were killed, leading to global expressions of “Je suis Charlie” — or “I am Charlie.”

At the time, critics accused the ostensible free speech campaign of hypocrisy, noting how repressive countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, Israel and others exploited the shootings for political gains, staging a photo op. They also pointed out that the media devoted exponentially less attention to the slaughter of 2,000 Nigerians by Boko Haram just days before.

Less than a week after the first anniversary of the attack, Charlie Hebdo reignited controversy by publishing a cartoon that characterizes dead refugee children fleeing violence in the Middle East as future monkey rapists.

Hebdo – 'What would little Aylan have grown up to be? Ass groper in Germany'. Don't be apalled you just don't get it pic.twitter.com/LIYJEYjydy — Nesrine Malik (@NesrineMalik) January 13, 2016

“What would little Aylan have grown up to be?” its latest cartoon asks, referring to Aylan Kurdi, a three-year-old Syrian Kurdish refugee whose dead body washed up on a Turkish beach.

An “ass groper in Germany,” it responds, referencing a series of sexual assaults on women in Cologne, Germany that were attributed to “Arab and North African men.”

The drawing depicts Middle Eastern refugees who fled brutal, Western-fueled wars in their respective countries as lascivious apes chasing a white European woman.

Condemnations of the cartoon flooded social media in response. Critics called it racist and reminiscent of colonialist and orientalist portrayals of people from the Middle East. Others even said it is downright fascist.

It’s textbook racist imagery (not new to Charlie Hebdo) where the foreign, brown/black man is a threat to the white European woman. — Sana Saeed (@SanaSaeed) January 13, 2016

You just don't get it. In order to understand just how non-racist #CharlieHebdo is, you have to be a French racist. — George Ciccariello (@ciccmaher) January 14, 2016

There is nothing, absolutely nothing ‘revolutionary’ about Charlie Hebdo’s latest cartoon, this is pure fascism. pic.twitter.com/cqGUMxuyWG — Mahmoud (@MahmoudRamsey) January 13, 2016
