War crimes suspect sentenced in Ohio for lying on documents

CLEVELAND (AP) â€” A Serbian refugee who admitted to lying on immigration documents about whether he ever engaged in genocide or ethnic cleansing has been sentenced in a U.S. court in Ohio to two years in prison.

Slobodan Mutic will be sent back to Croatia to face trial for alleged war crimes after serving his sentence in the United States, said Mike Tobin, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Cleveland. Interpol issued an arrest warrant for Mutic in 2002, Tobin said.

Mutic, 53, has been living in the Akron suburb of Barberton since 1999. Married with two children, he was employed at a foundry when federal agents interviewed him in 2012 about his past life in the war-torn region once known as Yugoslavia.

Authorities say Mutic admitted in an affidavit in 1992 that he and another man killed a Croatian couple while members of a Serbian militia group. Mutic also is a suspect in a third slaying in that region that isn't related to ethnic cleansing, Tobin said.

Mutic pleaded guilty in December to the federal charge of lying on immigration documents.

"Our nation welcomes refugees, but not human rights criminals," U.S. Attorney Steven Dettelbach said in a statement Wednesday. "This defendant lied his way into this nation and does not deserve the privileges and freedoms this great nation offers."
