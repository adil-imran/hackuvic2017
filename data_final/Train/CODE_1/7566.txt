PIKETON, Ohio (AP) – Goodbyes to the last of eight members of a rural Ohio family killed more than a week ago will soon take place.

Funerals for the remaining six victims will be held on Tuesday. The Rhoden family members were shot in the head at four different homes near Piketon on April 22.

Services were held Saturday for 20-year-old Hannah Gilley as authorities remain silent in what they say will be a lengthy investigation into the shootings.

Hundreds of family members and friends attended the young mother’s funeral in Otway, Ohio. Her baby was one of three children who survived the massacre.

Last Thursday in Kentucky, services were held for 38-year-old Gary Rhoden.

Scioto County Sheriff Marty Donini tells The Columbus Dispatch that the situation is “unheard of and overwhelming.”
