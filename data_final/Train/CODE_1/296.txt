One of the most damning statements of voter fraud was just dropped with an Internet video showing the Commissioner of Elections in New York City openly admitting there is abundant voter fraud.

Alan Schulkin tells a tale of people being bussed from voter poll to voter poll to take advantage of the fact they are not allowed to ask for voter id

This is a top ranking voting official in the state of New York telling the country he knows they are abusing the system, yet nothing is being done about it.

The thing is that unlike Mittens and Mclame, Trump is not a paid loser. He is a fighter and the slightest sniff of fraud and he will fight the result all the way. The Rats try anything and we will have Civil War

“...Trump is not a paid loser. He is a fighter...” .

Trump is allowed to bring a knife to the RAT gunfight. The fix is in.

Reporter, “Well, maybe you won’t vote for Hillary. I don’t know.” Schulkin, “I wouldn’t but I have no choice.” He’d be dead if he crossed party lines.

Personally, I don’t believe the pollsters have a clue anymore.

I think they’re making it up now out of whole cloth. Trump’s support is much higher than we’re constantly being told. The Dems know this too. I honestly suspect that we’re going to see comprehensive and aggressive voter fraud as the Dems panic knowing full well that for many of them, a stolen election is their only hope in hell of staying out of prison. The GOPe will, of course, fall to its knees and wrap its lips around the Dem propaganda spigot, as we’ve all grown to expect. There will be bloodshed.

This is probably how they got more votes for hilLIARy over Bernie, even though Bernie had the bigger and more enthusiastic crowds, in the primaries. The corrupt democrap party screwed Bernie Sanders and his supporters in more ways than one, when you also look at the leaked emails showing collusion between the media and the hilLIARy camp. CGato

Reminds me of California back in the mid 1800s. In one election men who were dead walked into the polls and demanded to be allowed to vote.

They were Indians who had been well versed in which name they would call themselves and who they would vote for.

Everyone got a laugh when one of the Indians claimed to be..”O’Mally!”

Wearing Red Shirts is a good idea. My OH crew is going to be Poll Watchers at various precincts in the county. You keep score as people come in and vote. Get a feel for how many an hour go thru. Check and record the counter on the optical scan ballot reader. That count as the day wears on should jive with your score card. If Poll Operator knows you have a clue, they don’t give you static.

Remember how a Bill Clinton regime functionary, Treasury Dept. official Joshua L. Steiner, testified under oath that he essentially lied to his diary when he made statements there that put the Clinton regime in a bad light? See http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/26/us/treasury-official-is-disavowing-whitewater-details-in-his-diary.html?pagewanted=all if you need a refresher. In this upside-down world, that's all that this guy has to do to redeem himself. He'll be welcomed back into the flock, and this story will likely go nowhere.

Problem is they outed this man and now his life is probably in danger.

nothing to see\hear here...just locker room talk



To: Beave Meister

I believe the rats will do their best to rig the election. But they are also skewing the polls with the hopes of some of us believing we’ve already lost, creating the belief: “So what’s the use in voting?” That that in mind, I also believe there are false stories out there and/or actual fraud taking place so blatantly they do get caught, because they want to. Why? News stories of the election being rigged will create the same effect: “So what’s the use in voting?” We’ve got to get the people to vote. The left (meaning the entire globalist/wall street/uniparty/RINO’s/demparty/GOPe) are in a pure panic mode and will stop at nothing to win. They will leave no stones unturned. If by some chance the landslide is enough to overcome this fraud, there will be civil disruption. If we think BLM and the muzzie terror is bad now, just wait.



To: Grimmy

“Trumps support is much higher than were constantly being told. The Dems know this too.” Of course they do. It’s why the entire media apparatus in this country has pulled out all the stops to bring him down. If he were truly no threat, and didn’t have a prayer of winning, they would be completely relaxed, and even a bit giddy, at this point in the race.
