It’s Bernie Sanders’s moment, which means that journalists are poring over his early years, including his travel overseas. Yossi Melman, a journalist, revealed yesterday the name of the kibbutz that Sanders famously worked on in the 1960s:

It was reported that B. Sandres refused to say in which kibbutz he stayed in 60's in Israel. In 1990 interview he told me Shaar Haamakim — Yossi Melman (@yossi_melman) February 4, 2016

The kibbutz is not far from Haifa in Northern Israel. Here’s its Hebrew website. It was run by the socialist movement, Hashomer Hatzair. Haaretz followed up with a story describing the kibbutz period as a “mystery” because the Sanders campaign has refused to tell reporters where he stayed.

However, on Thursday an article was found in the Haaretz archive from 1990, written by former intelligence correspondent and analyst Yossi Melman. Sanders… told Melman that in 1963 he spent a number of months in Kibbutz Sha’ar Ha’amakim, in northern Israel, as a guest of the Hashomer Hatzair youth movement.

In the interview, published under the title “The First Socialist” during his first campaign to the senate, Sanders said he grew up “in a Jewish environment in Brooklyn, New York, in which the Holocaust and Israel were always important.” The article says that after spending time on the kibbutz, he seems to have lost his connection to Israel, Zionism and Judaism, but fails to offer any further details, instead asking the then-hopeful senator why he chose to settle in Vermont. Sanders’ campaign refused to confirm the name of the kibbutz the senator had volunteered on. Now all that is left is to discover what happened during his time in the Galilee, after which he divorced his first wife. Did the Sanders’ stay on the kibbutz have anything to do with the divorce?
