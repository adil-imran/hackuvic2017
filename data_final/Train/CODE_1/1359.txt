The Return of The Mule (Short and to the point)

The Z Man ^ | October 10, 2016

Posted on by 2ndDivisionVet

If you go back and watch videos of Reagan in the 70s and 80s, one of the things that jumps out is how aggressively he attacked the Left. In his first inaugural address, he attacked the very essence of what Jimmy Carter stood for as a politician. The man was sitting just behind Reagan as the Gipper explained that everything Carter believed was dangerous nonsense. The other thing that jumps out, when watching old Reagan speeches, is that no Republican talks like that anymore.

Instead, every Republican that has aggressively pressed the attack against the Left over the last quarter century, has been attacked by the media and so-called conservatives as unacceptably polarizing as if that is a thing. Official Conservatism has instead insisted that they abide by a set of gentile rules designed by the ruling majority, intended to perpetuate their hegemony. You could be forgiven for thinking that maybe the whole thing was a setup, a game of bad cop  worse cop, in order to rig the results.

Whenever the futility of this arrangement has been pointed out to Official Conservatism, they sigh and concede that it is unfair, but principle demands we abide by the rules because thats who we are. If you pointed out that who they were was a bunch of losers, they would put on their lemon face and suggest that perhaps you were disloyal or some sort of hate thinker. Conservatism in America became the candy coating to the liberal nut inside the system.

I was thinking about that over the weekend as first we get the leaked tape of Donald Trump talking like a normal man, who believed he was in a private conversation with another man. The beta male pansies in the managerial class dont know anything about this, but normal men in private like to tell dick jokes, boast about women and reminiscence about their exploits. The faggots that take up space in Official Conservatism dont know about these things.

Watching one traitorous fink after another decry Trumps locker room talk from a decade ago, I was reminded once again that these people were never on my side. It was always a con, a grift, to fool otherwise decent people into putting down their weapons and surrendering to the Left. Buckley-style conservatism, whatever it was, is now just a tool of the managerial class to clear the field for nation-wrecking policies to benefit the ruling elite at the expense of the middle class.

Last night, I was reminded of why Trump was able to obliterate the GOP field despite being out spent a million-to-one. He is not a pussy. Any other Republican faced with the dirty trick pulled on Friday would have gone into the debate prepared to grovel and plead, begging for a second chance. It is not all all inconceivable that he would have offered to step aside. Trump went into the debate prepared to deliver a counter bunch designed to knock the old fat cow on her ass.

It was a sterling performance that turned the tactics and strategy of the government party back onto them. If the contest is going to be a referendum on Trumps character, then Trump is going to make a big show of exploring the character of the Clinton Gang. Having Bubbas many sexual assault victims at the event was a missile landing directly into the weapons cache of the Clinton campaign. His demand for a special prosecutor reminded everyone of the elephant in the room.

When even the most disloyal of craven rumpswabs concedes Trump won the debate, you know it was a great night for The Donald.

(TWEET-AT-LINK)

Guys like Jonah Goldberg would sooner take a job in the dreaded private sector than say anything nice about Trump or the people prepared to vote for him. As Ive pointed out in the past, Goldberg is Exhibit A for the case against Official Conservatism and the party it has infested. Trump stands as the rebuke of the surrender caucus, that has profited guys like Goldberg so handsomely over the last two decades. If he has to concede to Trump, you know it was a great win.

Trump probably will not win and even if he does, its probably too late to avoid disaster anyway. Democracies always murder themselves. That is the lesson of history and ours will do the same, sooner rather than later. If the worst is to be avoided, then the present arrangements must be de-legitimized in order for a reform effort to have room to grow. Thats the role of Trump in the election. He the destroyer of worlds that need destroying.

When this all started, I compared Trump to the character in the Asimov Foundation series called The Mule. One way of interpreting this character is as a destroyer that sweeps away that which must be swept away in order for something better to rise in its place. Thats the Trump campaign. By cracking the Conservative Industrial Complex and challenging the legitimacy of the managerial class, he is exposing the whole thing as a racket, one which the people can no longer trust.

Last night The Mule Returned.

The Republican Party as has existed for way too long is dead. It had become a diseased and corrupted and self-mutilated parody of a principled party. Its demise was coming sooner or later. On Sunday night Trump delivered the death blow.

Official Conservatism has instead insisted that they abide by a set of gentile rules designed by the ruling majority, intended to perpetuate their hegemony A point well taken. Another word for this "Official Conservatism" is political correctness. The problem is not only have we abandoned the definition of political correctness to the left but we have conflated universal notions of cultural decency with political correctness. Before we castigate Rinos for resorting to political correctness or "official conservatism" to cover their sins, and before we date the beginning and the end of the Republican Party with the blowup over Trump, we might consider that the true date, if one considers only recent history, is the date the Republican Party walked away from Ted Cruz who stood on his feet all night long filibustering for you and me. Unfortunately, Cruz was not abandoned by Rinos only, he was abandoned by the people who are now rationalizing the destruction of the Republican Party as an event to be welcomed and with it the possible demise of conservatism.

I like Reagan's and Trump's Big Tent, reach out to old school Democrats who have been neglected/sneered at by the Democrats, at the expense of some Unfettered Free Trade/Open Borders/NWO types with money who actively undermine the other Republicans on every other issue.



To: Dr. Sivana

And yes, I know Reagan’s defalt position was free trade, but he made exceptions as needed, never made it an idol, and was competing on comparatively level ground with Japan, because WE DIDN’T HAVE FREE TRADE WITH the CHICOMs, nor were we intending to pursue it in any serious way until Bush the Elder and WTO deals.



To: Dr. Sivana

I stopped calling myself a Republican after George W Bush put in place The Patriot Act and allowed rampant deficit spending.

I stopped calling myself a Conservative when so many “Conservative” (Beck, Cruz, Ryan, Will, Krauthammer, etc.) tried to make sure Hillary became president rather than Trump. I’m a nationalist. Trump is a Nationalist. I want to put America first. You want a big tent? Go find every American voter who wants to put America first. The federal government isn’t supposed to be engaged in social engineering, so ignore that stuff. Trade deals, immigration, national security, economic growth. Put America first. With that as a focus, you can get a lot of people under the bigtop.

“...the date the Republican Party walked away from Ted Cruz who stood on his feet all night long filibustering for you and me.” The Republican Party, as Congressmen and voters, never walked up to Cruz in order to walk away. There are multitudes of people who stand on their feet night and day doing their job. With Cruz I can safely assume is was a one-time event. And, he knew before he did it that it was just a scene-stealing moment. Trump, never being a politician and and always having the bottom line in mind, doesn’t cloak himself in political ideology. For him, building a wall in not conservative ideology, it is common sense. Ditto blocking Muslim refugees, redoing trade agreements that have de-industralized the nation, etc.



To: Ciaphas Cain

You do know that, once upon a time, the ‘Pubbies were the progressive party and the Democrats the conservatives? Lincoln had a number links to Marxists (really). https://www.amazon.com/Red-Republicans-Lincolns-Marxists-Marxism/dp/0595446981 This started changing only during the FDR administration when the Democrats dodged to the Left to buy votes and power. Parties are about power, not principles. And, apparently Trump threatens the power of both parties - which makes me feel better about voting for him!



To: odawg

Trump, never being a politician and and always having the bottom line in mind, doesnt cloak himself in political ideology. For him, building a wall in not conservative ideology, it is common sense. It is my not desire nor intention to trash Trump here and now that will occur with brickbats or hosannas on November 9 as Trump supporters seek to shift the blame or take credit. With Cruz I can safely assume is was a one-time event. And, he knew before he did it that it was just a scene-stealing moment. Except it wasn't a one-time event, it was one of a series of actions, for example he successfully lobbying the house (with the help of the win by Prof. Bratt in Virginia) against immigration amnesty. There are so many examples of Ted Cruz taking the principled conservative stand and so many examples of the people now bleating about conservative principles who turned a blind eye and a deaf ear. Even today we hear Donald Trump himself criticizing by innuendo the Speaker of the House for failing to control the budget, a fight Ted Cruz lead on time after time and did so with very very few people watching his six. How many times have you heard people excoriate politicians for failing to get out and lead but when Ted Cruz does it you call him an opportunist. How easy and cheap.

“...he successfully lobbying the house (with the help of the win by Prof. Bratt in Virginia) against immigration amnesty According to Senator Sessions, it was the election of Bratt and the defeat of amnesty proponent Cantor that changed the vote. Boehner already had the votes to pass the bill, but the next night or so Cantor was defeated. Scared the other Representatives. Cruz could do nothing with the Senate, his turf.



To: odawg

I wanted to be absolutely straightforward about this so I advanced the contribution of the election of Dave Bratt in conjunction with Ted Cruz' efforts. It was my understanding that Sen. Sessions credited both. But even if Ted Cruz ' efforts were not the efficient producing cause of blocking amnesty, how about giving him credit for the effort? Instead, the cynical slander is to distort his efforts to kill the bill by insinuating poison pills to be a sign of sellout, the opposite of the truth. This is typical of the Kafkaesque treatment of Ted Cruz around here. Are you surprised that he could avail nothing in Mitch McConnell Senate against the likes of Rubio, Schumer and McCain? It's become part of the mantra that Ted Cruz cannot be credited for his efforts on behalf of conservative values because he acted without Rinos' support as though that is his failing. Maybe you should consider that he sounded the toxin for a general awakening.

“When this all started, I compared Trump to the character in the Asimov Foundation series called The Mule.” Hey so did I!!!!!! (After the southern primaries anyway,) Trump can’t win as a “Ryan ally”. He has to run against ALL the establishment.

Cruz was abandoned by the Party, but he was rejected by conservative voters.

He just ran an awful campaign. That’s his own fault.

To: mrsmith

Ted Cruz ran a very respectable second in a field of 16 or 17 and Donald Trump got only 38% of the vote while the issue was contested.

He lost the linchpin of his campaign strategy- the southern primaries- to “the Mule”, Trump.

(The Mule is a ‘black swan’ type political character in Asimov’s story)

The he fumbled around trying to develop a new strategy and, failing, eventually allied with the GOPe at the end. I voted for him in VA as the most conservative but it was already obvious he couldn’t win the primaries or the general. Cruz didn’t lose because of his conservative beliefs, he lost because he couldn’t present them ‘winningly’.

Thanks for the post, this is right on and we must succeed with TRUMP, we CANNOT fail this time. All my long life I have heard how every election is the most important one yet, well, this election IS the most important one in my long life, WE MUST WIN!

It shouldn’t be a contest ( with the trash the Democrats are presenting) but we must overcome whatever they present and we are fortunate that we have the right man for the job.

I was a Cruz supporter early on, he seemed fit my ideology. However I was warned early on by someone who interacts with Capital Hill that Cruz was fraud and only in it for himself. I dismissed this. Then I watched Cruz slowly go from staunch conservative warrior to odd to oddball then weird and loopy! His alliance with Beck who clearly has deep severe psychological problems and all the strange public machinations that went with it. Then throw in his Father’s “strangeness” and it became clear something really is not right with Cruz. My friend’s on Cruz was vindicated or at lasted confirmed! Which brings me to Trump, Trump personality-wise is like every New York City guy I know. His political outlook is much more “pragmatic business conservative” then political science definition conservative. Its sell “the deal” get the project started & working move on to the next problem. There is no grand sweeping conservative philosophical vision, its a tactical “fix it” orientation. Maybe that’s what we need now, “fix it”, look at the bottom line get the return on investment. Anyway I am sure Trump will continue to irritate me. However at least right we have what many on this Forum have wanted to see for a long time. A candidate who not only understands what making a payroll means but one who has actually done it. I know many wish it had been somebody else, but maybe he/she doesn’t exist! Trump might be destroyer/creator we need! Go Trump!

Trump probably will not win and even if he does, its probably too late to avoid disaster anyway. At the moment there's a better than even chance that he will depending on whose projection you read. But is it too late to avoid disaster? Uh...look around. The libs are trying to elect a criminal on the order of any of the Mafia Dons in their heyday. Sexual deviation is the official policy of the federal and many of the state governments. Our foreign policy vacillates between whichever interest group comes up with the higher payoff. Our institutions have been corrupted, the Department of Justice to protect crime, the IRS to oppress anyone the capos do not like. Hell yes it's too late to avoid a disaster, we're in the middle of one. It gets worse - no individual leader, not Trump, not Reagan, not Washington, is going to dig us out of this mess. It's going to be a team effort and it's going to take longer than a single administration whether it's four or eight years, and it's going to be resisted at every turn by the very influential class that has enriched itself from the corruption. That's a long pull ahead. It can be done but let's not foster any illusions that we're going to wake up in Fairyland on 9 November.

“Maybe you should consider that he sounded the toxin for a general awakening.” Senator Sessions was the one who passonately led the opposition to the Gang of Eight bill and immigration in general. He gave the defeat of Cantor as the reason it was defeated in the House.

Ted Cruz, or any number of the other credible candidates would be light years ahead of Clinton by now because, although no candidate is perfect and all have some flaws, none of them would be weighted down with the weight of baggage we are now trying to push over the line. The country was in the mood for ALMOST any credible candidate but Clinton and her criminal enterprise.

When the Tea Party first appeared (remember that huge march on Washington?) at first I thought it should become its own party. The argument was made that a ‘new’ party would lose, badly, for several election cycles. Those same pundits noted how it would be easier and more efficient to take over the existing GOP, especially since the Republican Party already had a “conservative” tradition. We are seeing now that the GOP elite lost its conservative moorings long, long ago. The rank-and-file still believe, but not the elites. No self-respecting conservative should be able to even contemplate voting for Hillary without bursting into flames. But we’re seeing it ... The question now is whether to launch a new party with a new name, or to keep beating a dead elephant. I think our choice has already been made.

He gave the defeat of Cantor as the reason it was defeated in the House. What Sen. sessions actually said: "It was that close to being passed... and I think I can say this with integrity. Without the vigorous opposition of Ted Cruz, this bill likely would have passed."

From Breitbart: However, on Mondays program of the Mark Levin Show, Jeff Sessions who tirelessly led the opposition to Rubios amnesty and immigration expansion plan explained that Rubios retelling of history is not accurate... Sessions said that, contrary to Rubios assertion, Paul Ryan who has a two decade long history of pushing open borders immigration policies had the votes to pass Rubios amnesty plan in the House. Sessions said: What happened was that the Gang of Eight met and did this bill, they sent it to the House, I dont think there was going to be much change on it frankly. I think it was on the verge of being passed. It was scary to me. I was really worried. “...If it hadnt been for Cantors defeat, according to an NPR report recently, now Speaker of the House Ryan had the votes to get it passed He [Cantor] was defeated in his own primary over immigration, and thats what stopped it at the last minute. It almost passed. Levin pressed Sessions to further clarify: So Dave Brats defeat of Eric Cantor outside of Richmond sent a message and a tsunami message that got the attention of House Republicans, correct? Levin asked. That is correct, Sessions said. I dont think theres any doubt about that.

I have to majorly disagree with that NBF. Cruz would have been pounded by now because he’d be slathered with entrenched establishment handlers managing his fielding of democrat attacks. Add to that the unfortunate situation that he just doesn’t carry a “kick ass and take names” look and attitude into the fight. I’m in CA, and I have to work and interact with many people who have pulled the D lever over the years. Swaths of those folks are going to vote Trump, be it from having their eyes opened being a screwed over Sanders supporter or union workers who are finally getting a clue that democrats have never had their or the Republics best interest in mind. The only type of person who is going to right the ship of the Republic and get some damage control going is going to be a major crap stirrer who cares little for their political image, loves the country and will sack and burn establishment bridges at will. If absolutely nothing gets done we’re in the win column, anything we get rolled back is frosting, if we gat a wall, some renegotiated trade deals and our enemies go back to fearing the hell out of us it’s a miracle. Also, consider that Trump is probably the only candidate who’s managed to instill enough confidence in the people releasing information on the Clinton crime machine to make them believe the risk of doing so is worth it. I doubt the end game of any of the other candidates runs would have done so with the amount of corruption and cronyism we have in the acronym agencies and the media. This cycle is political war to the knife and the fallout of either sides victory will have massive repercussions on the future of the Republic. I think we got the one candidate who can instill enough confidence and sidestep the media machine enough to get the message to the masses and kick this evil witches ass and clean house on people who have riddled the political structure to enrich themselves and forward their perverse and anti Republic agendas.

he just doesnt carry a kick ass and take names look and attitude into the fight. In an election in which the public is looking for an acceptable alternative to the despised Hillary Clinton, a "kick ass" attitude is precisely what is not needed. Presidential temperament is precisely what is needed. many people who have pulled the D lever over the years. Swaths of those folks are going to vote Trump That assertion will be tested on November 8. Right now, the Real Clear average indicates the contrary. The only type of person who is going to right the ship of the Republic and get some damage control going is going to be a major crap stirrer By any objective standard that description fits Ted Cruz. And before any progress can be made, as John Kennedy said, "first you got to get elected." I think we got the one candidate who can instill enough confidence and sidestep the media machine enough to get the message to the masses Perhaps that would be necessary to carry the election against a "normal" Democrat but against the most despised woman in America, all of these tasks are unnecessary for victory.

One problem, the credible candidates you speak of would keep the borders wide open to illegals, muzzies, hb1 visas, gangs you name it Nate. Most would pass amnesty which would turn us into a third world country overnight. They lost because the republican party doesn’t represent conservatives anymore.
