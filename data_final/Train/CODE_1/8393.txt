Hama, Syria (7:45 P.M.) - Jund Al-Aqsa and Ahrar Al-Sham began a massive assault on the village of Kawkab following the detonation of a VBIED.

The VBIED seems to have struck successfully as Syrian Army units emptied their positions and attempted to contain the situation in the vicinity of the village. Syrian and Russian warplanes are relentlessly striking jihadist positions and supply lines in northern Hama.

If they manage to fortify their positions in Kawkab, the Al-Qaeda franchise of Jund Al-Aqsa and its Islamist ally Ahrar Al-Sham are likely to turn their eyes to Ma'an where they committed a horrific massacre in 2014 against the village's Allawite population.
