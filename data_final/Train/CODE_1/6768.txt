The court sentenced the man to life in prison and rewarded damages to 15 victims, marking the first time a Swedish court awards damages to victims of genocide.

According to the court, the defendant played an informal role as a leader during the mass killings that took place between April 6 and July 18, 1994. An estimates 800,000 to 1 million people were killed during the 100-day slaughter.

The prosecutorâ€™s case against the man was built around eye-witness accounts who knew the defendant and testified that they saw him carry out attacks.

In 2013, Sweden convicted and sentenced 57-year-old Swede Stanislas Mbanenande to life imprisonment for participating in massacres of tens of thousands of people in Rwanda in 1994.

His trial was the first ever in Sweden for genocide.
