Kinshasa, Aug 14

At least 45 people were killed in a terror attack in the Democratic Republic of Congo's North Kivu province, an official said on Sunday.

The assailants on Saturday attacked the village of Rwangoma, Xinhua news agency quoted the official as saying.

DR Congo President Joseph Kabila termed the attack as "pure terrorism".

"The terrorist massacre in the east is not different from what happened in Mali, France, Somalia and other corners of the world," Kabila said.

Suspected militants of the Allied Democratic Forces -- an armed group of Ugandan origin -- were responsible for the attack, the official said.

Several military operations were underway against the militants active in various parts of North Kivu.
