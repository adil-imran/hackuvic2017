AhlulBayt News Agency - Syrian Health Ministry said that an armed group of ISIS terrorist organization stormed into al-Assad Hospital in Deir Ezzor city and committed heinous massacre against the hospital’s cadre after taking medical staff hostage.



The ministry issued a statement in which it condemned the horrific massacre and offered condolences to the families of the martyrs who refused to leave the positions of their work despite the bad circumstances in which the besieged city is passing through due to the siege imposed by the terrorists on it for more than a year.



The ministry renewed its appeal to the United Nations health organizations and the rest of human and international organizations to pay attention to the enormity of what the takfiri terrorism is perpetrating in Syria, demanding them to take serious stand and put pressure on effective powers in the region for the immediate cessation of this takfiri terrorism.



The statement stressed the ministry’s keenness to continue to supply Deir Ezzor with medical tools and supplies to meet the citizens’ health needs, underlining that such brutal acts of terror will enhance the ministry determination to continue its humanitarian role with more determination and enthusiasm.



A field source reported that units of the army and armed forces wiped out a group of ISIS terrorists who infiltrated into al-Assad Hospital in Deir Ezzor and detained a number of doctors, patients and civilians.



Earlier, the armed terrorist organizations also targeted the privately owned al-Dhabeet Hospital in al-Mouhafaza neighborhood in Aleppo city, killing 3 women and injured 17 other women and children.
