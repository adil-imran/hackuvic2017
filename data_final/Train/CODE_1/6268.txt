Tunisia extends state of emergency





Tunisia has extended its state of emergency for a further three months to June 22.



As a result, the UK Foreign Office is continuing to advise against all but essential travel to the destination.



Both Thomson and Thomas Cook have already suspended their programmes to Tunisia until the start of the winter season amid uncertainty about when the Foreign Office will give the go ahead for holidaymakers to return.



They have not offered packages to the country since 38 tourists, 30 of them British, were massacred at a beach resort in Sousse last June.



The Foreign Office is continuing to advise that the threat of further attacks remains 'highly likely'.



In a statement on its website it says: "Since the terrorist attack in Sousse in June 2015, we have been working closely with the Tunisian authorities to investigate the attack and the wider threat from terrorist groups in Tunisia.



"Although we have had good co-operation from the Tunisian government, including putting in place additional security measures, the intelligence and threat picture has developed considerably, reinforcing our view that a further terrorist attack is highly likely.



"On balance, we do not believe the mitigation measures in place provide adequate protection for British tourists in Tunisia at the present time."
