Serbian ultra-nationalist Vojislav Seselj has been found not guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the Balkan wars in the 1990s.



As a result of the pronounced verdict Seselj is a free man, the presiding judge The UN war crimes court at The Hague said, BBC reports.

Vojislav Seselj was allowed to go to Belgrade in 2014 after being diagnosed with cancer and was not present in the courtroom.

The source reminds that Mr. Seselj was a close ally of late Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. He served as Serbian deputy prime minister from 1998 to 2000.

He surrendered to the ICTY voluntarily in 2003. When the court sought to appoint a defense lawyer against his wishes, he went on hunger strike.

The indictment charged him with three counts of crimes against humanity and six of war crimes for inciting ethnic cleansing in Croatia, Bosnia and the Serbian province of Vojvodina in the period August 1991-September 1993. When the trial finally opened in 2007, prosecutors argued he was criminally responsible for the murder, torture and deportation of non-Serbs as part of his project to create a "Greater Serbia", according to the source.

Seseljâ€™s acquittal follows days after Radovan Karadzic, former Bosnian Serb politician, served as the President of Republika Srpska was found guilty of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity on 24 March by international tribunal 2016 and sentenced to 40 years imprisonment in connection with his campaign to drive Bosnian Muslims and Croats out of villages claimed by Serb forces during the war.
