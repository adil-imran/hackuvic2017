Ethnic cleansing: Iran-backed militia seize Christian neighborhoods in Baghdad

Iran-backed militias have seized homes, businesses and cultural sites, including churches belonging to Baghdadâs Christian communities, forcing individuals to resettle and forfeit all their belongings, according to members of the Christian members of the Iraqi Parliament.

The militias have targeted properties belonging to Christians, forcing individuals to leave the area, according to Christian community leaders, including representatives from the Assyrian, Chaldean and Syriac minorities, as well as the Chaldean Patriarch of Iraq who have condemned the attacks, calling them a form of ethnic cleansing aimed to rid Baghdad of its Christians.

âTheir claim is that the property of a non-Christian is halal, meaning it can be seized,â Chaldean Patriarch Louis Raphael Sacco said in an interview with the pan-Arab daily Al Hayat.

The Kurds committed genocide against the Assyrians a Century ago, which has been forgotten. Which is why the idea that the Kurds are their benevolent protectors is both wrong and uncomfortable. I’m sure the refugees in Kurdistan remember well and are probably a bit nervous of an ulterior motive.

Such is the 1400 year struggle of the dhimmis under Islam. Oh the joy and peace of life as a dhimmis.

I have severed all personal ties to anyone who voted for that POS. I have to deal with a lot of them at work, but I will have absolutely nothing to do with them outside of work.

Obama’s media friends are still promoting him after all.

This Democrat controlled talking point media has wrecked their own party and has wrecked the country for years to come. What has been gained for wrecking this country so many people died for? Most of the Media would never serve the country. They have no idea about sacrifice.

Ethnic cleansing has been popular in that entire region for centuries. At lease 7 different national/ethnic groups have been guilty and/or victims.

I am sure our mosque visiting Muslim will express outrage any minute now.
