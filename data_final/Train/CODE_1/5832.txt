Military Strikes Continue Against ISIL in Iraq, Syria

From a Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve News Release

SOUTHWEST ASIA, Aug. 15, 2016 â€“ U.S. and coalition military forces continued to attack Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant terrorists in Iraq and Syria yesterday, Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve officials reported today.

Officials reported details of the latest strikes, noting that assessments of results are based on initial reports.

Strikes in Syria

Attack, fighter and remotely piloted aircraft conducted seven strikes in Syria:

-- Near Albu Kamal, a strike destroyed an ISIL oil wellhead and ISIL-used oil equipment.

-- Near Ayn Isa, two strikes struck an ISIL staging area and an ISIL weapons storage facility.

-- Near Mara, two strikes destroyed an ISIL fighting position and damaged four separate ISIL fighting positions.

-- Near Tal Abyad, two strikes struck an ISIL tactical unit and destroyed four ISIL vehicles.

Strikes in Iraq

Fighter and remotely piloted aircraft conducted seven strikes in Iraq, coordinated with and in support of Iraq's government:

-- Near Mosul, three strikes struck two separate ISIL tactical units and an ISIL improvised explosive device assembly area; destroyed an ISIL vehicle, six ISIL assembly areas, two ISIL command and control nodes and one ISIL vehicle bomb; suppressed an ISIL heavy machine gun position; and denied ISIL access to terrain.

-- Near Qayyarah, two strikes struck a large ISIL tactical unit; destroyed two ISIL vehicles, five ISIL fighting positions, an ISIL mortar system, an ISIL rocket rail, four ISIL rocket systems, three ISIL assembly areas, an ISIL command-and-control node and an ISIL heavy machine gun; disabled an ISIL vehicle bomb; and denied ISIL access to terrain.

-- Near Sinjar, a strike struck an ISIL tactical unit and destroyed an ISIL fighting position.

-- Near Sultan Abdallah, a strike destroyed an ISIL headquarters.

Task force officials define a strike as one or more kinetic events that occur in roughly the same geographic location to produce a single, sometimes cumulative, effect. Therefore, officials explained, a single aircraft delivering a single weapon against a lone ISIL vehicle is one strike, but so is multiple aircraft delivering dozens of weapons against buildings, vehicles and weapon systems in a compound, for example, having the cumulative effect of making those targets harder or impossible for ISIL to use. Accordingly, officials said, they do not report the number or type of aircraft employed in a strike, the number of munitions dropped in each strike, or the number of individual munition impact points against a target. Ground-based artillery fired in counterfire or in fire support to maneuver roles is not classified as a strike.

Part of Operation Inherent Resolve

The strikes were conducted as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, the operation to eliminate the ISIL terrorist group and the threat they pose to Iraq, Syria, and the wider international community. The destruction of ISIL targets in Syria and Iraq further limits the terrorist group's ability to project terror and conduct operations, officials said.

Coalition nations that have conducted strikes in Iraq include the United States, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Jordan, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Coalition nations that have conducted strikes in Syria include the United States, Australia, Bahrain, Canada, France, Jordan, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.
