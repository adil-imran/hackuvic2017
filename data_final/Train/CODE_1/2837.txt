A passenger was held by police when he sparked a security alert on a plane after having a furious argument with his wife.

Peter Kempton, 43, was travelling to Corfu with his 50-year-old wife last Monday when their Thomas Cook flight from East Midlands Airport made an unscheduled landing in Italy due to bad weather.

Mr Kempton, from Lincoln, allegedly left the aircraft and ran down the steps which were attached to the plane as it was being refuelled at Brindisi Airport.

A Thomas Cook spokesperson said: 'Passenger safety is paramount and the crew decided it was best for all for the couple to be removed from the flight'

He was stopped by police and the pilot ordered his wife off the flight.

Local newspaper the Brindisi Report claimed said Mr Kempton was charged for failing to comply with air safety standards.

He is not believed to be under investigation in the UK.

A Thomas Cook spokesperson said: 'A couple were removed from a flight to Corfu after it stopped in Italy.

'Passenger safety is paramount and the crew decided it was best for all for the couple to be removed from the flight and the matter is now in the hands of the Italian police.'

This comes after a British tourist was fined Â£3,000 after he defecated on the runway of the same Italian airport after stepping off a three-hour Ryanair flight from Manchester.

David Sharp, 68, of Salford, had flown into Brindisi Airport in Apulia in southern Italy last week with the budget carrier and was making his way to the terminal building after leaving the aircraft.

Italian media reported that he then began to defecate on the asphalt between the aircraft and the gate to the terminal building.

When confronted by Italian border police, he was unable to give an explanation for what he had done and was described as being in a state of 'mild agitation'.
