JUSTICE has been served after Phillip Tolentino Avino who was accused of killing five persons in 2014 at Kayang-Hilltop has been sentenced to suffer reclusion perpetua without any eligibility of parole for five counts of murder in a decision penned by RTC branch 4 Judge Mia Joy Cawed issued January 28.

Two years ago, Jackelyn Nociete, 19, Joey Nociete, 9, their playmates: Raymundo del Mundo, 8, Dave de Guzman, 7, and the 32-year-old maid Jonalyn Lozano were repeatedly stabbed to death inside their apartment on Kayang Street.

Aveno, a fruit vendor, fled to Manila after the killing but surrendered to Manila Vice Mayor Isko Moreno.

Autoposy reports show Aveno used a double-bladed knife in the killing, stabbing Jackelyn 18 times, Joey, 12 times, Raymundo, eight times, Dave, five times, and Jonalyn 12 times.

It is reported that Aveno was a former lover of the Nociete’s carenderia cook and is suspected to hold a grudge against the family for allegedly hiding his girlfriend from him.

Blood samples taken from the crime scene matched the DNA of Avino.

The victim’s family members were present during the court decision and rejoiced at the ruling but rued it cannot bring back the life of their children.

Vilma Nociete, mother of victims, had to be brought out of the courtroom to be consoled.

The Kayang massacre has been tagged as the worst crime in the history of the City, prompting Mayor Mauricio Domogan to put up a P100,000 reward for the capture of Aveno.
