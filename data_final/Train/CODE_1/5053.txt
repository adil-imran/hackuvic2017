A general view shows the damage at a site of an explosion in Bab Tadmor in Homs, Syria.

Many people were killed in four explosions that hit government-held parts of Syria on Monday. The blasts happened in the cities of Tartous and Homs, and in the countryside outside Damascus, state media and a monitor said. As the toll of dead kept climbing, social media was flooded with horrified users commenting on the situation of the country and its people.

Aisha Mirza: “A mother loses her young child, Hassan. She is struggling to cope � Lots of videos I saw but this one broke my heart and made me cry so hard. May Allah give her and all the mothers patience and strength. #Syria”

Nick Ross Lewin: “Perspective, quote,”80% of UK citizens have never seen the milky-way. This is an absolute tragedy. It’s a bit of a shame, Children lying under a building in a bombed out city in Syria. That’s an absolute tragedy.”

Ben Sims: “One week you say, how sad it is a Syria boy has lost his whole family, but the next week you say you would kill 250,000 palestinian people and children. A society with common sense would say these people have no emotion. They are not the same as us! Our leaders are cold hearted planners. They plan on human love and emotions. They show us images to make us react and not think. The sick elite. Us, well most people think with their hearts not heads. We need to get rid of these parasites.”

Bardha Qokaj: “There are no words anymore to describe what is happening in Syria.”

The Syria Campaign: “Ahmad Alhamodn was a Syrian journalist, a photographer, a husband, a father. Yesterday he died in hospital after he had been hit by a barrel bomb attack 16 days ago. Last week, Ahmad’s wife who was 8 months pregnant died from her injuries from the same attack. Before she entered a coma she was able to deliver a healthy daughter, who is now going to grow up without either of her parents.

Ahmad was one of the founders of the Aleppo Media Centre, a group dedicated to showing the world the plight of Syrian civilians living under Assad and Russian bombs.

Ahmad spent his life telling stories of tragedy and hope from Aleppo, now the world has lost another person working for peace in Syria.

Today we remember this hero and his family.

RIP Ahmad.”

@getpromotionpr: “Can there be anything left to blow up in #Syria? Can’t be much left of anywhere.”

@poukigwe: “Thousands of child refugees have arrived in the UK. And hundreds of them are missing...”
