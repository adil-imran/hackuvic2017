SRINAGAR: A BSF jawan was accidentally killed while he was responding to firing by Pakistani troops from across the border in Macchil sector along the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir. A top BSF official had earlier said that constable Nitin Subhash was killed in firing by Pakistani troops, but it was later clarified by the force that he died after being grievously injured in an explosion caused due to recoil."Subhash was injured due to recoil and was admitted to a medical facility where he succumbed late last night," BSF IG (Kashmir) Vikash Chandra said.28-year-old Subhash, hailing from Sangli in Maharashtra, had joined BSF in 2008 and is survived by his wife and two sons aged four and two years.Meanwhile, Pakistan Rangers violated ceasefire in RS Pura and Kathua sectors along International Border on Saturday.In Macchil sector, terrorists, aided by the cover fire by Pakistani Army , had on Friday night crossed the Line of Control. They killed a jawan and mutilated his body prompting the Indian Army to warn that "the incident will be responded to appropriately".Four army and three BSF personnel have died in the latest escalation along the boundary with Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir.In Friday night's attack, one militant was also killed."In an encounter close to the Line of Control this evening, one solider was martyred and one terrorist was killed. The terrorists mutilated the body of the jawan before fleeing back into Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir under the cover of firing by Pakistan Army," an Army spokesman had said on Friday.He said the incident reflected the barbarism pervading in official and unofficial organisations in Pakistan.Two civilians were also killed and as many injured yesterday after Pakistani troops pounded civilian areas and forward India posts with 120mm mortar shells and automatic weapons in Jammu, Kathua, Poonch and Rajouri districts.The BSF said on Friday that it had killed 15 Pakistani soldiers in retaliatory firing along international border so far after the flare up started.
