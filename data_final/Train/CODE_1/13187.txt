Ugwuanyi parleys royal fathers, town union leaders

Christopher Isiguzo in Enugu

The Inspector General of Police, Solomon Arase, on Wednesday visited the Ukpabi, Nimbo community of Uzo-Uwani Local Government Area in Enugu State where scores of persons were massacred last Monday by suspected Fulani herdsmen.

He was there to have an on-the-spot assessment of the situation, vowing to find a lasting solution to the problem posed by the activities of the herders.

Apparently to demonstrate police dismay about the challenge, the police chief immediately ordered the detention of a policeman, simply identified as Corporal Chukwu, who allegedly collaborated with the Fulani herdsmen during the killing of residents of the community.

Arase directed that the policeman be detained and properly investigated, assuring that once the allegations against him were confirmed, he would not only leave the police but would be prosecuted.

He also pledged the readiness of the police to do all in its powers to ensure that those involved in the gruesome murder of the villagers were arrested and prosecuted.

This came as the community remained deserted as schools, homes and public places remained shut, two days after the incident.
