He broke the hearts of Poldark fans everywhere when he was recently spotted kissing a brunette beauty from Sweden.

And now Aidan Turner appears to have found a strikingly similar new love interest.

The 33-year-old hunk was recently spotted enjoying a lunch with a glamorous mystery brunette, who is thought to be a British artist who has worked with Banksy, dated Sienna Miller's ex and was previously linked to Robert Pattinson.

Heartbreaker: Aidan Turner appears to have found a new love interest

It is believed the mystery woman is 28-year-old pencil artist Nettie Wakefield, who has worked alongside top artists such as Banksy and Damian Hirst.

The stunning Londoner previously dated Tom Sturridge - a British actor who has a daughter with Sienna Miller - and has also been linked to Twilight star Robert Pattinson.

Earlier this month, she posted a picture of Turner in her studio, sitting over one of her pieces of work, with the caption: 'Arrived at my studio today to find a strange man correcting my mistakes #creep.'

Weeks later, the 33-year-old actor spotted enjoying a boozy lunch at a club in Mayfair, London, where he spent time drinking wine, smoking and slow dancing on the pavement with a woman believed to be Ms Wakefield.

A fellow diner at the club said they were 'all over each other'.

'They didn't order a bottle but were downing white wine by the glass. They seemed to be besotted with each other,' they said.

Aidan could not keep his hands off the beauty as they drank white wine and smoked outside an club in west London.

The artist posted a picture of him earlier this month which showed him pretending to work on one of her sketches, with the caption: 'Arrived at my studio to find a strange man correcting my mistakes'

Keeping things casual in black jeans and a T shirt combined with leather boots, Aidan looked smitten as the woman perched on his lap.

She, too, opted for a relaxed ensemble, donning tights and a skirt as she let her long locks flow over her shoulders, accessorising with earrings and a dangling necklace.

It comes after the Irishman was last month spotted kissing Swedish advertising executive Tara Derakshan while out in the West End.

Aidan and his latest flame spent all afternoon and went on into the evening smoking, drinking, and kissing and slow dancing on the pavement outside the club.

A fellow diner at the club said: 'I couldn't believe it was him. They didn't have much to eat, just a starter.

'They were all over each other in the restaurant. They didn't order a bottle but were downing white wine by the glass. They seemed to be besotted with each other.'

Aidan, who was in a relationship with actress Sarah Greene for five years, recently hinted he would like to go out with someone outside the acting world, saying dating someone in the same profession can be 'dull and taxing'.

Sunday night's episode of Poldark caused a stir as the BBC came under fire for what some campaigners viewed as a rape scene.

Ross Poldark turns up unannounced at the house of his former fiancee Elizabeth, played by Heida Reed.

He kicks in the door and demands that she cancels her wedding to his enemy George Warleggan.

She ignores what he says and instead asks him to leave, prompting him to take her face in his hands and forcefully kiss her.

When she pushes him away and insists she loves George, he forces another kiss on her before looking at the bed.

Elizabeth tells Poldark: 'You will not dare. You will not dare.' He replies: 'I would Elizabeth. I would and so will you.'

The lead character then pushes her on to the bed and she appears to finally give in to him.

The BBC insists that the scene shows consensual sex â€“ but it has angered rape campaigners, legal experts and MPs.

Prominent anti-rape campaigner Julie Bindel said there was no doubt in her mind that the scene depicted a rape. Ms Bindel, who has served as a Home Office expert, said: 'We are seeing rape. It's wholly irresponsible.'

And leading criminal barrister Matthew Scott said: 'It is rape. If I saw that in evidence on CCTV from a hotel room I would convict him.'

Sarah Green, co-director at charity End Violence Against Women, said: 'It is definitely portrayed very much as a rape.

'The female character says 'no' and there are also non-verbal signs. She is moving away from him and pulling away from him. There is lots of stuff that is ambiguous.'
