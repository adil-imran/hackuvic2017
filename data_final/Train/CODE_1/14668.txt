At least 124 students were among 126 people killed on Tuesday when heavily-armed Arabic speaking Taliban suicide attackers stormed an army-run school, shooting from classroom-to classroom and taking several hostages using them as human shield in Pakistan’s volatile Peshawar city.

The Pakistani military said five Taliban militants had been killed at a school they attacked in the city of Peshawar on Tuesday, and that they were searching for remaining gunmen. “Remaining clearance in progress,” the military said in a tweet.

A group of 8-10 suicide attackers wearing paramilitary Frontier Corps uniforms entered Army Public School on Warsak Road around 10.30 (local time) and started indiscriminate firing, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Pervez Khattak said.

In one of the most gruesome attacks in recent years against children anywhere in the world, the militants went from classroom-to-classroom shooting indiscriminately at the shocked students, eyewitnesses told local media.

One rescued student told reporters that the attackers had long beards and they were wearing ‘shalwar kamiz’. He said they were speaking Arabic and looked foreigners.

At least 24 bodies were lying in the Lady Reading Hospital (LRH) and 60 others in Combined Military Hospital (CMH), Khattak said. At least 43 injured have been shifted to LRH, 40 to CMH and others to nearby hospitals.

Addressing the media in Peshawar, Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said ,”We will continue our struggle to eradicate terrorism.”

Sharif further added, “We have also spoken to Afghanistan and we will fight terrorism together. Country should not lose its strength. Such attacks are expected in the wake of a war” he added.
