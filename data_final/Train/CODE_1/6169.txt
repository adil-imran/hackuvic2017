Speicher massacre: 36 men executed for role in Iraq

Taiwan Sun Sunday 21st August, 2016

• UN condemns decision, expresses concern over fast track executions

• After deadly blast in March, PM Abadi resolved to quickly execute those arrested for terrorism

• Dhigar governor, Justice minister oversee executions of convicts

NASIRIYAH, Iraq - The execution of 36 men convicted of their role in the Speicher massacre (ISIS-led massacre of soldiers in 2014) was carried out by Iraq on Sunday.

A spokesman for the governor’s office in Dhiqar is said to have confirmed in a statement, “The executions of 36 convicted over the Speicher crime were carried out this morning in Nasiriyah prison.”

Iraqi President Fuad Masum had given approval for hanging the convicts despite pressure from human rights groups.

The governor of Dhiqar, Yahya al-Nasseri and Justice minister Haidar al-Zamili oversaw the executions.

The U.N. has expressed concern over the development saying that “fast-tracking executions will only accelerate injustice.”

However, the families of those killed brutally in the Speicher massacre welcomed the President’s decision.

Last month, Iraq lost 300 citizens to a bomb blast following which Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said he would speed up the execution of those sentenced to death for terrorist acts.

The Speicher massacre happened in 2014 when 1,700 recruits were kidnapped from a base near Tikrit and executed by the Islamic State group. The ISIS released photos and documents of the massacre later. Mass graves were also discovered a year after the incident.

Of the recruits who lost their lives, 400 belonged to Dhiqar province.
