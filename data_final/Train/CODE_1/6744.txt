Palestinians all over the world mark May 15 as a day of loss and displacement after the Zionist militias ethnically cleansed 531 Palestinian villages and made more than 750,000 Palestinians refugees. Protests, galleries and speeches are organized every year to mark this turning point in Palestinian history. This year, Palestinians and their supporters took to the streets as well as to social media to mark Nakba, their catastrophe. Here is how Nakba was marked on twitter this year:

Ethnic cleansing of Palestinians was a deliberate act of Zionist forces not an unintended consequence of war. #Nakba pic.twitter.com/QBUUmaOBCg — The IMEU (@theIMEU) May 14, 2016

Social media has helped Palestinians reach out to more people after mainstream Western media outlets have excluded them, giving Palestinians a better opportunity to reach out to more potential supporters.

Israel’s ‘Independence Day’ has been widely challenged by Palestinians and their supporters on social media. Palestinians question when this virtual challenge will turn into a concrete one. Only time will answer this question.
