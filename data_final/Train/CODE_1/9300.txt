The Syrian government has strongly denounced the recent massacre by Daesh Takfiri terrorists in the eastern Deir al-Zour Province, saying the responsibility for the crime lies with the supporters of terrorist groups operating across the Arab state.

In two identical letters to United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and the head of the UN Security Council, the Syrian Foreign Ministry said that such killings are a continuation of a series of barbaric and methodical terrorist acts by armed groups, Syriaâ€™s official news agency SANA reported on Tuesday.

The ministry said the militant groups are receiving funds from some regional countries as well as states outside the region, noting that these countries recruit terrorists to serve their interests.

The ministry also pointed out that such crimes would not have happened without the constant funding, arming, and logistic support provided by intelligence agencies of certain states especially Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey.

The Syrian government affirms its determination to continue defending the Syrian people and confronting terrorism, the ministry emphasized.

The letter also reiterates its call for the UN chief and the Security Council to condemn such terrorist acts.

It also urges the UN to assume its responsibilities regarding counter-terrorism by taking proper measures against certain states that continue to conspire against Syria.

The developments come as Daesh Takfiri terrorists recently kidnapped at least 400 civilians, including women and children, in an assault on al-Baghaliyeh neighborhood of of Deir al-Zour.

All of the abductees were Sunni Muslims, including families of pro-government fighters. They were transported to other areas under Daesh control.

Following its Saturday attack on Deir al-Zour, some 300 civilians were killed in the Daesh attack on the troubled city.
