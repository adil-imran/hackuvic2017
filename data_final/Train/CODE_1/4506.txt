1986 - The US-Soviet talks in Iceland ended in failure with both US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev blaming each other for the outcome. Reagan speaking to US servicemen near Reykjavik, said he had made Moscow an historic offer on arms control which Gorbachev had rejected. Gorbachev, addressing a news conference in the Icelandic capital, said the US leader had come to the meeting with empty hands and the talks had collapsed. “This has been a failure and failure when we were very close to an historic agreement,” the Kremlin chief added. Gorbachev said the world was approaching a point of no return because US-Soviet arms talks were practically at a standstill. US Secretary of State George Shultz said the talks had ended with no new agreement on arms control and no date had been set for a new formal summit. Shultz said the mini-summit had stalled over the issue of Reagan’s ‘star wars’ space defence programme.
