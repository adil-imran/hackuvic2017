Hama, SANA-A new massacre and lines of criminality were designed by mercenary terrorists against civilians, the majority of them children, women and elderly, in al-Zara village, located in the remote south of Hama.

Tens of martyrs, wounded and lost citizens were the outcome of this bloody terrorism and acts of looting, mutilation and burglary, similar to a systemized genocide perpetrated against those civilians by so-called Jabhat al-Nusra and Ahrar al-Sham and other terrorist organizations.

A number of the locals of al-Zara town in the southern countryside of Hama who survived the massacre committed by terrorist groups against the locals of the town at dawn said members of those terrorist groups attacked the town and killed children and women in homes and roads.

Speaking to SANA, mayor of the village Ahmad al-Qasem said that the armed terrorist groups infiltrated into the town at dawn while its people were sleeping, raided homes and killed children, women and elderly in a brutal manner, adding that terrorists killed his mother and his aunt, kidnapped his uncle and killed his sons.

He pointed out that the terrorists were using PKC machine guns, laser sniper rifles and RPG shells which they fired at houses before they broke into them and killed families.

A survivor added that around ten families are lost, indicating that the terrorists killed some of the abducted persons on the spot, while another survivor said that the terrorist groups had flattened houses in the town.

Other survivors confirmed that they contacted members of the Syrian Arab Army to rescue the injured and to evacuate them to safe areas.

On Thursday, terrorists of Jabhat al-Nusra and other armed affiliated to it infiltrated into al-Zara town and committed a massacre against its locals and abducted a number of children and women, destroyed and stole the localsâ€™ properties and houses.
