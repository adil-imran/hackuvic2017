Rights group Amnesty International on Thursday accused Sudanese government forces of killing scores of civilians, including many children, in suspected chemical weapons attacks in a mountainous area of war-torn Darfur. More than 30 such attacks are believed to have been carried out on several villages as part of a massive military campaign against rebels in Darfur's Jebel Marra between January and September, Amnesty said in a report. The rights group estimated that up to 250 people may have died as a result of exposure to the chemical weapons agents in attacks that amount to "war crimes" and "crimes against humanity."

The evidence we have gathered is credible and portrays a regime that is intent on directing attacks against the civilian population in Darfur without any fear of international retribution. Amnesty International's crisis research director Tirana Hassan

Sudan's ambassador to the United Nations, Omer Dahab Fadl Mohamed, rejected the report as "baseless and fabricated," adding that the report was aimed at destabilizing the peace process in Sudan. Darfur has been engulfed in a deadly conflict since 2003, when ethnic minority groups took up arms against President Omar al-Bashir's Arab-dominated government, which launched a brutal counterinsurgency. Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court on war crimes and genocide charges related to Darfur, which he denies. In recent months, Sudan has insisted that the conflict in Darfur has ended, and that it wants U.N. peacekeepers who have been present in the region since 2007 to leave.

[Darfur] has been stuck in a catastrophic cycle of violence for more than 13 years. Nothing has changed except that the world has stopped watching. Hassan
