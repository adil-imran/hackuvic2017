House President Yiannakis Omirou called on Thursday on the international community to prevent any Turkish plans against Cyprus and contribute towards achieving the just cause of the people of Cyprus.

Speaking during the last House plenary meeting, before May’s parliamentary elections, Omirou stressed the need to intensify “our efforts to find a just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem” in view of Turkey`s continuing intransigence and the particular difficult conditions which the people of Cyprus are going through today.

Omirou noted that the rejection of the Annan plan for a Cyprus settlement, in 2004, by the vast majority of Greek Cypriots, does not under any circumstances mean that the people of Cyprus reject a solution. The people expressed in this way their will for a settlement based on UN decisions and resolutions, the high level agreements between the island’s two communities and EU fundamental principles and values, he added.

Commenting on the anniversary of the coup d` etat in Greece, on April 21, 1967, Omirou referred to its disastrous repercussions for the Greek people and Cyprus as well, and expressed the parliament`s readiness to safeguard democracy, and the social and economic welfare of the Cypriot people, and to continue to strive for an end to Turkey’s continuing occupation of the island’s northern part.

Moreover, referring to the National Day of Remembrance for the Armenian Nation Genocide on April 24, established by the House of Representatives, Omirou denounced ethnic cleansing and expansionist designs by Turkey, expressing full support and solidarity with the Armenian people.

The members of parliament observed a minute’s silence for the victims of the Armenian genocide and the victims of the seven-year dictatorship in Greece.
