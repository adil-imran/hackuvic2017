The handful of Christian families remaining in ISIS’ Syrian stronghold of Raqqa have been forbidden from fleeing the city, according to a tweet from a secret group that reports from inside the caliphate, reported Foxnews.

The activist group “Raqqa is Being Silently Slaughtered” said the black-clad terrorist army issued a decree that any Christians, including Armenians, still within city limits may not leave.

It is believed that there are just more than 40 Christian families left in the city.

There are rumors among the locals that the ISIS militants plan to massacre the remaining Christians in Raqqa.

According to another theory, after the liberation of Palmyra, an ancient Semitic city in Syria, the Russian-Syrian delegation now plans to take control of Raqqa, and that is why ISIS is going to use the Christians as human shields.
