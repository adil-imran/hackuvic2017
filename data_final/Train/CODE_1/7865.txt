NK India, New Delhi, Oct 1 : Hafiz Saeed, Chief of Jamaat-ud-Dawa and founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba, is the "real Prime Minister of Pakistan" and that the creation of Pakistan in the existing geographical landscape was erroneous, Pakistan-born Canadian author Tarek Fatah said on Saturday.

"I don't know why you people in India are into so much deep philosophy that you fail to see who is running the country. Their (Jamaat-ud-Dawa) soldiers massacred 30 lakh Bengalis in 10 months, they can throw Baloch young men from aircraft, rape young girls," Fatah, who was born in Karachi, said in an interview to India TV.



He further said: "After the 1971 war, when nearly 90,000 Pakistani prisoners of war were released by Indira Gandhi, they were deployed by the Pakistan army to carry out more massacres in Balochistan from 1973 to 1975".



According to a release from the TV channel, Fatah also said, "Pakistan is an acronym, it is not a country in itself... Pakistan was a joke played on all of us".



Fatah said, "Pakistan was created by the nawabs of UP and Bihar who were afraid of democracy. They should have created Pakistan on the borders of Nepal, but instead, they went on to create Pakistan out of Punjab, where the Muslim League had lost".



Fatah who is also a broadcaster, liberal activist and founder of the Muslim Canadian Congress, said Balochistan "was independent" and was only "forcibly occupied" by the Pakistan Army in 1947.



He also criticised Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and the Pakistani Army Chief General Raheel Sharif for their style of functioning.



Sharif, he said, had "amassed" wealth and invested only in Punjab.



The Pakistani writer also described Hizbul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin as the "real Defence Minister of Pakistan".
