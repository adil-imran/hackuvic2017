Ethnic cleansing is raging throughout Central Africa, as a war-weary United Nations remains inert. History will judge the leaders of Africa very harshly for allowing the continent to be mutilated while they sat passively, passing toothless resolutions.

We are witnessing carnage of epic proportions, whose savagery defies description. Leaders have gone berserk across Central Africa. Their countries have become killing zones. Men, women and children are being slaughtered in a tribal ritual that borders on total insanity. Africa has been at war for almost 50 years. Thirty million Africans have died in a multitude of wars since the 1950's.
