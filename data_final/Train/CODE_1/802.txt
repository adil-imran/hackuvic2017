Hamburg , October 11, 2016 Capital Stage AG The Management Board Important information This announcement is for information purposes only. It is neither an offer to exchange, purchase or sale nor a solicitation of an offer to exchange shares of CHORUS Clean Energy AG, but constitutes a legally required announcement according to the WpÜG in the context of a public takeover offer. Furthermore this announcement is neither an offer to exchange, purchase or sale nor a solicitation of an offer to exchange shares of Capital Stage . The final terms and further provisions regarding the public Takeover Offer are disclosed in the offer document that has been approved by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht). Investors and holders of CHORUS shares are strongly recommended to read the offer document and all announcements in connection with the public takeover offer as they contain or will contain important information. The takeover offer will be conducted exclusively on the basis of the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, in particular, the German Securities and Takeover Act and the regulation on the Content of the Offer Document, Consideration for Takeover Offers and Mandatory Offers and the Release from the Obligation to Publish and Issue an Offer (the "WpÜGAngebV"). The Exchange Offer is made in the USA on the basis of an exception to the rules for takeover offers in accordance with rule 14d-1(c) of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Securities Exchange Act") and the offer and the issue of the shares of the Bidder offered here (as defined in item 3 of this Offer Document) is made on the basis of an exception to the US registration rules pursuant to rule 802 of the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Exchange Offer is otherwise made under the applicable German provisions. The Exchange Offer is made for the securities of a German company. The Exchange Offer is therefore subject to disclosure and other procedural provisions - for instance in relation to withdrawal rights, the offer timetable, settlement provisions and the date on which the consideration is rendered - that may differ from the disclosure and procedural rules used in US exchange offers. Financial statements included in the offer document, if any, have been prepared in accordance with foreign accounting standards that may not be comparable to the financial statements of US companies. It may be difficult for you to enforce your rights and any claim you may have arising under the federal securities laws, since the Bidder and CHORUS are located in Germany , and some or all of their officers and directors may be residents of a foreign country. You may not be able to sue a foreign company or its officers or directors in a foreign court for violations of the US securities laws. It may be difficult to compel a foreign company and its affiliates to subject themselves to a US court's judgment. The Bidder may purchase securities otherwise than under the Exchange Offer. Subject to item 1.2 of the offer document, the publication, mailing, dissemination or distribution of the offer document and other documents associated with the Takeover Offer outside the Federal Republic is prohibited for third parties.
