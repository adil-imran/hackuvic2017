Since their occupation of Mosul in 2014, ISIS militants have destroyed priceless museum artifacts, burned thousands of books, bulldozed churches and mosques, and demolished ancient archaeological sites. The irreparable devastation mirrors their ruthless treatment of entire communities of people.

In the Northern provinces of Iraq, ISIS radicals have forced hundreds of thousands of Christians, Yazidis, and Shia Muslims from their homes. In addition to the mass exodus and killings, the militants have also eradicated countless relics of their ancient history and heritage.

It is not the first time this type of purgation has taken place. After the horrors of the World War II holocaust, Jewish legal scholar Raphael Lemkin coined the term “genocide,” and later expanded it to include cultural genocide, or cultural cleansing. The latter concept describes the deliberate destruction of historical artifacts and structures during wartime simply because they do not conform to an oppressor’s ideology.

One of the worst examples of cultural cleansing was ISIS’ destruction of the ancient walls of Nineveh. In January 2015, militants used explosives to demolish the picturesque fortifications, which were built by King Sennacherib in the eight century B.C. The site is considered one of the most important archaeological structures in the Middle East.

Intellectual treasures are also frequent targets of ISIS’ purging. A month after destroying the Nineveh walls, attackers seized Mosul’s central library, burning over 100,000 books and manuscripts. Several university libraries in the city shared the same fate.
