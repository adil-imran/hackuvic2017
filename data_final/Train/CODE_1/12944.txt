Soldiers clean up Krue Se mosque in Thailand's largely Muslim province of Pattani, 1,150 kilometres (718 miles) south of Bangkok on April 29, 2004, after after a shoot out between police and militants that killed 34 rebels. Hundreds of troops fanned out across southern Thailand to restore order after a day of carnage in which security forces shot dead more than 100 Muslim militants wielding guns and machetes.
