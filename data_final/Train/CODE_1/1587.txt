Famous quotes by Mia Farrow: "I can match bottoms with anyone in Hollywood!" "To meet in such a distant place. It's so random. Isn't it grand?" "In the beginning, I tried to reach out to her, ... but I decided it would be best for me and the rest of the children to just close ranks and protect ourselves. I'll probably never see her again." "I don't know how the courts permitted this, ... especially in light of a judge not allowing Mr. Allen to see his own children." "Women in Africa, generally a lot needs to be done for women. Women are not being educated, not only in Angola but my trip to Nigeria, one point I would make over and over again was that women need to be educated too." "I get it now; I didn't get it then. That life is about losing and about doing it as gracefully as possible... and enjoying everything in between." "There are people who are suffering beyond description. They are innocent people, they didn't bring this upon themselves. They are the victims of the sins of other people. And while it's hard to see, it's important to understand that these people exist." "I want a big career, a big man, and a big life. You have to think big - that's the only way to get it... I just couldn't stand being anonymous."
