Syria says east Aleppo ceasefire has begun, promises 'safe exit'

Reuters ^ | October 21st, 2016 | By Suleiman Al-Khalidi | AMMAN

Posted on by Mariner

The Syrian military said on Thursday a unilateral ceasefire backed by Russia had come into force to allow people to leave besieged eastern Aleppo, a move rejected by rebels who say they are preparing a counter-offensive to break the blockade.

State media earlier said the army had opened exit corridors in two designated areas in the Bustan al Qasr quarter and near the Castello road in northern Aleppo city. Waiting buses were shown on state television.

Intensified Russian and Syrian bombing of besieged rebel-held parts of Aleppo in the past weeks has hit hospitals, bakeries and water pumping stations, and killed hundreds of civilians.

The United Nations has criticized unilateral ceasefires after long sieges, saying they can be helpful only if combined with humanitarian access for those who do not want to leave.

The 250,000 civilians trapped inside the besieged rebel held parts of the city have so far stayed away from the corridors. The army blames rebels opposed to President Bashar al-Assad for preventing them leaving and says they use civilians as human shields.

Rebels say the goal of Moscow and Assad is to empty rebel-held areas of civilians so they can take over the whole city.

"They talk about humanitarian corridors, but why are they not allowing food into besieged eastern Aleppo to alleviate our suffering? We only need the Russian bombers to stop killing our children. We don't want to leave," said Ammar al Qaran, a resident in Sakhour district.

Syrian army offers them free passage out of the war zone to safety, and the UN wants to supply them in the zone. All the while the US and Turkey supply weapons and material support to the "rebels".

If I am not mistaken, the last cease-fire in Syria was broken less than a day later by guess who? The U.S.A.

“Rebels say the goal of Moscow and Assad is to empty rebel-held areas of civilians so they can take over the whole city” Dang it! Who told them the plans??

Physical opposition requires huge amounts of money and equipment. You ever wonder who’s funding the so-called Syrian rebels? I’ve a sneaky suspicion that U.S money is making it’s way to fund the Syrian rebels — in turn funding ISIS in whole or in part. Syria is the last Secular country in the region — aside from Israel.

Here's Trump's VP, Mike Pence, on the issue of Obama, Russia, Syria and the Ukraine... From the Oct 5, 2016 first VP debate... From the Oct 5, 2016 first VP debate... When Donald Trump and I observe that, as Ive said, in Syria, in Iran, in Ukraine, that the small and bullying leader of Russia has been stronger on the world stage than this administration, thats stating painful facts. Thats not an endorsement of Vladimir Putin  thats an indictment of the weak and feckless leadership of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. ______________________________ Also from the Oct 5, 2016 first VP debate... QUIJANO (Moderator): I want to turn now to Syria. Two hundred fifty thousand people, 100,000 of them children, are under siege in Aleppo, Syria. Bunker buster bombs, cluster munitions, and incendiary weapons are being dropped on them by Russian and Syrian militaries. Does the U.S. have a responsibility to protect civilians and prevent mass casualties on this scale, Governor Pence? PENCE: The United States of America needs to begin to exercise strong leadership to protect the vulnerable citizens and over 100,000 children in Aleppo. Hillary Clintons top priority when she became secretary of state was the Russian reset, the Russians reset. After the Russian reset, the Russians invaded Ukraine and took over Crimea. And the small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States to the point where all the United States of America  the greatest nation on Earth  just withdraws from talks about a cease-fire while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria while he marshals the forces and begins  look, we have got to begin to lean into this with strong, broad-shouldered American leadership. It begins by rebuilding our military. And the Russians and the Chinese have been making enormous investments in the military. We have the smallest Navy since 1916. We have the lowest number of troops since the end of the Second World War. Weve got to work with Congress, and Donald Trump will, to rebuild our military and project American strength in the world. But about Aleppo and about Syria, I truly do believe that what America ought to do right now is immediately establish safe zones, so that families and vulnerable families with children can move out of those areas, work with our Arab partners, real time, right now, to make that happen. And secondly, I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength. And if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say, to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo. Theres a broad range of other things that we ought to do, as well. We ought to deploy a missile defense shield to the Czech Republic and Poland which Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama pulled back on out of not wanting to offend the Russians back in 2009. QUIJANO: Governor, your two minutes are up. PENCE: Weve just got to have American strength on the world stage. When Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, the Russians and other countries in the world will know theyre dealing with a strong American president. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/us/politics/vice-president-transcript.html ______________________________ And.... PENCE: What were dealing with is the  you know, theres an old proverb that says the Russian bear never dies, it just hibernates. And the truth of the matter is, the weak and feckless foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama has awakened an aggression in Russia that first appeared a few years ago with their move in Georgia, now their move into Crimea, now their move into the wider Middle East. And all the while, all we do is fold our arms and say were not having talks anymore. To answer your question, we just need American strength. We need to  we need to marshal the resources of our allies in the region, and in the immediate, we need to act and act now to get people out of harms way.

Donald Trump: 'Putin has eaten Obama's lunch' on Ukraine Mar 13, 2014

Eun Kyung Kim: TODAY Mar 13, 2014Eun Kyung Kim: TODAY Donald Trump slammed President Obama Thursday on TODAY for failing to take a stronger line against President Vladimir Putin in dealing with Ukraine, saying he feared Obama would now make up for lost time with imprudent moves to "show his manhood." The real estate mogul and reality-TV star, who has criticized Putin for sending military troops into Crimea, said Obama must now take fierce steps to prevent the situation from escalating further. "We should definitely do sanctions and we have to show some strengths. I mean, Putin has eaten Obama's lunch, therefore our lunch, for a long period of time," Trump said. ..." http://www.today.com/news/donald-trump-putin-has-eaten-obamas-lunch-ukraine-2D79372098

why are they not allowing food into besieged eastern Aleppo to alleviate our suffering Because you're a human shield. The most humanitarian thing to do is to let you move out of the warzone. Which is what Russia and Syria are attempting to do. That poses a quandary for the shills in the Western press. Their brainless narrative portrays Russia bombing innocent civilians for the sheer hell of it. But if Russia insists on letting the civilians go, then who is keeping the civilians in the Aleppo pocket? Answer: the White House and their allies, Al-Queda (rebranded since July as Fatah Al-Sham).

Q: Why does the USA arm the “rebels”? Answer: Because the “rebels” are al Qaeda

that bombed the Pentagon and murdered 3000 on 911.

However, the Pentagon serves Islamic terrorists, now

and supports slavers, rapists, and anyone

vowing the destroy America.
