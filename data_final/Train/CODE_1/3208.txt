Terrorists in Aleppo Losing Morale amid Army's Advance

TEHRAN (FNA)- Local sources said the terrorist groups in Aleppo have been demoralized as the army and its allies are advancing in the city.

According to the sources, the terrorists feel frightened after people hoisted Syrian flags in al-Halak Fauqani region in a show of support for the Damascus army and after the army approached western regions from the East and from Bostan Pasha region and started extensive detentions in the area.

Concurrent with the Syrian army's advance against the terrorist groups in the city of Aleppo, women of the Eastern districts of the city held protest rallies against the terrorist groups with the Syrian flags in their hands.

Local sources reported from Eastern Aleppo that women in al-Salehin, al-Marja, al-Ferdos and Bab al-Nayyer staged rallies to protest at the terrorists after the latter blocked the path of the civilian population who intended to escape to the army-controlled areas in Western and Eastern Aleppo through safe corridors.

The Syrian Army General Command announced on Wednesday that it will reduce airstrikes and shelling attacks on Eastern Aleppo to allow civilians to leave the city's besieged areas still controlled by militants groups.

"The command of the army made a decision to reduce the number of aerial and artillery strikes against terrorists' positions to help the civilians trapped in the city to leave for safer regions," the Syrian Army's statement said.

Aleppo has seen intense fighting over the past few months, with the Syrian army and popular forces managing to encircle large groups of militants in the Eastern districts of the city.

The Syrian army also said in order to prevent bloodshed and avoid more destruction, it gives militants in Aleppo’s Eastern neighborhoods an additional opportunity to benefit from amnesty decree and settle their status, or hand over their weapons and leave with their families.

The General command added in the statement that “We call on all gunmen in the Eastern neighborhoods not to wait for any assistance from any one as all supplying routes became cut off and there is no chance for them, but handing over their weapons.”
