ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines – A couple and their son were killed, while their two other children and a son of their employee were wounded in an attack by unidentified armed men in Sirawai town, Zamboanga del Norte on Friday night.

Rice mill operator Allan King Satera, his wife Florgyn and their 15-year-old son Michael died from several gunshot wounds, according to Chief Inspector Malahai Said, town police chief.

The couple and their son were found at the family-owned rice mill in Barangay San Vicente at past 6 p.m., along with their two other children – Mark Simon, 9, and Mike John, 5 – and two-year-old Hamja Lumina.

Lumina is a son of one of the slain couple’s employee.

The three children suffered gunshot wounds and were taken to the hospital for treatment.

Investigation showed Satera and his wife were tending to their rice mill when three armed men barged in and hacked and shot Allan King.

One of the men went to the cashier’s booth and shot Florgyn and the three children.

The assailants also shot and killed Michael, who arrived on a motorcycle as the armed men were about to leave.

Responding police officers recovered several bullet shells for a rifle and .45 caliber and .9mm pistols.

Said eyed extortion as the motive for the massacre.

He said Satera, a former soldier, and his wife were engaged in buy-and-sell of palay, aside from operating their own rice mill in Sirawai.
