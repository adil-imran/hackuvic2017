SRINAGAR: Jagmohan, who oversaw some of the worst massacres of Kashmiris during his brief spell in power at the beginning of the anti-India revolt in 1990, is probably the most-reviled governor ever deputed by New Delhi. The rule of another former governor, General KV Krishna Rao, who died today, was no less bloody.

A former army chief of India, Rao passed away at 93 on Saturday due to cardiac.

General Kotikalapudi Venkata Krishna Rao served J&K twice—from 11 July 1989 to 19 January 1990 and 13 March 1993 to 2 May 1998.

According to Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society, Rao’s second tenure witnessed 10 massacres:

10 April 1993: BSF kill 10 civilians and injured one

10 April 1993: BSF kill 6 civilians, injure 3

26 June 1993: ITBP kill four inmates in Jammu jail, injure 13
