Paul Ryan tells House GOP he won't defend Trump in wake of video scandal

Posted on by DOC44

House Speaker Paul Ryan told fellow Republican lawmakers Monday he will not defend Donald Trump and will focus only on maintaining GOP control of both houses of Congress.

But the House speaker has not pulled his endorsement of Trump, a Ryan spokeswoman told NBC News. "The speaker is going to spend the next month focused entirely on protecting our congressional majorities," she said. Ryan hinted that he may think the presidential race is out of reach for Trump, telling lawmakers on a call that he wants to ensure Democrat Hillary Clinton does not get a blank check with Congress, according to NBC News. He said representatives need to do what is best in their districts.

Gutless weasel wants to keep his job, please Romney but yet won't put himself all in the anti-Trump mode just incase Trump wins.



To: DOC44

Don’t worry when Trump wins he will deal with Ryan.



To: LoveMyFreedom

And if Trump doesn’t win, we will deal with him.

Wonder what kind of skeletons lurk in his closet -— hypocrites are often the most sanctimonious!!!



To: DOC44

Ryan wants to run in 4 years.

He hasn’t been helping before now, so

his announcement of it means nothing.



To: DOC44

Should have shut up long ago.

He’s never done anything but cause Trump trouble.

Tell you R Congressman what you think of anyone who’d vote the fool Speaker.

“he wants to ensure Democrat Hillary Clinton does not get a blank check with Congress, according to NBC News. “ Didn’t stop him from giving Obama a blank check.

Ryan has does nothing of substance as speaker, so I don’t think his support is important. He has marginalized himself and is of no consequence.



To: DOC44

I hope the voters of his district figure out that a freshman Democrat in a D jersey is less harmful than a turncoat Speaker Democrat in an R jersey.

Trump has been running an independent campaign for President from within the Republican Party from the beginning. Ryan’s attitude is just par for the course.

Ryan knows what the dems are planning for Trump. Trump needs to go all out against Clinton’s lies, Clinton’s rapes, etc. NOW.

Does Ryan really think Trump needs him??? When Trump wants a whiney weasel, he knows where he can find Ryan. It would be great if this would cost Ryan his seat, but WI voters are too dense to Cantorize him.



To: DOC44

FUPR and the rest of your RINO buddies!



To: DOC44

This is pure sabotage. After Trumps performance last night, that put the Clintons on their heels, this puke ruins it all. Instead of the narrative being Trump resets race, it’s now the lead story all night that Trump s being left for dead and race us over. Total sleazeball.

What’s maddening is that this turncoat KNOWS perfectly well that the media has hours of tape of Hillary and Obama in off the record sessions that are likely a million times worse then what Trump said. But they would never in a million years release them. Ryan KNOWS this. He’s a turncoat. A traitor. An establishment tool.



To: DouglasKC

Paul Ryan is 50x worse than Boehner was. At least with Boehner I felt he was being blackmailed and didn’t want to do what he was doing. But Ryan seems to do whatever he needs to just to be and stay in power.

What chance does he have against an incumbent Hillary if Trump loses? Sounds pretty stupid to me.



To: DOC44



This is not news. Ryan, and the rest of the Republican establishment, have



NEVER



defended anybody against liberal assault.

**Paul Ryan tells House GOP he won’t defend Trump in wake of** “words spoken 11 years ago, and which ryan knows full well that is no scandal.. the real scandal is ryan letting obama do all he did and ryan not representing the people.. but himself.. the scandal in washington is the corrupt congress and president...and media God help this broken nation!



To: DOC44

Everyone voted for that bastard RAT Romney

even after he savaged Gov. Palin and her children

to throw the election to Soros-Obama. And in return the skunk RAT Romney threw the

next election. THAT was not enough for the RAT Romney who now

sours the election to murder a free People, if he can.

Ryan wants to run in 4 years.



He's dreaming if that's the case. If Hillary wins, no Republican will ever win a national election again. A few years after that, Republicans will only be able to win in a very small number of Congressional districts in the most rural states. But even that will be irrelevant. American governance will be completely dominated by Federal policy, regulation, and law. Governors, state legislatures, mayors, etc., will have no power. That's America's future. The Democrats know it.

Dump him as Speaker-—

.. this puke ruins it all 98% of the voting population will neither know about this nor care about Ryan. /.02

I would lover to have take on the leaders of the GOP establishment. I am sure they have plenty of skeletons in their closets with what they have said and done, yet all are acting holier than though. We know better. Most politicians are power hungry scum that believes they are above the rules and their ambition leads them to many heinous acts. But right, act all self-righteous over some locker room talk by a business man. I would love to see the establishments tapes released if they had them.

To: RickGee

I don’t think he really wants to run for the White House in 2020. The House speaker is usually not well positioned for that. If he runs for the governor’s office first, then maybe he’s a future contender in 2024 or later.

There is a difference between being misunderstanding the voters (understandable), and just being scared/wimpy/weasely/corrupt. Unfortunately, I think that the repub leaders are the latter.



To: All

Heard on Cernovich that the RNC is denying funds to the Trump campaign...funds he helped raise. RNC is inserting moles, purging Trump loyalists, and attempting to sabotage his campaign. ‏@Cernovich

“breaking former advisor to @MittRomney and @SpeakerRyan,

@dansenor leaked @realDonaldTrump tapes????!!!!” WTF. I am hoping this is completely wrong. Looking at Wikipedia - his father died at the Auschwitz concentration camp. I don’t understand the lack of integrity to do something like this. Especially since HC will always side with Arabs against the Jews.

That’s something that I believe to be true also.

Delusional about his own worth . He has done NOTHING to stop Obama’s agenda and helping the enemy.

Ryan got money from the pedophile Hastert. Didn’t send it back. Come to think of it, Ryan has a face that looks like it belongs on a poster for a level four sex offender.

Maybe if Romney and Ryan hadn’t run such a milquetoast campaign he wouldn’t have to be talking about Trump.

The feckless coward Ryan has no problem with the Clintons raping and terrorizing women and children but he’s backing away from Trump because of something he said 11 years ago before he became a Christian. What a low-life coward.

The Inside Story of How the GOP Sabotaged Trumps Voter Registration Drive October 9, 2016 By Mike Cernovich Donald Trumps get out the vote efforts have been sabotaged at every level by the GOP, sources report exclusively to this reporter. Some of the sabotage is obvious and clear, and others is more subtle.

True. And the GOPe is quite content with being a minority Party, since the Democrats are doing what they want to do as well.

You don't understand. If Hillary wins, there won't be a GOPe or a GOP-anything, even as a minority party, in 20 years. America will be a multi-racial multi-cultural South American style craphole. But there will still be politics: It'll be the Asian Democrats fighting the Hispanic Democrats. And there will be the Black Democrats vs. the Muslim Democrats.

The Never Trumpers and GOPe better put aside their bold ambitions to "restore the Party." America will have permanent Democrat rule if Hillary wins and she opens the immigration floodgates.





To: DOC44

Considering he & his “advisors” are responsible for it in the first place, according to latest reports, this is no surprise at all. Most likely planned all along.
