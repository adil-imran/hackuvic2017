LOOK: Australia lit up with love for Orlando

Beautiful tributes to the victims of the Orlando massacre lit up in many Australian cities yesterday, shining thousands of candlelights and huge rainbow colours to remember those lost.

The events began with a vigil in Melbourne’s Fitzroy. Hundreds gathered at very short notice. “We are family, we need to take care of each other,” was a key message. “Remain calm, be brave and keep your heads held high.”

Then in the evening, Melbourne’s Town Hall was lit rainbow.

Meanwhile in Sydney, the rainbow flag was flying at half-mast from the Town Hall in the afternoon. As the sun set, the grand old building in the heart of the city glowed pink.

Sydney’s in the middle of the vibrant VIVID Festival, so it was easy to paint the Harbour Bridge in rainbow light. New South Wales Premier Mike Baird tweeted a stunning image of it.

Sydneysiders held two vigils in its two main LGBTI hubs – Oxford Street’s Taylor Square and Newtown. Taylor Square’s event was a busy gathering filled with candlelights and rainbows. Newtown’s vigil featured several speakers paying tribute to those lost, and rallying for an end to homophobia.
