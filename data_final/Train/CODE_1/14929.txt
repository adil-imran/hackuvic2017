(Adds quotes, detail) LONDON, Feb 10 ( Reuters ) – The Saudi-backed opponents of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Wednesday called on the United States to act more forcefully to stop Russia’s bombing of their positions.

Riad Hijab, a former Syrian prime minister who heads an opposition council backed by Saudi Arabia, said talks could only take place if sieges were lifted, humanitarian assistance arrived and Russian Federation halted air strikes. And we were there to really make it a success but we do not have a serious partner.

The Syrian Kurdish Peoples Protection Units (YPG) have made advances at the expense of Syrian opposition groups in the country’s north amidst continued Russian aerial bombardments being carried out in support of a major Syrian offensive aimed at routing out the rebels from that important part of the country. “The Syrian regime, Russian Federation and Iran don’t see anyone who says “no” to them and that is why they commit more massacres in Syria”.

After agreeing in November a road map for a ceasefire, U.N.-brokered talks between the government and opposition, and eventual elections, the ISSG has been unable to move ahead with peace talks.

Jordan had been assigned the task of drawing up the list and collected proposals from members of the group.

“Zarif suggested that Iran might propose including the Central Intelligence Agency as well”, a Western diplomat said.

The situation in Syria would be better if Russian Federation stopped bombing opposition groups, civilians and civilian infrastructure, a US spokesman said Tuesday. “There are some countries that it seems don’t want peace to be restored in Syria”, a senior official involved in the Syria talks said. “It is a great mistake to say that we will have them (allies) or that we don’t have any”, Zakharova said. “We are studying this issue”, she noted.
