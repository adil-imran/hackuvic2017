Baku, Azerbaijan, Feb. 4

By Rufiz Hafizoglu - Trend:

Iran and Russia are involved in civilian deaths in Syria, the Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said, TRT Haber TV channel reported Feb. 4.

Russia's military actions in Syria have aggravated the problem in that country, said Davutoglu.

He also noted that Russia's air forces mostly bomb opposition's positions, rather than the positions of the militants of the "Islamic State" terrorist organization (IS, ISIL, ISIS, or Daesh).

Russia by supporting the Syrian regime commits ethnic cleansing in Syria, including in Aleppo, according to Davutoglu.

He also said international community doesn't make any efforts to stop the crisis in Syria.

Currently, there are still 10,000 refugees at the border, who intend to enter Turkey, and this is due to the military actions in the Syrian city of Aleppo, according to him.

Turkey hosts over two million Syrian refugees on its territory. The Syrian refugee camps in the country accommodate about 300,000 people.

In Istanbul alone, there are currently 40,000 refugees from Syria. Ankara has so far spent $8 billion to upkeep the Syrian refugees.
