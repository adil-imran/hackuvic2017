Ten Years, and Slightly Less Alone ... Mark Steyn

Steyn Onlne ^ | 11 Oct 2016 | Mark Steyn

Posted on by Rummyfan

Ten years ago this coming weekend - October 16th 2006 - my book America Alone: The End of the World as We Know It hit the bookstores and shortly thereafter the bestseller lists. This paragraph from early in the Prologue lays out the thesis:

Much of what we loosely call the western world will not survive this century, and much of it will effectively disappear within our lifetimes, including many if not most European countries. There'll probably still be a geographical area on the map marked as Italy or the Netherlands - probably - just as in Istanbul there's still a building known as Hagia Sophia, or St Sophia's Cathedral. But it's not a cathedral; it's merely a designation for a piece of real estate. Likewise, Italy and the Netherlands will merely be designations for real estate.

That's just for starters. And, unlike the ecochondriacs' obsession with rising sea levels, this isn't something that might possibly conceivably hypothetically threaten the Maldive Islands circa the year 2500; the process is already well advanced as we speak. With respect to Francis Fukuyama, it's not the end of history, it's the end of the world - as we know it.

Quite a read detailing how far the west has fallen, and Islam has ascended.

Steyn is consistently spot on prescient, and we can’t say he didn’t warn us: “And yet that world is utterly altered.

Just to recap those bald statistics: In 1970, the developed nations had twice as big a share of the global population as the Muslim world: 30 per cent to 15 per cent. By 2000, they were at parity: each had about 20 per cent. And by 2020...? Well, by 2020, it will be impossible to compare statistics between “the Muslim world” and the west - because Islam is currently responsible for most population growth in English, French and German cities, and the principal supplier of immigrants to Canada, and already 25 per cent of the population of the European Union’s capital city, Brussels. Ten years ago, my line about mediation between Islam and the “host community” being the “principal political dynamic” in western Europe also struck many as “alarmist”, but after this last summer in Germany and France and Sweden it’s inarguable: September 11th 2001 was not “the day everything changed”, but the day that revealed how much had already changed. On September 10th, how many journalists had the Council of American-Islamic Relations or the Canadian Islamic Congress or the Muslim Council of Britain in their rolodexes? If you’d said that whether something does or does not cause offence to Muslims would be the early 21st century’s principal political dynamic in Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, France and the United Kingdom, most folks would have thought you were crazy. Yet on that Tuesday morning the top of the iceberg bobbed up and toppled the Twin Towers.”

My girl friend is not very political, but when she sees Steyn as a guest on Fox, she usually says something like, “Now, there’s a sane man. There aren’t many left.” She especially likes Steyn’s humor in the face of potential catastrophe, and his lack of PC. She saw PC up close and personal in the academic world, and it drove her to an early retirement from the teaching profession.

And there is nothing anyone can do to stop this trend. It is a historical certainty that the center of civilization is slowly, inexorably, moving East towards China - a rising power that is still committed to self-preservation, and away from the opulent, decadent, collapsing West that is slowly being engulfed by barbarism ... and we in the US are now under the exact same assault that began in Europe a generation ago ... elections may slow things down (or spped it up, as they did in 2008 and 2012), but the Western elites are now simply morally incapable of seeing Islam for what it is - a mortal threat to their entire way of life, a more primitive totalitarian philosophy akin in many ways to Naziism, cloaked under the magically (in the West) “protective label” of religion ... As has happened throguhout history, civilization has entered a period of sharp decline, from which no society has ever recovered .. a new dark ages is descending on Europe, and is beginning to threaten the Western Hemisphere ... the generation that beat Hitler would be disgusted at their grandchildren ...

Need to get my Batman dictionary out now...

He doesn’t say in the article why we’re slightly less alone...



To: Rummyfan

Got his book at the time, he nailed most of it.

Because we are more of a part of now, we are losing the ability to be the last best hope. We have some advantages that the rest of world does not, these however, are being slowly taken from us. We are letting them. The 2nd amendment is the key, if it can be diluted then they can do what they want with impunity. Pray for guidance.

Well, for one thing, the Republican presidential nominee has made opposing unrestricted Muslim immigration a top priority. He has spoken of the threat in an unprecedented way for an American politician, and he has millions of followers. This is something new.

Steyn was a righteous prophet when he wrote America Alone. I read it then, and am rereading it today because of the column. Unfortunately, I sent my two kids copies some time ago and they gave up reading it because it was too difficult for them and they didn’t get the jokes/satire.
