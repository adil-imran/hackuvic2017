A massive manhunt is underway in Brussels after a series of bombings struck the Zaventem airport and a metro train on Tuesday. So far about 35 people have been killed. Belgian police are hunting for a suspect caught on airport closed-circuit cameras, walking beside two other suspects.

A massive manhunt is underway-as Belgian police hunt for this man. He was caught on an airport closed circuit security camera this morning, walking beside two other suspects. Moments later two bombs exploded. The third failed to detonate. There were scenes of chaos as passengers fled in panic through dust and debris. Witnesses say it was like a "scene from a war."

An hour later-another explosion ripped through a metro train in the center of Brussels. The Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility for the attacks. Europe has been bracing itself for an attack like this for weeks.

In the coming days there will be questions-mainly, how did security officials fail to prevent this attack?

The attacks come just days after the only surviving fugitive from the Paris massacres - Salah Abdeslam - was arrested here in Brussels. He reportedly told investigators over the weekend that he was planning fresh attacks and authorities here now fear they may be yet more to come.
