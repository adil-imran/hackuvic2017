PIKETON, Ohio (WDTN) — Attorney General Mike DeWine is vowing the Pike County murders will be solved as he is turning to the public and businesses for help.

He’s asking anyone with any relevant surveillance video from April 21 and 22 to come forward. This includes residents and businesses nearby that may have a view of the road that could have captured any cars driving through the area.

In a news conference Tuesday, Attorney General Mike DeWine said he told the public from the beginning that this could be a very long investigation. Even though they’ve received hundreds of tips, he said it’s going to take a while to put all of the pieces of the puzzle together.

Eight members of the Rhoden family were shot to death execution-style at four locations in Pike County on April 22.

Marijuana grow operations were found at three of the crime scenes, which has caused some to speculate that the killings may be drug-related.

Police have interviewed hundreds of witnesses and collected dozens of items of evidence, but still no arrests.

DeWine said he’s not discouraged by what appears to be a lack of leads and vows to find whoever did this.

“It will be solved. It’s a slow process, a methodical process,” admitted DeWine. “The nature of cases like this, we don’t have witnesses, you only have a body — or in this case eight bodies. By it’s very nature, they take a while.”

Officials have received more than 500 tips.

Right now, the scenes where those murders happened are still blocked off with no one allowed on the property, including the surviving Rhoden family.

Any one with surveillance video is asked to call the BCI tip line or Pike County Sheriff’s Office.
