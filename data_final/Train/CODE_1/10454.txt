Human rights organization, Amnesty International (AI) has urged the Nigerian military to confess its role in the December 2015 massacre of Shiite Muslims after the Kaduna State Government revealed that 347 corpses were buried in a mass grave after a battle between the army and the group in Zaria.

AI made the call on Tuesday, April 12, 2016, through its Country Director in Nigeria, M.K. Ibrahim.

“The horrific revelation by the Kaduna State government that hundreds of Shi’ites were gunned down and dumped in mass graves is an important first step to bringing all those suspected of criminal responsibility for this atrocity to trial,” Ibrahim said.

“It is now imperative that the mass grave sites are protected in order that a full independent forensic investigation can begin. The bodies must be exhumed and Nigerian authorities should immediately reveal the whereabouts of those held in unacknowledged detention and either charge or release them,” he added.

Details of the mass burial were provided by Secretary to the Kaduna State Government, Balarabe Lawal on Monday, April 11.

The Shiites and the army clashed after members of the group allegedly attempted to assassinate Chief of Army Staff, Tukur Buratai.
