In a blow to the family and friends of Philando Castile, the officer who is responsible for his death is returning to work.Last month, in shocking video streamed on Facebook Live , Philando Castile, 32, is seen bleeding to death after a Minnesota police officer shot him through his driver-side car window. His girlfriend, Lavish Reynolds captured the horrific scene on her cell phone, narrating the tragic events and streaming them live on Facebook.According to Reynolds, police pulled them over for a broken tail light and callously shot her Castile to death after he told the officers that he had a firearm and a conceal-and-carry permit. Reynold's 4-year-old daughter was reportedly sitting in the back seat when the officer fired at least four bullets into Castile's arm and chest.Now, only a month after the death of this beloved member of the community, the cop who sent him to an early grave,As reported by the AP, Yanez was expected to return to work for the first time Wednesday, Chief Jon Mangseth said.Mangseth wouldn't discuss any details of the shooting, and would not say whether or not he thinks Yanez should be exonerated.In Castile's girlfriend's video, Yanez is yelling expletives and pointing his gun at Castile as he lies bleeding in the driver's seat of the car — sounds like he has an amazing sense of "communicating and relating to people.""There's been no time in my career where we've ever had this type of dynamic at work, this national stage, so to speak," said Mangseth, who joined the department in 1995 and took over as chief earlier this year.According to the AP, that scrutiny eventually revealed Mangseth's department has disproportionately arrested African Americans.according to an AP analysis of arrest data provided by the department. Members of Minnesota's black community said theAs the Free Thought Project reported last month, Castile was a ticking time bomb — because of law enforcement policy in the United States.Prior to being pulled over and murdered by Yanez,According to the Post, Castile was assessed at least $6,588 in fines and fees, although more than half of the totalcourt records show.Not only was he not a criminal,"He's concerned for his future and for his family," the chief said of Yanez. "This has put him and his family front and center in our metro area, not to mention the nation."
