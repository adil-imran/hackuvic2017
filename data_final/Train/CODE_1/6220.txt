Analysis

Events in Srebrenica and the recent controversial referendum have been like salt in the wounds for many Bosniaks living in Bosnia's Serb-dominated entity.

The possible election of a Serb as mayor of the blighted town of Srebrenica, scene of the worst massacre of the 1992-5 war in Bosnia, has added insult to injury, as far as Bosniaks living in the Serb-dominated entity of Republika Srpska, are concerned.

It comes days after the voters in the entity opted to keep the disputed entity National Day on January 9, despite Bosniak objections and rulings by local and international authorities.

Bosniaks in Republika Srpska say that the two events, only a week apart, more than two decades after the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement halted the war, have convinced them that they are still struggling in vain for equality in the entity.
