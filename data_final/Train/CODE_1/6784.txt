Bodo militant wanted by NIA killed in shootout

A Bodo militant -- who was wanted by the NIA for his involvement in the December 2014 massacre of Adivasi people -- was on Monday shot dead by security forces in Assam's Chirang district, officials said.

Uday Narzary alias Khilikhang of the anti-talk faction of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) was killed by a joint team of the Indian Army and Police.

He was wanted by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for his involvement in the December 2014 massacre of Adivasis.

Based on inputs, a joint team of army and police launched an operation in Edenbari village in Chirang district in the early hours of Monday, Guwahati-based defence spokesman Lt. Col. Suneet Newton said.

On being challenged by the security forces, the militant fired at them with an automatic weapon.

The security forces retaliated, injuring the militant.

He was taken to the district hospital in Chirang, where he was declared dead, on Monday.

An AK-56 rifle, some ammunition and Rs.31,000 in cash were recovered from the slaim militant, the official said.

In December 2014, NDFB militants had unleashed mayhem in the state's Kokrajhar, Chirang and Sonitpur districts killing at least 70 people.
