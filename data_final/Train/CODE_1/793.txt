Watch out for these new telephone scams to steal your money

Daily Breeze ^ | Aug. 21, 2016 | Larry Altman,

Posted on by Innovative

They are extremely persistent and claiming to be the IRS and threatening to throw you in jail and all kinds of things, the 76-year-old Torrance resident said. They try to make it sound official.

In the past month, the IRS and several South Bay police agencies have issued public warnings about the IRS scam and similar cons perpetrated by thieves on the telephone.

You are never going to get a call from the IRS demanding an immediate tax payment, IRS spokesman Raphael Tulino said. A lot of folks will hear its the IRS and act out of panic or dismay, and provide what the scammer wants. The normal correspondence to the taxpayer is a letter in the mail. Its not a random threatening phone call.

Best thing is to hang up on these people. There really is a lot of this going on.



To: Innovative

I’ve gotten a call a few times from those jack wagons.



To: Innovative

If it’s on the internet, in an email or on your phone, it’s a scam. Tell them to send you a letter through the U.S. Mail and hang up. It’s not rocket science.

Best thing is to keep them on the line and feed them BS. If you have the time and inclination. I had one on the line last week for 20 minutes while I was running through FR.

< Ive gotten a call a few times from those jack wagons. Same here. I told them to send their agents to my house but they never showed up



To: Innovative

most come from India. We should cut inncoming calls from these craphole countries until they crackdown.



To: Innovative

Tag their phone number they’re calling from? Do a reverse call after they hang up to see where it goes then report it?

You mean the IRS doesn't accept payments in GameStop gift cards? Wish I had known this earlier.



To: Innovative

I can do a great Indian accent.

I love to talk to these guys. I think they are in Europe or some former USSR country.

Don’t mess with retirees, LOL.



To: SkyDancer

They spoof the caller id, very easy to do.

The key thing is never do business or discuss anything with anyone WHO CALLS YOU. Beware of all incoming calls. .



To: Old Yeller

Got one the other day. Hung up laughing at them. Next time I’ll have to try to contain myself long enough to ask if they are related to the Nigerian prince.

To: Old Yeller

Me too. I never answer any number that I dont know. For the pAST YEAR, the message always ends in “May God have mercy on your soul.” after the “ we will take away your money blah blah” The IRS is full of godless heathens so I knew it was a scam s/

First thing, the Internal Revenue Service never refers to themselves as the IRS.

How?



To: SkyDancer

They are good at faking caller ID.

The ones I get say “IRS ENFORCEMENT” and have a 202 area code. Love to chat with them using my fake Indian accent.

Tell the “iRS” you have Bitcoins and McDonald’s monopoly cards.

Guess the first question to ask the caller is to give you your personal details; SS# to start with. Since the warning has been out there a while maybe people will do a reverse scam on them. Be fun to see if someone could record one of those calls.

I get at least once a week the call informing me I got a free government grant of $8,000... I say, "Wow... that's fantastic, please send the check to my home address" Then they try and get my banking information since it will be faster that way... "That's OK, just send the check"... Click...

To: nascarnation

Interesting. So do you sound like an Indian Help Desk consultant? Maybe you can tell them there seems to be something wrong with their phone connection since it’s dumping all sorts of stuff into your computer.

The IRS is full of godless heathens... That's why it's called the "Infernal Revenue Service".

I get almost daily (or more) calls from India claiming to be from Microsoft Windows Technical Support. I tell them my windows are nice and clean and I see out of them just fine. They always get mad and hang up.

To: Wilderness Conservative

We should cut inncoming calls from these craphole countries until they crackdown. They are not calling long distance and cannot be cut off, they VOIP though a gateway.

I got a call last week from a guy with a Caribbean accent who said I had won a trip on a Caribbean cruise ship. All he needed to confirm my trip was my credit card number...



To: mad_as_he$$

I tell them To call back Tuesday and Ill think about it then.

Happened to me here in Tx several times this year. One of the ‘IRS lawsuit calls’ was sent from a Seattle area code phone #. Yeh, right.. GTH scam artists.



To: Thibodeaux

As you read the numbers, throw them for a loop. “One...four....nine....teen”



To: Innovative

Yup I’ve been getting these calls for quite a while. They are robo-calls saying “ Final notice the IRS has filed suit against you, call this number now blah blah blah” etc. We get them almost every day sometimes twice or more. I always hang up and have always known from the very first call that they were trying to scam us. The IRS doesn’t conduct business that way. They know where I live and if they want to contact me for any reason it would be through the mail.

They can VOIP through a gateway to landlines or mobile networks. There are free ones out there.

To: Innovative; All

My area code gets a lot of these. Tip #2 works very well! 1. I usually let answering machine screen—I get annoyed with the disruptions...My friends and family have my cell number. 2. If you want to answer, pick up the handset and wait a couple seconds before saying “Hello,” most robo-calls will have disconnected because they don’t hear a voice to activate the call.

To: palmer

“They can VOIP through a gateway to landlines or mobile networks.” Isn’t there any way to track them down?



by 34 posted onby dsc (Any attempt to move a government to the left is a crime against humanity.)

To: mad_as_he$$

Yeah, I’ve thought about doing that but remember, your number’s in there database and they are all called by a computer program “robo-call” system. So, even if you waste their time, the calls will persist and if the guy wants to get back at you for that he can probably increase them just to bug you. It’s probably just best to hang up and report them.

To: Mears

The key thing is never do business or discuss anything with anyone WHO CALLS YOU. That is my exact handling of anyone who calls trying to sell me anything.

I play crazy old grouchy 90 year lady ..it seems to stop their calls. is mr x there. I Launch into something like..he is In the hen house trying to figure out who stole the chicken eggs. I think it is the fox but he thinks its the neighbor..by about that time they hang up.

So you’re telling me that the offer of $900,000 I received today on my email which I will receive - tax free - if I send them my full name, address, date of birth, place of employment and valid credit card # only via Western Union is a SCAM? Surely you jest. /s/

We never answer the phone. Even if we’re right beside it. We let the little Chinese Robot answer it. These A-Holes from “I.R.S. Services” call us at least twice a week leaving a message claiming they are going to sue us. We just ignore them.

I got 2 calls from the scammers on Friday afternoon/evening.

It was an 800 number, when called back, just rang and rang.

THE IRS NEVER CALLS OR EMAILS.

If the IRS were NOT a terrorist organization, these scams wouldn’t work.



To: Innovative

This is Special Agent Roberts, FBI. We have been tracking these calls for two months and have a warrant for you and your team's arrest. A an armed team is on its way to your office right now. Please remain where you are and do not resist when they arrive. If you resist, the team has orders to shoot to kill. Alternately, if you don't mind getting a visit from the FBI yourself - There is a bomb in your office set to go off in 90 seconds. If you leave now you will survive.

I ask for a number to call them back and then report it to the Kansas Atty Gen



To: dsc

Not really. If a VOIP gateway looked at incoming addresses, all the perps would have to do is rent a server in the US and relay through that.

Next, I'll find out that those emails I've been getting about all of those gorgeous 21 year old Asian women who are anxious to meet me isn't legitimate, either.



To: Innovative

That’s not new, they’ve been calling us for months. I hang up on them, but my husband likes to play with his food.

To: Innovative

We’ve gotten calls from them before. I ignore them. For that matter, I’ve decided against answering the phone at all unless I recognize the number or caller from caller ID. If I don’t know you, I don’t want to talk to you.
