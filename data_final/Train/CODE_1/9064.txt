Italian SpondaSud referring to the military hostilities unleashed on Nagorno Karabakh by Azerbaijan, in a number of publications, noted that Azerbaijan recruited IS fighters from Syria and Iraq to fight against Armenians.



“Azerbaijani soldiers see no difference between soldiers and civilians. Indeed the extreme cruelty Baku militants apply against Armenian civilians reminds about the events of Syria and Iraq,” the newspaper writes.



As a proof SpondaSud cites the murder of an elderly family and the deformation of their bodies in Talysh village, Nagorno Karabakh.



The agency writes that the international community is used to seeing this kind of crimes against civilians committed only by IS terrorists.



According to SpondaSud, the similarity gives ground to believe that Azerbaijan recruited IS fighters to realize ethnic cleansing of Armenians in Nagorno Karabakh.



In addition to Talysh atrocities, the agency also described in detail Kyaram Sloyan’s beheading by Azerbaijani soldiers.
