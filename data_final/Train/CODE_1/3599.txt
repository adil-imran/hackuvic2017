Melissa George looked sombre as she left a Paris court on Thursday after her partner Jean David Blanc appeared on charges of domestic assault against her.

Blanc made his appearance amid reports that the Australian actress was taken to hospital last month following the alleged assault.

He denied the charges against him, according to a report in French newspaper Le Parisien.

The Australian actress, 40, wore a white maxi dress and ballet flats, along with a tan sweater over her shoulders as she descended the steps, accompanied by friends.

Jean David left separately, wearing dark blue trousers and a warm winter coat.

Last month, the actress was reportedly taken to Cochin hospital hospitalised following the alleged assault by her partner of four years.

According to French website Purepeople, Melissa, received medical treatment after turning up at the police station at around 3am on Wednesday morning.

The star - who shares two sons with 48-year-old Jean David - was allegedly suffering from bruising to her face and complaining of pain and feeling faint.
