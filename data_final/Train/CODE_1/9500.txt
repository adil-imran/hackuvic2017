• I READ with interest Labour Assembly Member Murad Qureshi’s Forum piece (Laundered money skews property market, West End Extra, April 22).

Is central London being depopulated?

Where will the eight million-odd Londoners who aren’t multi-millionaires go?

Westminster Council certainly seems to have vast tracts of land at its disposal in places like Dagenham, and seem very keen on shipping everybody bar billionaires out there. And, of course, some of us are old enough to know that there is nothing new about gerrymandering and ethnic cleansing.

Will central London become a vacant, bland corporate jungle of soulless glass and steel owned by a handful of property speculators?

Nobody in. Perhaps the smart money is already getting out of London and preparing for the rape and pillage of somewhere else…
