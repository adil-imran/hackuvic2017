Merima was born and raised in Bosnia-Herzegovina (former Yugoslavia). Sudden nationalistic divide in the early nineties, leads to a bloody war where a third of Bosnian population (mainly Muslims) is killed. Merima and her family escape ethnic cleansing in Banjaluka (where she was born) and settle in Travnik where they stay until the Dayton peace agreement is signed. Merimaâ€™s passion for writing starts in high school and continues throughout her life as a hobby. She moved to the USA in 1999 to study engineering and mathematics, her "other love". She now lives in Connecticut and is married and has two boys. As a mother, a refugee, an engineer and a woman, Merima is passionate about the world issues and strives to speak about social injustices as seen from her multiple perspectives. She writes and blogs about social issues, politics and her interests on her website www.worldaccordingtoblam.com. She also writes poetry and short stories and she is eagerly awaiting her first publication of two short stories and two poems in a collection of prose and poetry with other fellow authors from Connecticut which will be complete in the next couple of months.
