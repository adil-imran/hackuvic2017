And in another court, a 36- year-old man of Lusaka appeared in the Lusaka Magistrates court for an explanation of his charge.

Alex Kawina , a Crane Operator appeared before Chief Residence Magistrate Aridah Chulu after he was arrested and charged for aggravated robbery contrary to the laws of Zambia.
