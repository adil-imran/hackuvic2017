He found the camps by analysing current and historic satellite images of the 1,330 sq km national park.

"What look like buildings on the satellite images are not in fact buildings, but giant racks where children who have been enslaved have been doing the drying and cleaning and scraping," he said.

Three areas of the Sundarbans Reserve Forest are certified as World Heritage Sites by Unesco, an arm of the United Nations.

Unesco did not respond to requests for comment, but said it leaves the management of protected areas to local governments.

Makeshift fish drying camps are permitted in the Sundarbans park during certain months of the year and local authorities are not aware of any malpractices, officials said.

Zahir Uddin Ahmed, the Bangladeshi Conservator of Forests, said: "We have no specific allegations on forced labour."

Pankaj Chandra Roy, the district police chief for Bagerhat, the area in which most of the park is located, said he was not aware of the recent satellite images, but acknowledged that there were a number of fish drying camps in the Sundarbans.

He added: "If we receive any allegation from any parents, we are ready to conduct a drive against the particular location inside Sundarbans."
