Police are advising people ignore the fake stories on Facebook about an apparent massacre in New Zealand.



The story outlines an incident which left; "11 dead and many injured" is fake.

“We are aware of a number of posts which has the same information about an apparent incident, but references different New Zealand cities,” says NZ Police communications staff.

“These posts also seem to reference notable media outlets in the title in an effort to give it some legitimacy.”

Police are advising the public to ignore these posts, not share them further, and delete them from their news feed.

The post from newsglobalsharing centre headlines ‘11 dead many injured in Wellington' and purports to be a New Zealand Herald story. It's not.

The New Zealand city involved rotates. Earlier this week it was Wellington, yesterday it was Christchurch and it also rotates Hamilton.
