CAIRO- The Arab League Council, at the level of permanent delegates, condemned, Wednesday in Cairo, the massacres, acts of destructions and attacks targeting Syrian cities.

In a final statement at the end of its ordinary meeting on Syria, the Arab League Council called for "bringing all those, who participated in the brutal attacks against innocent civilians in Aleppo and other Syrian cities, to international justice."

It also condemned "all terrorist organizations and groups such as "Daesh" for their terrorist acts and crimes against Syrian civilians in Aleppo and other Syrian cities."

Algeria condemned, through its ambassador and permanent delegate to the Arab League Nadhir Larbaoui, the violence and acts of destruction targeting Syrian cities.

"We are following today with deep concern the escalation of military operations in Aleppo and other Syrian cities. The attacks and massacres in Syria, broadcast by the media, are contrary to all religions and the international charter, which call for the respect for human life and the preservation of people's right to a decent and peaceful life."

Larbaoui underlined the need for "an objective assessment of the situation in Aleppo and other Syrian cities," adding that "terrorism represents a genuine threat to the security and stability in Syria and in the entire region."

"Algeria has repeatedly warned, since the beginning of the crisis, against the impacts of terrorism on peace and stability and has also called for dialogue and reconciliation between Syrians in order to overcome the differences and find peaceful political solutions, which would allow Syrian people preserve their sovereignty, independence and the territorial unity of their country, away from any foreign interference," he added.
