Hundreds of mourners have stood together hand-in-hand at a tribute in Brussels, remembering the victims in the wake of Tuesday's tragic terror attacks.

Poignant video footage shows the tearful strangers embracing each other in a show of solidarity, to mourn the 34 casualties of the blasts.

Describing the scenes, British Twitter user Francesca Nightingale wrote: "The resilience of the human spirit is amazing. About 300-400 people around the memorial in Brussels. They're not scared, they're united."
