It is a place of collective grief and remembrance, where the exhibits are fragments of wreckage and the debris of destruction.

Most moving are the memorial fountains that occupy the footprint of the original buildings. Unlike most other fountains, though, here the water flows down and disappears into a black hole, an abyss. The intention was to symbolise lives lost that can never be recovered. No matter how much water flows, the emptiness is never filled.

After the tragedies of the past few weeks the memorial has another message also: it is that the violence never ends; innocent blood continues to flow.

Asad Shah, a 40-year-old shopkeeper in Glasgow, was a deeply loved man who represented all that is good in religious faith. His crime was to wish his Christian friends and customers a happy Easter. He was murdered, it seems, not just to silence him but to intimidate others who might have followed him on the path to religious tolerance. One must not forget that, of the hundreds of Muslims murdered daily, the majority die at the hands of fellow Muslims.

The suicide bombings in Lahore are part of a pattern in which Christians have been terrorised across an ever-widening swathe of countries across the world.

Christians are being persecuted in about 50 countries, among them North Korea, Syria, Somalia and Sudan. In 2003 there were 1.5million Christians in Iraq; today a few thousand. In Mosul, one of the oldest Christian communities in the world, Christians were forced to flee by Islamic State in 2014. In Afghanistan the last church was burned to the ground in 2010. In Gaza in 2007, after the rise of Hamas, the last Christian bookshop was destroyed and its owner murdered. In Yemen, on Good Friday, Father Tom Uzhunnallil, an Indian Catholic priest, was crucified by IS.

The ethnic cleansing of Christians throughout the Middle East is one of the crimes against humanity of our time, and I am appalled that there has been little serious international protest.

But the real target is not Christianity but freedom. Neither is this a war. Wars are fought between nations, by armies, and the intended victims are combatants. Terrorists wear no uniforms and their intended victims are innocent civilians.

There have been ages of terror before but never on this scale, and never with the kind of technology that has given the jihadists the ability to radicalise individuals throughout the world.

The aim of IS is political: to make Islam once more an imperial power. But there is another aim shared by many jihadist groups: to silence anyone and anything that threatens to express a different truth, another faith, a different approach to religious difference. That is what lay behind the attacks on the Danish cartoons; on Catholics after a speech by Pope Benedict XVI; the murder of Theo van Gogh; and the attacks on Charlie Hebdo. The calculation of the terrorists is that, in the long run, the West will prove too tired to defend its own freedoms. They are prepared to keep committing atrocities for as long as it takes.

This kind of movement cannot be defeated by military means alone. The world needs to hear another voice from within Islam.

We need people of all faiths to express their active opposition to terror in the name of God.

No genuine religion ever needed violence to prove its beauty, or terror to establish its truth. This is not faith but sacrilege.
