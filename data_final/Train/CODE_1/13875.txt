According to the reporters, a teacher had been stabbed by the three people who had claimed to be Islamic State supporters at a Jewish school in Marseille, France on Wednesday. The attack came less than a week after the Paris massacre, as told to Sky News by the prosecutors.

As reported, the teacher was been harassed in the street and then was been stabbed on Wednesday night by three people claiming themselves as supporters of ISIS.

They arrived on two scooters. One of them was wearing a T-shirt of ISIS. He showed a picture of Mohamed Merah on mobile phone to the teacher. Mohamed Merah is a homegrown Islamist militant who had put to death seven people in a chain of attacks in southern France in 2012.

According to the Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said, â€œThe three people insulted, threatened and then stabbed their victim in the arm and leg, but they were interrupted by the arrival of a car and fled.

The victim was 57 year old and was wearing a kippa. He was been attacked outside his home, at short distance from the school at about 8 pm.
