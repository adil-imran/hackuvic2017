Kayakoy, Turkey

Abandoned in 1923, it features in Russell Crowe's recent film, The Water Diviner. It's an eerie spot, but in 2014 plans to redevelop it were announced.

Louis de Bernieres, whose novel Birds Without Wings took inspiration from the village (Eskibahçe, the fictional setting for the novel, was based on Kayaköy), said the development “could either be a wonderful rebirth, or a terrible act of vandalism, depending on how sensitively it is done. “The town cannot take motor traffic, as the streets are too narrow, and putting in infrastructure might cause damage,” he added. “The restorations should be as authentic as possible, so that the former way of life is evident.”
