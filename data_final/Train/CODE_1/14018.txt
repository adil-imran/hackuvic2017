Knife attacker who stormed Paris police station with ISIS flag ‘was an asylum seeker’

A KNIFEMAN who stormed a Paris police station carrying a piece of paper showing the ISIS flag lived in a German asylum centre, cops have revealed.

The attacker was wearing a fake explosives vest and shouted “Allah Akbar” – God is Great – during the terrifying incident before he was shot dead.

German cops said they had raided an apartment at an asylum centre in the western city of Recklinghausen.

They claimed it had been occupied by the attacker.

Officers said they were acting on “concrete evidence” obtained from French security authorities.

They said the results of the search are still being evaluated but there is no evidence of further possible attacks being planned.

Cops said they would not release any further information at the moment to avoid jeopardising the ongoing investigation.

French investigators are still trying to determine the true identity of the man who was originally identified as Sallah Ali. Paris prosecutor Francois Molins confirmed the attacker was carrying a piece of paper that pledged allegiance to the leader of evil ISIS – also known as Daesh – and said “his act is linked to the deaths in Syria”. He also had a phone with a German SIM card, the prosecutor said. He said: “A mobile phone and a piece of paper, on which appear the Daesh flag and a clear written claim in Arabic, were found on the individual.”
