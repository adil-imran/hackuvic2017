The BCB intends to extend Thilan Samaraweera's spell as Bangladesh batting consultant until next year's Champions Trophy. Cricket operations committee chairman Akram Khan said that Samaraweera is prepared to stay on in his role.

"We are keeping him," Akram told BDnews24.com. "Everyone is positive about him. The coach wants him to stay back, and so does everyone else. He also doesn't have any reservations about it."

Samaraweera joined Bangladesh ahead of the Afghanistan series for a stint that was initially to run until the end of the England series. But now he will be part of the coaching staff for the tours to New Zealand, India, Sri Lanka, Ireland and England in the upcoming seven months.

Bangladesh's coaching staff has been revamped after Heath Streak and Ruwan Kalpage quit as bowling and assistant coach respectively earlier this year. Courtney Walsh replaced Streak while Samaraweera also joined as batting coach, though the BCB has said it is still looking for a spin bowling coach. Richard Halsall, previously the fielding coach, has been promoted to the assistant coach's position.
