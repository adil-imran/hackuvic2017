On March 4, Azerbaijani armed forces inflicted pre-emptive strikes on Armenian positions on the contact line of troops in response to the attempt of diversion prepared by Armenian armed forces, the ministry said.

As a result of the strikes, military vehicles and dozens of soldiers of Armenian army were eliminated, the ministry said, noting that the Armenian authorities still continue to hide from the people information about diversions committed by the country’s army.

“Any attempt of Armenian armed forces to commit diversion on the contact line of troops and shell Azerbaijani civilians will be immediately and resolutely suppressed by Azerbaijani armed forces, and Armenian military facilities in Aghdere, Madagis, Talish and other directions will be destroyed,” the Azerbaijani ministry warned.
