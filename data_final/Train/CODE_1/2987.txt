Senior MP: Russian Fighter Jets' Flights from Iran Based on Decision of Joint Operations Room

TEHRAN (FNA)- Chairman of the Iranian parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Commission Alaeddin Boroujerdi underlined that the Russian warplanes flew from Nojeh airbase in Western Iran for anti-terrorism operations in Syria last week based on a decision made by the joint operations room in Damascus.

"What was done in Nojeh was in the framework of the joint operations room which has been active in both Damascus and Baghdad for the past one year, otherwise we wouldnâ€™t see the current situation in the region," Boroujerdi told reporters in Tehran on Wednesday.

He blasted the US and its European allies for spending billions of dollars and sending tens of thousands of trained terrorists from over 80 world states to the region to stir crisis in the regional states.

A prominent Syrian analyst had said in April that Tehran, Moscow and Damascus have planned to run a joint command and control center to win back the strategic city of Aleppo.

Issa al-Zahir rejected media claims that Russia has withdrawn from the operations to seize back Aleppo, and said, "A joint operations room, consisting of the Syrian, Iranian and Russian experts and advisors, will command the Syrian army and its allies in their military operations to free Aleppo city."

Also, yesterday, Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) Ali Shamkhani underlined that the military, intelligence and political alliance formed among Tehran, Moscow and Damascus has defused the US strategy of procrastination in anti-terrorism operations in Syria.

"The close coordination among Iran, Russia and Syria in conducting the recent operations against the Takfiri terrorists in Syria brought into failure the US protracting strategy for imposing its will on the security equations in Syria," Shamkhani said in an interview with the state-run TV on Tuesday.

Stressing that the western and Saudi media's psychological war against increased cooperation among Iran, Russia and Syria is aimed at diverting attention from the heavy failure of their allies in Palmyra (Tadmur), Idlib, Lattakia and Aleppo, he said, "Certain western and Arab countries which have the illusion of changing the regional equations, have been paralyzed by the Islamic Republic's political, defensive and security initiative in the recent operations."

Shamkhani dismissed certain imprecise views on anti-terrorism cooperation between Tehran and Moscow, and said, "The all-out relations between Iran and Russia which are based on the national interests and within the framework of strategic cooperation are not merely limited to the fight against terrorism and have more extensive aspects."
