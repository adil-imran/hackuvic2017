Narayanganj (AsiaNews) - This morning, Bangladesh police killed three militants, including Ahmed Tamim Chowdhury, the mastermind of the 1 July Dhaka massacre. The three were holed up in a three-story building in the Paikpara, Narayanganj (about 30 km south of the capital).

Police sources said that the location has been identified thanks to two supporters who had been arrested on mass murder charges.

Codenamed ‘Hit Strong 27’, the operation was carried out by a joint team of counterterrorism and transnational crimes unit. The raid began at 9:36 am (local time) and ended an hour later. The police said they tried to persuade the militants to surrender, who responded by firing at them.

Tamim, 30, was the most wanted in connection with the massacre of foreigners at the Holey Artisan Bakery Cafe in Gulshan, the diplomatic district of the capital.

Of Bangladeshi origin, he had lived in Canada with his family who emigrated in the 1970s. In 2013 he returned to Bangladesh via Dubai, and then disappeared without leaving a trace.

According to Bangladesh’ anti-terrorist authorities, he had created the ‘Neo JMB’ (Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh), a new branch of the Islamic group banned by the authorities.

The statements of investigators also indicate that the group did not appear to have links with the terrorists of the Islamic State, even though international media continue to make this claim.

The massacre orchestrated by Tamim claimed the lives of 20 people. Until then Bangladesh was considered a safe country, with a welcoming and open Islam.

Only later was it revealed that hundreds of young people have disappeared to join the militants, bewitched by the ideas of some radical preachers who glorify violence and hatred, as well as widespread extremist sermons in mosques or the teachings of professors who encourage attacks against non-Muslims.
