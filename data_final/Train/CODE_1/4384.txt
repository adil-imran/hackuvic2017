Australia has found itself sandwiched between its longstanding American security ally and the Russians in a hot dispute over a botched air strike on Syrian targets that involved Royal Australian Air Force jets.

VIDEO Syria ceasefire seen near collapse

Malcolm Turnbull has confirmed RAAF fighter jets were supporting a US-led coalition strike that mistakenly killed up to 80 Syrian Government soldiers at the weekend.

The incident has threatened a delicate ceasefire negotiated between Washington and Moscow and provoked simmering tensions caused by rival intentions in the war-torn region.

Russia, which backs the Syrian Government led by Bashar al-Assad, has complained loudly about the strike, calling for intervention by the UN Security Council and greater co-ordination with US-led forces.

But US President Barack Obama’s administration is deeply distrustful of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s long-term agenda in Syria and accused Moscow of a “stunt” in the UN.

Scepticism appears shared by Australia, with the Prime Minister saying “contradictions are obvious” in Moscow’s diplomatic moves, in reference to Russia’s military activity in Syria.

Russia has been accused of bombing hospitals and other civilian structures in Aleppo and other Syrian towns.

“I’ll resist the temptation to run into a commentary on Russia’s diplomatic response,” Mr Turnbull said in Central Park yesterday.

The PM, who is in New York for top-level UN talks, met Mr Putin at the G20 meeting in China a fortnight ago.

Mr Putin told him that though Islamic State was a common enemy, Moscow would not tolerate a “revolution” in Syria that installed rebel forces. It would support a transition from Mr Assad involving elections.

Defence Minister Marise Payne yesterday refused to say which Australian planes were involved in the bungle but said there had been no change to the RAAF's operations.

The RAAF’s Middle East air task group has six F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets, a KC-30A tanker for air-to-air refuelling and a Boeing Wedgetail, which provides battlefield surveillance and allocates targets for aircraft to strike.

Russian media has reported the fighters that performed the physical airstrikes were F-16s and A-10s, which the RAAF does not operate.

Senator Payne said there was no link between the bungle and recent changes to the rules of engagement for Australian pilots designed to limit their exposure to legal action.

The Greens and independent senator Nick Xenophon both called for an independent investigation into the bungled raid. , with Acting Greens leader Scott Ludlam renewing demands for Australia to withdraw from Iraq.

Australian Defence Association head Neil James said coalition forces had gone to enormous lengths to minimise the risk of mistakes.

“It’s notable because it’s so rare,” he said.

Islamic State yesterday claimed a perpetrator of a mass stabbing in Minnesota, one of three attacks on US soil on Saturday that included a bomb that injured 29 people in downtown Manhattan, was one of their “soldiers”.

Mr Turnbull said says the best response to acts of terrorism was defiance, with people continuing their everyday life.

The PM is among more than 40 world leaders who have gathered in New York for the United Nations General Assembly.

“It’s important to learn from these instances but above all, it is important not to be cowered, to go about your lives in the normal way,” he said.

"You see today New Yorkers are going about their lives.

“The one thing we can't do is let people who seek to do us harm, whatever their motivations may be, to cower us.”
