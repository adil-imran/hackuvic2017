The House passed a resolution on Wednesday condemning the terrorist attacks in Brussels that have reignited the debate over combating the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

The measure, passed by a vote of 409-0, expresses condemnation of Tuesday's attacks for which ISIS has claimed responsibility and offers condolences for the more than 30 people who were killed. More than 200 others were wounded.

“With this resolution, we’re sending a clear message that we stand with the people of Belgium,” said Rep. Eliot Engel (N.Y.), the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

The resolution states that “the loss of innocent lives in Brussels strengthens our resolve to defeat ISIS” and asserts that "we stand in solidarity with our Belgian allies in their time of national mourning.”

Explosions at the Brussels airport and a metro station were the latest attacks in Europe organized by ISIS following the November massacre in Paris.

“We must do more than just express our sorrow. We must take decisive action to eliminate the threat, including expanding information sharing with our friends and allies, putting stronger border checks in place, combating the online propaganda and hate speech of ISIS extremists, and sharpening coalition efforts to destroy ISIS itself,” said House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-Calif.).

President Obama on Tuesday ordered flags to be flown at half-staff through Saturday to honor the victims of the attacks. The presidential proclamation applies to all public buildings, including the Capitol Hill campus.

Passage of the resolution marked the House’s last order of legislative business before adjourning for a two-week Easter recess. The next House votes will be held April 12.
