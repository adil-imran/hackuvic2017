News New York/AP ^ | Oct. 25, 2016

MCALLEN, Texas  There has been a surge of immigrants illegally crossing into the United States leading up to next months presidential election.

CBS News reports dozens of immigrants have been streaming through the streets of McAllen, Texas, on a daily basis. They have been taken to a migrant center at Sacred Heart Catholic Church where they were released by Border Patrol, with ankle monitors, while they file for asylum.

The smugglers are telling them if Hillary [Clinton] gets elected, that therell be some sort of amnesty, that they need to get here by a certain date, Cabrera said. Theyre also being told that if [Donald] Trump gets elected, theres going to be some magical wall that pops up overnight and once that wall gets up, nobody will ever get in again.

Cabrera added that theyve encountered up to 1,000 immigrants along McAllens stretch of the border some days.

This is insanity!

But no matter how many arrive we will still have only 11 million illegals. It’s a mathematical conundrum.

We're not a sovereign nation anymore. We've become an unassimilated boarding house for the Third World.
