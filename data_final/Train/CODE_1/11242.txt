NEW DELHI—Congress leader Jagdish Tytler, a key accused of 1984 Sikh genocide, was interrogated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in cases of assassinating Sikhs following the murder of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Notably, the CBI had earlier given clean chit to Jagdish Tytler in these cases. On September 9, Jagdish Tytler answered the questions of CBI regarding his role in inciting mobs against the Sikhs in parts of Delhi.

Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Shivali Sharma had directed the CBI to complete probe within two months in reaction to an earlier demand of two additional months by a CBI prosecutor to complete the investigation. The magistrate had made it clear that the Superintendent of Police would have to give explanation if the investigation doesn’t give any fruitful result.

It is notable here that media references and reports of Human rights commission reveal that Jagdish Tytler and Kamal Nath were heading the Hindu mobs which burnt Sikhs alive during the genocide in Delhi. One of the case dates back to November 1984 Sikh in which victims Badal Singh, Thakar Singh and Gurcharan Singh were massacred by the Hindu mobs in Gurdwara Sahib in Pul Bangash area and Jagidsh Tytler is considered as a main accused of the case.
