Umno veteran says members from both sides of the political divide should meet and “have some rendang and lemang” for betterment of Malaysia and strengthen bonds within the brotherhood.

GOMBAK: Umno veteran Rais Yatim said there was nothing wrong in former Premier Mahathir Mohamad shaking hands with Anwar Ibrahim.

In fact, he suggested the same for Barisan Nasional and the Opposition pact during the coming Hari Raya Aidiladha, which falls on Sept 12.

He said members from both sides of the political divide should meet up and “have some rendang and lemang and defer political lines as a means of social networking for the betterment of Malaysia”.

“It is good for the country’s multiracial society. It is encouraged in Islam to strengthen bonds within the brotherhood.

“So, why are there so many questions being asked about them shaking hands?

“People should not read into the minds of others, if Mahathir did it for political reasons.

“We should not predetermine the intentions of others until we actually know about it,” he said after attending a cultural evening at the International Islamic University (IIU) today.

He said even Umno leaders have exchanged handshakes, hugged and kissed non-Muslim leaders.

“This is after all Mahathir and Anwar. Nothing wrong with both of them shaking hands. They have not met for a long time.

“We must understand, politics is very fluid and changes from time to time. What is important is for them to strengthen the bonds that help to improve a person’s character.”

Currently, Rais, who is the social and cultural adviser to the government, said the lesson Malaysians should learn from this handshake was that despite being political enemies, people should not forget their bonds of brotherhood.

He said when politicians debate, it should be done in the spirit of nation building.

For instance, he mentioned that Britain’s Conservative and Labour parties had often joined hands to build Britain.

“You can see that no former British prime minister has ever condemned the current prime minister, be it Gordon Brown, Tony Blair or David Cameron.

“That sort of philosophy is good. We should follow this Westminister spirit.

“But if it is not done here, it is not too late. We can still do it, according to the spirit of muhibbah and Islamic tenets.”

Mahathir’s attacks on Prime Minister Najib Razak have been more harsh than any he had levelled against former Premier Abdullah Ahmad Badawi.

On Monday, social media was flooded with pictures of Mahathir and Anwar shaking hands and chatting cordially in the KL High Court witness room where Anwar had sought an injunction to stop implementation of the National Security Council (NSC) Act.

In 1998, Dr Mahathir sacked Anwar from his post as deputy prime minister following allegations of corruption and sodomy, sparking the Reformasi movement drawing thousands of protesters into the streets.

Asked on the assault on Sri Lankan High Commissioner to Malaysia Ibrahim Sahib Ansar, at KL International Airport, Rais said police would have to probe if they were Malaysians or foreigners who had their personal motives.

“It should not have happened. Police are investigating the case. Let them do the job,” said the former foreign minister.

So far, police have arrested five people regarding the case. It is believed the group was at the airport to look for former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Almost 100 protesters had gathered in Kuala Lumpur last week to rally against Rajapaksa, who was attending an international conference, to protest killings of Tamils during the civil war.
