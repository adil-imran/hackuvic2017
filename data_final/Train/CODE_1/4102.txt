Hillary Free Speech Preview: Black Man Tossed Down Stairs at Rally, Clinton Tells Crowd (tr)

Posted on by TigerClaws

A preview of Free Speech in America under a Hillary Clinton regime.

An African American man wearing a Bil Clinton Rape T-Shirt was tossed down the stairs at a Hillary rally Monday before being escorted out by police and security.

Hillary watched the events unfold from her nearby perch on the speakers stage and she cackled in great delight as the protestor was muscled from the event by authorities and jeered by the crowd.

Hillary then said she hoped crowd members would follow him outside and stage an intervention. No, this isnt a story from TheOnion.com. This is life on the campaign trail with Hillary and her bizarre-world supporters, who laugh at a Bill Clinton rape shirt and and African American man getting manhandled like a black man at the Democratic National Convention in the 1960s.

Other news outlets reported that the man was ejected from the event, but there is always another story in the details. No one beyond True Pundit reported the man getting thrown down the stairs and then being removed by what looks like an atomic wedgie.

Only video I have right now. You can see him getting pushed down / arm twisted behind Hillary. Remember when the MSM complained about the 'violent rhetoric' of Trump that led to violence at his events? Sure they'll say the same here. https://twitter.com/NikkiProverbs31/status/785565643105939456/video/1

This man needs to come forward and tell his story to Hannity and/or Rush.



To: TigerClaws

She should be sued for inciting that. She was calling for the crowd to do something before the man was attacked.



To: TigerClaws

Hillary then said she hoped crowd members would follow him outside and stage an intervention. I did not realize the word intervention was synonymous with lynching. Who knew?

Also, it looks like she's using a green screen. There's a slight halo around her like an image fit is going on. Check it out.

Maybe Mr Trump can place him in the audience for the next debate. Because you know she’s going to call him a racist.

If the tables were turned and Trump said something like that, the media would spin it as negatively as possible, as they always do.

Hillary’s gonna have an intervention 11/8.

And life for the Clintons and their co-conspirators will change quickly.

My bet is that the guy is an actor hired by the Clinton Campaign. There is no way they (security) nor the other people in the crowd would even have let him be in full on camera view. Hillary was just trying to mimic when Trump had people thrown out so she could look decisive and strong. (Stronger Together). It was to help ‘rally’ her ‘crowd’. Get their ‘juices’ going. Of course, we see it as her being hypocritical (because of her complaint about Trump doing it) but Libs/Dems have no problem complaining about an incident and then doing it themselves if they think they can gain something from it. They are blind to hypocrisy.

Yes, they want to control everything and plan everything. There is no spontaneity in Hillarys life.

Yes, but I’m probably 100% wrong about him being hired by Hillary’s Campaign. I think he’s one of those people who have responded to Alex Jones ‘offer’ to pay anyone who wears one of these shirts and gets on national TV for a few minutes, or anyone who yells out “Bill’s a rapist” on national TV. BUT, we’ll probably never know for sure.
