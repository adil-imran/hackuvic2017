A response to the Armenian provocation has been given on the pages of Uruguayan La Republica newspaper and Uruguayan news agency (UYPRESS) portal.

According to sources in the Foreign Ministry, the Armenian community of Uruguay held the Nagorno Karabakh forum devoted to creation of the separatist regime in the occupied lands of Azerbaijan in the capital city of the country - Montevideo, of which La Republica and the portal of the Uruguay news agency wrote on their pages.

The publications note that Nagorno Karabakh is a historical territory of Azerbaijan which is considered by the international community as an integral part of the republic, speak about the occupation of 20% of Azerbaijani lands, holding ethnic cleansing, as a result of which nearly a million of Azerbaijan became refugees and displaced persons.

It is also noted that conduction of the forum pursues provocative aims, causes damage to the peace process mediated by the Minsk Group and serves propaganda of the occupational regime created in the occupied lands of Azerbaijan.
