Trust in Islam?

American Thinker ^ | 10 Oct, 2016 | Donna Maskell

Posted on by MtnClimber

Islamic doctrine regarding lying is different than what Christians (among others, but Christianity is what I am familiar with) might expect. The term taqiyya describes when it is acceptable to lie. Here is a summary excerpt:

Muslim scholars teach that Muslims should generally be truthful to each other, unless the purpose of lying is to "smooth over differences."

There are several forms of lying to non-believers that are permitted under certain circumstances, the best known being taqiyya. These circumstances are typically those that advance the cause of Islam -- in some cases by gaining the trust of non-believers in order to draw out their vulnerability and defeat them...............................

This doesn't mean all Muslims lie, all the time. Such generalizations go too far. The problem is that you aren't safe in assuming any Muslim is ever telling you the truth. Does he or she fear Allah? It doesn't mean they won't lie to you.

I wonder, when Mohammed first was proselytizing for Islam, when all were unbelievers, what kinds of lies he felt were necessary to spread his religion? Did he ever tell anyone the whole truth? Can a perfect man, as Mohammed is alleged to be, tell lies? Jesus didn't, but Mohammed did. Can he kill people? Jesus didn't, but Mohammed did. Can he spread his religion by force, at the edge of a sword or the point of a gun? Jesus didn't, but Mohammed did.

Do any living Muslims know the truth of Islam? Or do they just know they will be killed for trying to leave it? Christians have their flaws and difficulties, and yes, most of us seem to lie at one time or another, but we believe it to be wrong, in all cases. Muslims don't.

I trust in Islam for it to be the vilest creation ever invented by a pedophile murdering man to justify his own sins and perversions.

mohammad was not just a murdering pedophile. He was a mass murdering, thieving, mass raping, serial pedophile, kidnapping slave trader.

Islamic societies will always be backward, corrupt and violent. Certainly, there are theoretical reasons you can say this - lack of societal trust, Islam’s all-pervasive forced collectivism, Its primitive, clan-based cultural model - and other reasons. Or you can simply extrapolate from present Muslim societies. Few, if any, are successful. Many are among the most backward, ill-educated, in-bred/low intellect places on earth.

Not even among muslims in the office environment.

When I was in Bahrain after the first Gulf War I paid attention to the Saudi prayers that were televised and subtitled in English. They seemed to be mainly based on jealously of Israel (which has one of the highest average IQ scores in the world) and why allah has forsaken the arabs (which have a very low average IQ score). Jealousy and revenge for being forsaken was the core of the prayers.

The Plague of Islam If the civilized world is to survive, Islam must be understood for what it really is: Its not a religion, form of government, or anything recognizable to the civilized mind. Islam is a disease, an incurable disease of the mind that is highly contagious among the feeble minded and is now spreading among the worlds feeble minded at an epidemic rate. As with any disease, one cant reason with this disease, negotiate with it, or treat in a manner other than how one would treat any other incurable disease. As past efforts to contain this disease have failed, carriers of this Plague of Islam must be eradicated wherever they're found, for if they're not, this disease will eventually end not just Western Civilization, but it will undo over 5,000 years of human civilization.

“Muslim scholars teach that Muslims should generally be truthful to each other, unless the purpose of lying is to “smooth over differences.” stopped reading there because if they will lie to other muslims to “smooth over differences” then inevitably the difference will arise again. Ridiculous way to live and if that’s what they do with people they are more familiar with can’t be any better for less familiar people.
