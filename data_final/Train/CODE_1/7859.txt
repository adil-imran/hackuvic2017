REPUBLIKA.CO.ID, JAKARTA -- The secretary general of the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) Tengku Zulkarnain felt disappointed with the government which did not held any commemoration for the victims killed by Indonesian Communist Party (PKI).



The September 30 Movement (G30S) in 1965 was a rebellion by PKI. Many generals and Islamic clerics were killed and it was not just coup attempt.



"PKI rebellion did not only happen in 1965. In 1946 occurred massacre by the PKI, particularly in Sumatra, many of the Muslim families were killed by them," he said to Republika.co.id, Saturday (10/1).



Tengku said it was not just a rumor. His family were among the victims. In March 1946, PKI killed his grandfather, a doctor who lived in Sumatra.



In Muslim-majority country, most casualties caused by PKI happened to Muslims. Meanwhile, Muslim's political party, Masyumi, also been banned. In 1955 the PKI reached fourth position in the result of voting and allowed to exist.



"First President Soekarno dissolved Masyumi and allowed PKI in the 1955 general election," he explained.



Tengku worried PKI ideology still exist in Indonesia. However, he felt optimistic Indonesian people not easily provoked and obey Islamic teaching.
