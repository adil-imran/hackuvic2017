The extraordinary picture was recovered by German police from an Algerian who was arrested at a refugee shelter in the town Attendorn on Thursday.

The 34-year-old man can be seen posing with a HUGE arsenal cache of weapons and ammunition, grenades, machine guns, gun cartridges and a tactical helmet, but it is not clear where the image was taken.

Police said the man posing in an ISIS-style headband and combats had military training in Syria but arrived in Germany with his family in 2015.

He had already begun the asylum application process.

Intelligence gathered suggest he was part of a terror cell aiming to massacre civilians.

Police swooped on the suspected jihadi on Thursday when 450 heavily-armed police officers raided properties across Germany, including two refugee centres on Thursday.

As well as the Algerian pictured and his wife, one man was arrested over fake identification documents.
