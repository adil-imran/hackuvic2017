Video captured the moment a driver reportedly ran over a Muslim woman during an anti-immigration protest Saturday in the Brussels suburb of Molenbeek, a region that terror experts have called a hub for extremist activity.

Warning: Video may be considered graphic.

The driver of the Audi A1 sped right past a checkpoint, initially knocking the woman onto the hood of the car, local media report. The video shows her sliding to the ground before the Audi runs over her to the sound of terrified screams.

Investigators said the woman survived but suffered broken bones and head injuries. Two 20-year-old men eventually turned themselves in, according to Belgian news agency La Libre, which added that the men smelled of alcohol.

A far-right France-based group had announced plans to demonstrate in Molenbeek Saturday, drawing more than 400 people. At least one person was detained, and witnesses saw several minor fights between police and young people.

Molenbeek was home to some of the men who linked to the March 22 bombings in Belgium that killed 32 people, as well as the Nov. 13 massacre in Paris that killed 130. The Islamic State terror group claimed responsibility for the attacks.
