SRINAGAR: A group of terrorists, who took refuge in a multi-storeyed government building complex, engaged security forces in a day-long gunbattle, in Pampore town, on the outskirts of the summer capital on Monday.Two security personnel were injured in the heavy exchange of fire by gunmen holed up at the hostel of Jammu and Kashmir Entrepreneurship Development Institute (JKEDI), the same complex that had been partly destroyed by a terror strike less than eight months ago.The February attack had left the institute non-functional for young entrepreneurs. On Monday, the Kashmir valley was rife with speculation that the second strike on the complex was to dissuade Kashmiri youth from entrepreneurship and any engagement with the government.Sources said the presence of terrorists inside the hostel was suspected by a staff member early on Monday when he noticed smoke coming out of the building, which was closed due to the ongoing unrest in the valley since July. Sources said the staffer, who stays at the EDI guest house, went up seven storeys to investigate and discovered that the staircase had been blocked with hostel furniture.The terrorists seemed to be preparing for an attack on an Army or paramilitary convoy along the national highway, police sources said. One of the armed terrorists opened fire on the staffer but he escaped unhurt and informed EDI director M I Parray, which led to the complex being cordoned off at 6am.A joint operation was launched by the Army, Special Operations Group of the state police and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).The terrorists, whose exact number is not known, used their ammunition sparingly and constantly changed their positions through the whole day. Live television broadcast of the encounter showed massive amounts of smoke enveloping the 70-room, seven-storeyed building. Loud explosions were heard too.Residents in the area told media that the terrorists had entered the institute from the river side. Last week, Srinagar city was put on high alert following specific intelligence about an imminent terror strike in the summer capital or along the Srinagar-Jammu highway.
