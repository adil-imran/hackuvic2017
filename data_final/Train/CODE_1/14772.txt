Baghdad: An Iraqi court on Thursday sentenced 40 men to hang over the June 2014 massacre by allied militants of hundreds of military recruits in Tikrit, the judiciary said.

The central criminal court in Baghdad found 40 of 47 defendants guilty of involvement in the ‘Speicher’ massacre, named after the base near where the victims were captured before being executed.

“The court ordered the execution of 40 people convicted of involvement in the incident, while seven were released for lack of evidence,” Iraq’s judiciary spokesman Abdel Sattar Bayraqdar said in the statement.

Bayraqdar said the sentences were handed down under Article Four of Iraq’s anti-terrorism law, which states that anyone who perpetrates, incites, plans, finances or assists acts of terrorism will be sentenced to death.

A judicial source said all 47 were Iraqi citizens and present in court for their sentencing.

“Some of them actually did the killing and others assisted them in this crime,” the official, who could not give his name because he was not authorised to talk to the press, said.

He said the 40 were sentenced to death by hanging.

The court itself did not reveal the identities of the defendants nor any details of the circumstances of their arrest.

In a similar trial in July 2015, 24 men were sentenced to hang over the Speicher massacre, which was committed during the first days of the IS group’s sweeping offensive in Iraq.

All of them had denied involvement.

Some had said they were not even near Tikrit at the time, others that they never saw a lawyer and that the confessions used to secure convictions were obtained under torture.

Rights groups had criticised that trial as not meeting many of the standards required for such crimes.

The highest estimate for the number of men murdered in the Speicher massacre is 1,700. Tikrit was retaken from IS in April 2015. — AFP
