A massacre of civilians in Ethiopia, a State situated in the Horn of Africa, where over 140 people were killed by armed groups in an attack close to the border with South Sudan. It was reported by Ethiopian Minister of Communications Getachew Reda. Reda added that the assailants, who are members of the Murle tribe, came from South Sudan and killed numerous civilians, including women and children. Whereas more children would have been kidnapped and taken to South Sudan. Ethiopian forces killed 60 militants in their turn and they might cross the border to hunt down the surviving attackers.

The pro-government television station “FBC”, citing Army sources, reported that the assault was carried out by unidentified “individuals armed to the teeth” against Jakawa, a remote village in Gembela region, in the extreme West of Ethiopia. Among other ethnic groups which inhabit this area, there are also two ethnic groups of Nilotic descent, the Nuer and Anuak, who have been protagonists of many battles of particular violence in the last few years: both devoted primarily to sheep farming, even if the latter is more sedentary, due to the recent droughts they have been competing for the control of lands destined to livestock.

As reported WHO (World Health Organization) denounces, Ethiopia and Somalia are experiencing the worst drought of the last 30 years, which cause unprecedented damage to sheep farming and agriculture. “Ethiopia is facing one of the most serious climate shocks in its history, with ten million people at risk of losing crops and livestock, besides having severe water shortage and health problems – explained Ahunna Eziakonwa-Onuchie, UN coordinator of response to drought -. We are launching a campaign to increased funding, so as to make it commensurate to the scale and gravity of this crisis”.
