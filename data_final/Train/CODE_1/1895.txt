The United Nations (UN) has endorsed the African Union’s proposal to deploy a 5,000-strong peacekeeping force to the troubled Burundi despite the country’s opposition.

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon gave the endorsement in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Saturday at the opening of the 26th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the Heads of State and Government of the African Union, with the theme, 2016: African Year of Human Rights, with Particular Focus on the Rights of Women.

The UN scribe told the African leaders at the summit that he welcomed their proposal to deploy human rights observers as well as to establish a prevention and protection mission in Burundi.Ki Moon applauded the African leaders for taking collective responsibility and acting decisively on ending armed conflict in Burundi, saying the UN was ready to support their efforts.He said, “In Burundi, I welcome your proposal to deploy human rights observers and to establish a prevention and protection mission. This crisis requires the most serious and urgent commitment from all of us. I applaud you for taking collective responsibility and acting decisively. The United Nations stands ready to support your efforts. As the Universal Declaration says, everyone, without distinction of any kind, is entitled to human rights. Peace and security, development and human rights are won only when we commit to protecting the rights of others, regardless of skin colour, religion, ethnicity, political beliefs, sexual orientation, gender, age, disability, or other distinctions.”AU Commission Chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma had last week said the crisis in Burundi required unity of purpose and action by the global community. She had also appealed to AU member states to promote and defend Africa’s positions as articulated by the AU Peace and Security Council to deploy 5,000 troops to Burundi.Burundi’s two chambers of parliament had last December unanimously rejected the AU’s plan to deploy peacekeepers, with a caution that doing so would violate the nation’s constitution and sovereignty.
