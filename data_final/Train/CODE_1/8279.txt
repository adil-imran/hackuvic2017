Muslims are now more disliked than atheists and homosexuals

WASHINGTON - Believing in Allah is worse than believing in no god at all, according to a recent study that surveyed U.S. residents.



The study from sociologists at the University of Minnesota who compared Americans perceptions of minority faith and racial groups found that Muslims are now more unpopular than both atheists and homosexuals.



But the study marks a grimmer milestone  Americans disapproval of Muslims has jumped to 45.5 percent from just over 26 percent 10 years ago, the last time the question was asked, just a few years after the September 11 attacks.



Almost half of those surveyed  48.9 percent  said they would disapprove of their child marrying a Muslim, up from 33.5 percent in 2006.



Atheists are disapproved by 41.9 percent of those surveyed, up less than two percent from ten years ago. Homosexuals meanwhile are disliked by 29.4 percent of those surveyed.



Whats stunning about the research is nearly every group saw drastic increases in dislikes, including Conservative Christians, Hispanics, Jews and African American. Residents also share significant animosity towards Immigrants. 10 years ago when the survey asked about the particular group, only 12.5 percent said they were disliked.



Today, that number has more than doubled to 25.6 percent. The findings depict a tense political climate in the U.S. Hussein Rashid, an adjunct professor at Barnard College who frequently writes and consults about Islam in the U.S., said the jump in anti-Islamic sentiment the study pinpoints is reflected in the current political rhetoric. The data from this survey shows that there is an increasing pull away from the promise of America, he said in an email. In 10 years, people have a more negative perception of Muslims, Jews, gays, Latinos, and Blacks. As a new America is taking shape, with all its diversity, there is a reactionary response that wants a mythic America of everyone being exactly the same.



The study was written from data collected in 2014 from 2,500 participants. It was published in the current issue of Social Forces journal. The previous study was published in 2006 by three of the same authors.

Don’t muslims want to kill all atheists and homosexuals even more than jews?

Yep, issues with perceptions of Islam, according to him, are all about political rhetoric, and resistance to the dream of diversity. Beheadings, terrorist attacks, burning people alive, throwing people such as homosexuals off of tall buildings — none of that feeds into people’s perceptions of Islam. It’s all overheated political rhetoric, and we who feel that way violate the promise of America. Okay..............

I think you are right. And considering that, it still saddens and amazes me, that the liberals and the media reaction to Orlando was to push gun control. The fact that the Orlando massacre was the biggest Muslim terrorist attack in this country since 9/11, and the fact that the perpetrator targeted the homosexual community, seemed lost on the media.



To: akalinin

Last I looked neither atheists or homos were blowing people up or chopping their heads off. That *might* have a wee bit to do with it.



To: dsrtsage

No. They want to kill those who refuse to submit to Allah.

This FL mass murder clearly pointed out that Moslems are now ranked #1 on the preferred groups list. Unbelievable, after the gigantic atrocity of 9/11.

“...and the fact that the perpetrator targeted the homosexual community, seemed lost on the media.” It wasn’t ‘lost’ on the Enemy Media. It was downplayed, per their Socialist agenda. Do these people even REALIZE what HELL they are inflicting upon us? And, FWIW, WHY aren’t any of the ‘elites’ in our society, government or media EVER effected by any of this? Could it be that there really ARE, ‘Two Americas?’ *SPIT*



To: akalinin

Good News!



To: akalinin

Well, atheists and homosexuals don’t try to kill people in mass numbers... They also don’t strap on a suicide vest on 12 year-old girl with Down’s Syndrome. I’ll have to research that one to find a source (it was a few years ago), but I will never forget it. Pure evil.



To: akalinin

Anyone who keeps randomly killing people should expect no less.

Believing in Allah is worse than believing in no god at all, according to a recent study that surveyed U.S. residents. Q. Which do you think is worse, someone who believes in God, or someone who is part of a 1400 year old murder cult who is secretly plotting to murder you and your entire family?

I hate islam with every fiber of my being...yet somehow I still hate communism more.



To: akalinin

The muslims are homosexual-—they grow up learning to revile and hate women and the women can’t stand the evil, vile, immature males (like Huma who prefers women). They also like sodomizing little boys which is “fine” in the Koran-—so they can groom the boys to be particualarly hateful and brutal to women and children, like the homosexual SS jackboots were. Only Christianity creates a culture which can mature and truly “love” the Other. All others fixate and traumatize children so they remain puerile and immature—fixated psychopathic narcissists who love only themselves (and people exactly the same as they are). They are incapable of true love which is self-sacrifice.

Muslims are now more unpopular than both atheists and homosexuals.

_________________________________ “Unpopular” is used here as a euphemism for the word “HATED”. Muslims are despised by most people I know, and I personally have vowed never to interact with them on any level whatsoever. Moreover, in my experience atheists and homosexuals are generally neither hated or unpopular, so long as they don’t attempt to foist their behavior or beliefs on those who are not receptive.

Yes, because they’ll allow Jews to live as dhimmi as long as they pay their jizya tax, but you can kill them if they can’t/won’t pay the tax and won’t convert to Islam.



To: the OlLine Rebel

And the left keeps saying it was a lone wolf attacker, no basis in Islam, though his imam was called out for years prior for saying killing homosexuals is a mercy because they can’t keep from sinning. Hate imam preached executing gays at Orlando mosque before massacre
