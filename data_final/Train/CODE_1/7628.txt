Take Action: 21 Years Since the Occupation of Shusha – Stop Armenia’s aggression against Azerbaijan

May 8, 2013, marks 21 years since the occupation of Shusha, an overwhelmingly Azerbaijani-populated city in the Karabakh region of Azerbaijan, by the Armed forces of Armenia. The acts of violence and ethnic cleansing carried out by Armenian forces in the course of this occupation, resulted in deaths of 480 civilians, displacement of over 22,000 Azerbaijani residents, destruction of 6800 households and over 250 cultural landmarks.

Join the Pax Turcica action to raise awareness of the occupation, ethnic and cultural cleansing carried out by Armenian forces in Shusha and other Azerbaijani territories.
