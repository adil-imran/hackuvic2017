Global Economic Security & Military Strategy Battlefield - Annexed & Occupied Territories

The Israeli PM, Benjamin Netanyahu blames the Palestinian leadeship for encouraging ethnic cleansing. He has always been perplexed by the notion “of settlements being the problem” for a two-state solution.

Netanyahu said that nearly two million Arabs are living inside Israel, and they aren’t any obstacle to peace. Israel’s diversity shows its openness and readiness for peace. Yet the Palestinian leadership actually demands a Palestinian state with no Jews, and that is called ethnic cleansing and this demand is outrageous.

The Israeli PM added, that it is even more outrageous that the world doesn’t find this outrageous? Societies that demand ethnic cleansing do not pursue peace. On the other side of the spectrum, Israel keeps on building settlements in the occupied Jordanian West Bank without consulting the Palestinians, and that is called facism.

The same fascist attitude is committed in the annexed Syrian Golan Heights and the militarly surrounded Egyptian Gaza Strip. However Netanyahu describes that what makes peace impossible is intolerance of others. Netanyahu envisions a future Middle East where young Arabs and young Jews learn together, work together, live together side by side in peace.

At the moment Israel blames the Palestinians for the violence in the Middle East and the unrest in the occupied territories. However the only party committing structural genocide and perform deadly and ruthless invasions supported by military airstrikes are the Israeli Defense Forces.

Israel only wants peace under their conditions, totally controlled by their military as the actual situation proves and provides. Also Israel operates the largest concentration (refugee) camps in the hitory of the world.
