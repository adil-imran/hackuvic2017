It is set to be a litmus test for the Election Commission as 18 seats in three Maoist-affected areas in West Bengal go to polls Monday in the first part of the first phase of the six-phase elections.

According to office of the Chief Electoral Officer in Kolkata, at least one section of central forces will be deployed at each polling station location in the Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected areas of Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore districts.

“At least one section of central forces would be present in every polling station location in LWE areas. In the non-LWE areas, there will be a minimum of half section of central forces at each polling station location,” said Dibyendu Sarkar, additional chief electoral officer.

Of the 18 seats, 13 have been roughly classified as LWE-affected where voting will end by 4 pm due to security reasons. In the remaining five constituencies of Purulia, Manbazar, Kashipur, Para and Raghunathpur voting will go on for two hours extra till 6 pm.

A little over 40 lakh (40,09,171) electors (20,47,202 males and 19,57,453 females) will vote to decide the fate of 133 candidates.

The three big parties — Trinamool Congress, Left-Congress alliance and BJP —have fielded candidates from all 18 seats. Gobordhan Bagdi is the only one fighting on two seats of Para and Raghunathpur on a JMM ticket. There are total 4,945 polling stations out of which 1,962 have been classified as critical. Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trails (VVPAT) are being done at 562 polling stations.

The EC has deployed 14 general observers, 676 micro observers, five expenditure observers, three each police and awareness observes to monitor the polling process.

In addition, two helicopters will be engaged for aerial surveillance. Officials have been provided 202 digital cameras and 642 video cameras while live webcasting will be done from 153 stations.

About 250 companies have been pressed in for the first phase. They would be deployed inside the booths and within 100-metre of the polling station.
