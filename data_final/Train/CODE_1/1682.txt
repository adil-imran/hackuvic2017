Last week Pakistan was rocked by a carefully plotted suicide attack which killed dozens of lawyers and drew international attention to the province of Balochistan. The details of the attack prove that this was a premeditated assault against a particular class of victims in the most vulnerable geostrategic location in all of Pakistan, and this makes one wonder exactly what the terrorists' long-term objectives are in doing this.To put everything into context,- not always the same thing, mind you, but nowadays overlapping - and other times being the peaceful peripheral location that it's otherwise known for.The reason why I mention Balochistan's separatist inclinations isn't because this group of fighters was responsible for the terrorist attack,in yet another internal conflict alongside the one they're periodically fighting in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, or FATA.. The reason isn't just to spread the Pakistani military far and thin, though that's part of it. Balochistan is preordained as the scene of future externally provoked violence because its historical situation predisposes it to easily exploitable tendencies,that will terminate in Gwadar port and provide the People's Republic with its first-ever reliable non-Malacca trade route to the Indian Ocean, and thenceforth to the EU, Mideast, and African marketplaces.It's part of the indirect Hybrid War on China's global infrastructure interests, using the proxy forces of international terrorism and perhaps one day soon even Balochi separatists again to achieve this goal.And let's not forget that Pakistan arrested an Indian intelligence agent from the Research and Analysis Wing, or RAW, India's version of the CIA, in Balochistan earlier this year, who admitted that he was sent by New Delhi to destabilize the province. I'm not saying that India carried out this despicable terrorist attack or was directly linked to it,In both cases,No, that's not what I mean, and people who sarcastically throw that out are purposely trying to discredit real arguments here. Let me remind you all thatThat's likely what happened here; whether India knew about it in advance or not, it ultimately ended up supporting New Delhi's interests.Always remember guys, there's no such thing as morals, ethics, or principles in geopolitics, just pure, raw ("RAW") power.This article is the partial transcript of Sputnik International Radio Show titled "Milwaukee Racist Riots, Balochistan Bombing, Thailand Explosions"
