Reporters: It's Time To Burn Donald Trump [Barf-o-matic]

The Concourse, deadspin.com ^ | Tuesday, October 11, 2016 | Ashley Feinberg

Posted on by Jyotishi

Despite what anyone may want to believe, the chances of Donald Trump moving into the White House in January are not trivial. He is still a candidate; he still has ardent supporters; and he still could be our next president. This means that, now more than ever, journalists with relevant information have a responsibility to stop wringing their hands and burn Donald Trump.

Currently, at least one potential cache of nightmarish Trump material is hiding in plain sight: Mark Burnett's video archives at The Apprentice. There are significant barriers to any of it becoming public. But there is another potential source of Trump tapes: All the dozens or hundreds of journalists who have interviewed him, often off the record, over the past 30 years.

As a rule, journalists don't burn sources because of practical considerations (doing so, they worry, would render promises of protection to other sources null), because decent people consider promises of confidentiality generally binding, and because these promises can in some circumstances be legally binding when a written or verbal contract is involved. But almost every rule -- even the very nearly sacrosanct -- has its exceptions. For reporters today, that exception is Donald J. Trump.

Time to start licensing print and broadcast “reporters” and then immediately revoking most permits. Got to reform reform reform the damn FCC and give it teeth.



To: Jyotishi

The implied message is “Well why not simply make it up? Who is going to know? What do we have to lose?”



To: Jyotishi

I am sure that if they have anything more on Trump it will be out shortly.



To: Jyotishi

Meanwhile the Ministry of Propaganda hides everything they can about the Clintons and what they can’t hide they spin at top speed.

I dont want to break out the popcorn because i wouldn’t watch such bullsh##. some aren’t getting it around here. This election is no different than one in Russia at this point. The media is govt owned. bought and paid for. Allred and ALL these writers should read up on Bastille day. They may some day wish Trump won if he doesn’t.

Don't believe that the Founders envisioned CNN and the rest of those anti-American "press". Would never have given unlimited freedom to this current crowd of Marxist parasites.



To: Resettozero

It's time to stop getting your info from the “news.” Turn them off. There is absolutely no need for them, not in this day and age. Put them out of business.

You don’t really want to give the Feds the power to license journalists, do you? The only ones they’d ever go after are Matt Drudge, Sharyl Attkisson and the guys at Breitbart.



To: Jyotishi

When Bill was running, he was guilty of worse, and it was dismissed because that was what leading men were. “All the alfa males acted that way.” Now, Trump for language only, is a rogue hater of women. I guess the alfa dog rule is no longer operable. The Left is stark raving mad and they can’t see it. I can at least see foibles in Trump. They have never voiced any objection to any of Bill’s behaviors. NEVER.

You’re preaching to the choir.



To: Jyotishi

About those Apprentice tapes? Assuming they exist, so what? No one was forced to appear on that show. Most of the participants were desperate has-beens who chose that path to revive their careers. One of the fascinations of the show was the groveling of the players. It was their choice to stay and jump through all kinds of hoops just to not be fired.

Obama reveals his happy moment in his pants, and the female reports clamored to see it, sit down in front, we want to see. That was okay. Trump, now there’s a bad guy...

It used to be about equally easy for anybody to be press back then. Now it’s becoming equally easy once more with the intertubes.

While the Apprentice pulls out its cache of videos, Hillary is having rally in Florida with a man who pulled out his ting-yang and told a masseuse to rub it. Is that sexual assault? Where is the indignation of hillary throwing in with yet another pervert?

Well, some prohibition against the freedom to LIE knowingly to the public without suffering potential loss of that freedom to Lie openly on broadcast media...especially PBS that receives tax funding. Print is kinduv different and the print media is what the Founders meant by the word "press".



To: Resettozero

...print medium...



To: HiTech RedNeck

I agree. The guy just keeps going and going doesn't he. He will make a great leader. He may not always do what we want, but I suspect he's going to shock some people at how good he leads.

To: Resettozero

You`re absolutely right. Any organization that labels themselves as a news outlet should be required to meet certain high standards that will make objective reporting more likely. Conflicts of interest regarding ownership, family ties,

etc. should not be tolerated. If you want to broadcast opinion, that`s fine. But News is a different ballgame and should meet the highest of standards. Other industries are regulated to protect against this sort of collusion, e.g. stock trading. It`s time for news outlets to be held to the same standard.



To: Resettozero

Oh it is coming. Trump will have raped women and children, sexually assaulted many, and general spawn of Satan soon. If he has and their is proof he is done, if not and they are unfounded made up she said he says, nothing to worry about



To: Resettozero

“Time to start licensing print and broadcast reporters...” Not in this country you won’t. Go someplace that doesn’t have a 1st Amendment if you want to try that s**t.



To: DoughtyOne

*****.... leading men were. All the alfa males acted that way.**** You have identified the problem. Hollywood has influenced our society for the past 80 years. In the beginning, movies reflected our JudeoChristian ethics. Men were masculine, heroic, honorable and women were strong, loving and moral. Movie content ‘progressed’ to pornographic where any type of sexual deviancy, violence etc., are acceptable. Donald Trump was involved with ‘show business’ on The Apprentice. He was likely encouraged & advised to ‘go with the most provocative content for ratings. He is a businessman. In such an atmosphere, conversations and behavior spill over to the talent and production crews. If you are making a NatGeo series about butterflies, not so much.

Where did you hear this? Not that I didn't think there was more to come... "Civil rights attorney Gloria Allred announced Monday that she represents women who accuse Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump of sexually harassing or abusing them. In doing so, she joined a chorus of sources alleging that the Access Hollywood tape of Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women is just a glimpse of his troubling, inappropriate behavior. "I cannot comment except to say that some women who allege inappropriate contact by Mr. Trump contacted me both before and after the release of the Access Hollywood tapes," Allred told Patch. "However, I cannot reveal their names or the content of their communications. Their communications are confidential." "That's about all I can say for now, and we'll have to wait and see what happens next," Allred told City News Service. A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign has not returned Patchs calls for comment. The announcement comes days after Allred dared the nominee to release his employees from nondisclosure clauses. Allreds allegations come amid an avalanche of speculation that more lewd Trump tapes exist. Fox News reporter Geraldo Rivera said he has embarrassing tapes of Trump from years of interviews, but he did not say if he would release them. Similarly, The Apprentice producer Bill Pruitt tweeted As a producer on seasons 1 & 2 of #theapprentice I assure you: when it comes to the #trump tapes there are far worse. #just beginning The tweet set off a firestorm with wealthy Clinton backer Mark Cuban tweeting he would be willing to pay the legal fees and fines of anyone willing to leak the rumored tapes. Last week the Associated Press ran a story in which The Apprentice crew members claimed Trump harassed and demeaned cast and crew, rating women by their looks and openly discussing which ones hed have sex with." patch.com (I bolded the names that appear have a part in this coordinated attack.)

..... Well ... It's all over the news here on the Left Coast. Allred is trying to persuade her clients to go public ..... Which in my estimation is only a narrative she has put out there for public consumption. ... My guess is that the timeline for coming forth into the public foray is a coordinated planned event and will be executed for maximum effect before the election. It's all about the timed narrative.

I remember back to the age of 14 when I first heard a guy talk in bawdy terms about girls/women. I didn’t care for it. From that time forward I never grew to like it. Have I ever said some things off the cuff that might be construed as bawdy? I’m sure I have, but it didn’t go vulgar as I recollect. There’s no denying how Hollywood and the music industry have impacted society. It’s a real shame to having first amendment rights folks didn’t realize that meant they had a right to conduct themselves and their industry by at least some decency standards. Alas, they didn’t get that memo. Maybe we need an amendment that states that U. S. Citizens have the right to open carry morals in public, and that it cannot be abridged by law.

Having sisters probably influences the attitude of young men as they enter puberty and beyond. During my teen years, the girls (that would be me) were flirty but not sexually active; the pubescent boys were very respectful to us, but probably acted and spoke very differently when they were in an all male environment. I attended an all girls school during that awkward age and the boys went to an all boys prep as well. Sterile and strict. Our lives were under a microscope by parents and teachers - not a bad thing.

If only you knew what you were saying. Talk real big, Boogieman, like YOU know how to defeat the Marxists. It isn't with the current definition of "free press".

My admiration for these untrustworthy, manipulative, traitorous bastards hovers somewhere between that of Benedict Arnold and Vidkun Quisling.

"I sure hope we dont lose the United States of America because Trump likes beautiful women." ..... Yup ..... Beginning to look that way. It is strange that this once free nation might be brought down without even a struggle ..... But I have to admit ... Conservatives were way too complacent the past few decades thinking they were actually in the majority and that the Constitution and system of checks and balances in the constitution would protect our Democratic Republic. ..... In the mean time the Marxist Socialists took over the entire media and education systems .... That alone allowed the Marxist propagandists to control the narratives and gave them the prime opportunity to indoctrinate almost all of our children for generations. .... Enter the "One" who came to fundamentally change America ..... He fulfilled his promise. ..... All because the Republicans .... The so called Guardians of the Constitution ..... failed at the most basic of levels seeking popularity instead of defending their own country on the home front. They never could understand the simple concept of Teamwork. They all became politicians instead of Leaders which we so dearly needed during these desperate times. I put the blame of them.

Journalists insult the First Amendment and Truth daily...hourly...every minute...every second. What dishonest, compromised losers.



To: rlbedfor

“if not and they are unfounded made up she said he says, nothing to worry about” You must be joking. The press isn’t going to worry about whether the accusations against Trump are true or not, especially if it’s a few days before the election. They’re already accusing him of having talked about “sexual assault” when he discussed women who “let” stars do what they want to them. You don’t think they’ll do everything they can to brand him a rapist when the opportunities arise, regardless of the “evidence”? If he’s exonerated in Dec., it’s not going to matter for the election.

..... In the mean time the Marxist Socialists took over the entire media and education systems .... That alone allowed the Marxist propagandists to control the narratives and gave them the prime opportunity to indoctrinate almost all of our children for generations. Yes, and if anyone reads the writings of Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci, it becomes clear that this has been the plan of the far-left since at least the 1940s. He called for a long march through the institutions (i.e. a gradual takeover of the institutions that influence opinions and who holds hegemony in society) instead of a Soviet style violent revolution. Its not just the media and educational system either. Theyve also taken over our entertainment industry and increasingly religious institutions.

If your idea of “defeating Marxists” basically equates to embracing fascism, you are no more a friend to this republic than the Marxists are.



To: sodpoodle

I agree with that in some ways. I’ve never quite come down on which I prefer because both have their advantages. Acting properly socially is very important, so I am quite uncomfortable with separating the sexes in total. They need to be able to interact in an improving manner as they go through puberty. I might favor a mixed school with segregated classes more. Guys like to cut up to get attention, and girls want to study for the most part. That might work out best. Thanks for the mention. I do like a very strong adult presence for kids during this age, but they have to be taught to think and act independently too, so the supervision needs to recede at at some point. Juniors and seniors in high school are generally accorded some increased responsibilities and decision making, so it probably works out.
