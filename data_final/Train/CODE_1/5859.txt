Americans pleas for help in Sudan ignored

American Thinker ^ | August 18, 2016 | Carol Brown

Posted on by detective

Obama ushered in a new age of evil. Hillary Clinton will follow suit. Heres a recent snapshot of just how depraved things have become (as if we need more examples).

The AP recently reported on a four-hour rampage of violence directed against Americans (and others) in South Sudan when Sudanese troops attacked a residential compound last month.

The soldier pointed his AK-47 at the female aid worker and gave her a choice.

Either you have sex with me, or we make every man here rape you and then we shoot you in the head, she remembers him saying.

She didn't really have a choice. By the end of the evening, she had been raped by 15 South Sudanese soldiers.

These are the people Obama is bring over as so called "refugees." Obama is paying to bring them to America.



To: detective

Yes, Obama is covered in American blood and glories in it every day as he lines up his next putt. More death and destruction, more Jihadis being brought in to subjugate Americans, Obama is the greatest threat to the US.



To: detective

Obama is raping us. Then he will kill us off with these invaders.

To: detective

We shouldn’t have any aid workers in those Third World cesspools. Let them die. Fewer we have to kill in the next war. When they come after us over here, we should flatten a few cities, poison their wells, and destroy their food supplies and cut off their medicines.



To: detective

This is why Obonzo and Clintoon are pimping “Australian-style” gun confiscation so hard. There are too many Americans in America and they want to cull the herd of those who refuse to toe their communist government line.

Don’t forget “What’s Her Name” who is vowing to continue the policies and programs of “You Know Who”.

Those being let in are NOT refugees, they are an invading army. In other words, the “SS” in civies is still the “SS”.

This must end, or we do.

Indeed, what is the U.S. interest, other than workers who shouldn’t be allowed to be there in the first place? Who’s sons and daughters in our military should we send over? I’d wager it won’t be the author’s.



To: detective

Obama is an emanation of the will of his voters. His voters live amongst us .....

Problem that.



To: Wolfie

It’s these aid and relief workers who think they can change the world. We should stop giving aid, money, and ban all travel to Africa. Eff ‘em.



To: IWontSubmit

Special Forces had to get my cousins daughter out of there a couple of years ago..she was working for the state dept..



To: Extremely Extreme Extremist

Or stop paying the UN. If their “peacekeeping” forces won’t respond, as happened here, then why bother with them?



To: detective

Aren’t these non-muslims in South Sudan? I looked it up the other day, after the articles about rapes by South Sudenese forces.

We have to have at least a few aid workers there to provide cover for Cheryl Mills and The Witch to send a few percent of the billions they rake in. Otherwise it would not be charity but pure money laundering.

Anyone ever wonder why it is most of these atrocities see to be always aimed at Americans? Could it be other nations, who seem to be uninclined in the first place to offer aid and whose citizens do not volunteer for these missions of mercy and enlightenment, take assaults and killings of their citizens as an act of aggression against their citizens?? Recall how in history being a Roman citizen guaranteed you free passage about the western world and whoa be it to someone who did you harm. IMO, you cannot bargain with evil. Faced with it you have two choices: withdraw or remove them from the planet.

Was chatting with someone who returned from deployment to one of those known hell holes yesterday. He said it was kind of amusing. They have a democracy of sorts and even a two party system. The two party system is the ins and the outs. If you support anyone from the outside party, you are subject to arrest for being against the party in power which has coincidentally been in power since the “democracy” was founded. Of course we support the “democratically elected” government. Why, because they are against the even worse regime across the waterway.

These aid workers could be aiding the homeless and poor in any urban center in the USA.

I just watched the movie Machine Gun Preacher the other day. It's about the ex biker turned preacher Sam Childers from Pennsylvania. He goes to Sudan to help Christians fight off the moslum aggressors.

South Sudan, Benghazi, what difference does it make!!



To: Georgia Girl 2

Very well said. White are Americans there?

Unless they can provide 10 heavily armed soldiers for every aid work, get the f#$% out!

Why do we piss away tax dollars on this crap.



To: No_More_Harkin

Any female US aid worker heading for Africa should be required to sign a form stating they understand they may be gang raped, tortured and/or killed during their stint in the region. They call Africa “the dark continent” for a reason. It is a lost cause. We need to stay out of there and leave these people to their misery. And keep them from coming to the US.

Great movie, as an ex infanteer, I’m tempted to do the same.



To: peeps36

I watched that on Netflix. Great movie.
