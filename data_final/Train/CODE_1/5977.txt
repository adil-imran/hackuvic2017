Why Poland would spend money on army?

It have protection of NATO

for God's Sake.

No one will mess with Nato.

Putin is just a Barking Dog.

He bully Ukraine because they are isolated.

Poland should make like Israel

Invest in research and education and then in the future will have their own advanced military industry.

From the point of view of philosophy, you must be right.because the world in which we live have its rules, objective and subjective.Poland don`t have protection of NATO. You know, those who invited Poland to NATO didn`t do it because of their altruistic nature. Plus, in NATO leading countries live magnates who generation by generation used to use Poland and Poles.Let`s not use name of God here. Its useless useNATO itself is problem of itself. That is the greatest threat of being in NATO.From all sentences here this sentence is closest to be truth. Its because, we can say whatever we want about politicians and they are still just that- politicians. Still, this way or another, they are reality and one have to be aware of it.`Ukraine and Putin` is wrong example. Any Russian leader of any time would have to do something similar if found itself in similar position, as it is Putin`s now. From the historical perspective, one can hardly blame Russia for the events in Ukraine. Blame goes on the west of Europe and USA.Poland isn`t Israel.Nice and noble ideas. But first, go kindly ask leaders and magnates of the west of Europe and USA that they allow Poland to change its meaning of existence. It is them who deciding what would be Poland`s orientation and role in this world.
