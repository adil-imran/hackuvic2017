Why isnt the Liberal Media Asking Why Hillary Clinton isnt Visiting Louisiana?

AIM ^ | August 24, 2016 | Spencer Irvine

Posted on by detective

Donald Trump pre-empted the liberal media criticism of Republicans not caring about people by visiting last week, which even preceded sitting President Barack Obama. Obama waited up to ten days to visit flood-damaged Baton Rouge, with little criticism from the media, while George W. Bush was criticized for responding to Hurricane Katrina after three days.

But, where is Hillary Clinton in all this? She tweeted support and the like for the people of Baton Rouge, but Trump visited and brought donations for the displaced residents of Baton Rouge. There were no feature articles asking this question on ABC News, CBS News, CNN or NBC News website.

Another failure by the corrupt and biased media.



To: detective

Because there aren’t any ramps and handrails....that’s why. She’s napping.



To: detective

Hillary has answered that question. It would be a distraction to the workers. Which is what Bush said when he flew over and was vilified for the rest of his term and probably the rest of his life.



To: detective

Fox reported yesterday that she’s going “when things settle down”.



To: detective

Sorry, all she could muster this week was a 5 minute appearance on Kimmel. Then they put her back in her sarcophagus and went home.



To: Gaffer

Exactly. Can’t roll a wheelchair through water.



To: detective

Don’t bother the Queen of the USA... She’s awesome .../heavy sarcasm



To: dowcaet

I picture her out of camera shot from the press as being wheeled around on a pair of hand trucks like Hannibal Lecter - minus the gimp mask, of course.



To: detective

Let's face it. Even the MSM is strongly noticing that Hillary is NOT making enough public appearances of the type Trump has done in his rallies. This is why literally EVERYTHING is on the line with that public rally this Thursday in Las Vegas, NV--and even that won't quiet skeptics because she's done way too few of these rallies in the first place.

It’s an interesting point. She can fly cross country, to go yuk it up with late night comedians, and open a jar of pickles, but can’t head on down to Louisiana to make an appearance. Maybe irrelevant, but I saw the devastation and people affected by the flooding. And almost all were white people. Hmmm..... White folks in a “red” state such as Louisiana??? Just noting how the media created a firestorm over Hurricane Katrina because so many victims then were black, and that meant Bush and Republicans were racist, etc.

Expect Bill or Chelsea to show up any day now



To: Gaffer

LOL. Good one. I just watched a PBS documentary they did on JFK a few years back, and it showed footage of him being lowered off Air Force One by an elevator lift and walking to his helicopter with use of crutches because of his back problems. The press knew all about JFK’s health problems as well as FDR’s paralysis, but never reported it. For them to cover up Hillary’s health problems would be nothing new.

Why isnt the Liberal Media Asking Why Hillary Clinton isnt Visiting Louisiana? Whats the point, They are Not Going to Give her any MONEY so Why would she even consider going.??

Simple ... they don’t want to make their candidate look bad.

To: detective

She can’t or won’t go because she just might get cornered and have to answer a few questions.

Good point but Trump proved otherwise. Very neatly so.

Emails Show Hillary Didnt Feel Well Enough To Fly Commercial, Requested Air Force Fly Her Home http://www.weaselzippers.us/291209-emails-show-hillary-didnt-feel-well-enough-to-fly-commercial-requested-air-force-fly-her-home/



To: KeyLargo

I saw that. Imagine her in a bunker forced to direct and command our forces when she needs a diaper change, more medication and IVs or a shot of whatever the hell booster drug they give her so she can perform for an hour. It’s damned scary that is. Really.



To: detective

Simple, They are protecting her, as usual. One note. Someone mentioned that all of the flood victims were white. Not true. The area does have a numerous black population. I lived there in the 80’s, not far from the Sorrento sign shown in some of the pictures aired recently. Dated a girl in Sorrento. I frequently visited a black friend in a black neighborhood, called Doc by everyone (I have no idea why and never asked) and drove through some of the black areas of Baton rouge itself a few times, usually on the way to play with various bands. There is a black neighborhood in most all of the outlying areas, and in Baton Rouge proper too. The area Trump visited is about a 10 minute drive from Baton Rouge proper, then it was pretty empty but now it’s hard to tell when Baton rouge stops and Gonzales starts. Denham Springs is only a couple of miles away, Sorrento maybe 5 or 6 miles, and several other areas - Laplace, Sorrento, Denham Springs, Gonzales, St Amant...From Gonzales, new Orleans is straight down I-10 about 45 minutes. I lived in and around Gonzales and Denham Springs for about 5 or 6 years. Lived in Denham Springs and Baton Rouge a couple of times as a kid, went to 6th grade in Baton Rouge. So this area is basically home to me, or was at one time, and it sucks to see Obama and Hillary both pretty much ignoring people that were my friends for a long time. And not all of them were white...

The Ministry of Propaganda (aka the press corps) refuses to allow any story which reflects badly on her royal highness, queen hillary.



To: detective

They deliberately and intentionally said very little about Trump’s visit, but continually hyped bammy’s visit. They are giving Her Royal Hipness a free pass on this.



To: butlerweave

“Expect Bill or Chelsea to show up any day now.” No, Bill is too feeble and befuddled and Chelsea is too arrogant.

Boycotts may not hurt them, but their infrastructure is another story.
