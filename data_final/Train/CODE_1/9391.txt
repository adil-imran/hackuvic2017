Massacre

In this 2015 photo provided by the Bostonian Society, costumed actors perform a reading of "Blood on the Snow" in the Council Chamber of the Old State House in Boston. The play, inspired by the 1770 British slaughter of American colonists, will be presented to the public from May 12-29, 2016, in the very same room where the colonists agonized over how to respond to the killings, now known as the Boston Massacre.
