Reports: Russia gives Syria green light to shoot down Israeli planes

World Israel News ^ | September 15, 2016

Posted on by Lera

After Israel attacked the Assad regime's military positions in response to projectiles fired from Syria that exploded inside Israel, Russia called on Israel to show restraint and has allegedly given Syria permission to shoot down Israeli planes that cross into its territory.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has called on Israel to "show restraint" and to "avoid any provocations" in the Syrian Golan Heights.

"There is the need to show restraint and not to allow any provocations in the Golan Heights," Lavrov said commenting on an airstrike carried out by the Israeli jets in Syria's Golan Heights on Tuesday, according to the Russian TASS news agency.

Israel has carried out several airstrike against the Assad regime's military positions in recent days in response to projectiles fired from Syria that exploded inside Israel. At least 11 projectiles have exploded in Israel in the past two weeks - spillover from the Syrian civil war being waged along Israel's northern border.

Despite President Bashar al-Assad's multiple crimes against his country committed over the course of five years of warfare, Russia has offered close support to his regime and has sent military forces to support his retreating army, even at the cost of Russian lives.

Lavrov posited that the situation in the Golan Heights reflects the overall destabilization of the Middle East and the growing terrorist threat that needs to be countered.

It’s not like the Israeli air force has not met such a challenge before, though.

“————has allegedly given Syria permission to shoot down Israeli planes that cross into its territory. “ Allegedly !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Who knows if it’s true. .

not good, but I do NOT believe Putin would be so stupid as to do that for one thing, Putin has a working agreement with Jerusalem concerning this matter, and its been working just fine for both and Syria’s air force is a joke ... anything being possible, they maybe might be able to score a hit on the IDF but if they ever did, they’d be dead ducks and they know it (Putin knows even his own very good air force could not defeat the Israelis, and its among the very last ways he wants to waste his military resources ....) I think this report is just more of the smoke that gets blown during wartime operations. we will see

Great, not, for sure. The world awaits its false messiah Antichrist with a 7-year “peace” plan dividing Israel and celebrating “3 great faiths” via the False Prophet.

He is trying to force a peace deal

He wants to control the area

Don’t put anything past him .

I think Putin might try something like that someday but right now he has his hands VERY busy fighting the Moslem terrorists ...

he can’t afford to screw around with more Moslem terrorists than the ones he already has to contend with in Syria and inside Russia we will see what the future may bring, tho.....

Some Russians included in that 86. There was lots of radio chatter in Russian, and I doubt they were immigrants from Russia who had the skill to fly MIGs.

To: Lera

Well, they can try. The Syrians ought to carefully consider that though. The Israelis retaliated for being fired upon. The Russian advice is to fire at them more? They start engaging the aircraft, that will probably open up the ROE for the IAF. Syria stands to lose a lot of air defense assets.

To: faithhopecharity

Yes, Israel does have the finest air force in the world. The thing I worry about though is the Russian S-400 systems deployed in Syria. I highly doubt Syrian forces have control of those S-400 batteries though. What could happen in the near future if Obama keeps hitting the Syrian forces though is Putin announcing a no-fly zone over Syria. This would cause a showdown that would lead to US warplanes being destroyed by the S-400. WW3

Thanks for the link :-)

WWIII because we are supporting jihadis who are trying to overthrow a secular government and install sharia. Sick and disgusting that we now fight FOR the very ideology that attacked us on 9/11.

To: DesertRhino

Yup, Obama is on the side of the Muslim Brotherhood. This is the problem. We have no right to be causing havoc in Syria. Obama wants the MB in charge in Syria so they can build the pipeline to Europe.

Totally disgusting

None of them are good guys though

i hate to point this out but

if US planes were shot down in Syria...(where they do NOT belong to begin with!!! O is running an illegal war against another country just like he did against Libya and Somalia and and and and?)

anyway,

if a few of our nice pilots got shot down, Obama would just go play more golf no WW3

Pastor JDs update this week is on how Russia is trying to force Israel into a peace deal with the fakestinians ...

That was an informative presentation. Thanks. That was an informative presentation. Thanks. We are up the dirty a creek without a paddle. Thanks Obama and Hillary. The powers that be in the US want a war with Russia. Russia has promised that in such a case, they will nuke the US rather than fight a ground war over in the Ukraine or anywhere else. They may not have an army to beat the US but they do have lots of nukes and won’t hesitate to use them. Hillary has threatened war with Russia during this election over actions like cyber attacks - which is insane. Obama has ruined US diplomatic power. If Trump wins, he has to start over at zero.

I think Putin will end up having us nuked via North Koria - Chinese proxy or directly himself.

Obama wants the Muslim Brotherhood running all of the Middle East.

A lot of noise here. Russia is fighting the Islamic State created by those who oppose Assad’s regime including but not limited to the Gulf Arabs, the Saudis, the EU, NATO countries, the US as in Obama, Clinton, McCain etc. etc. and yes, Israel, too. Israel has consistently used its military forces against Assad’s regime from time to time because taking out Assad would deny the Iranians an ally and base to attack Israel from. All those who have opposed Assad and undermined his government and supporters have helped create the anarchy in the country that led to the Islamic State being created.
