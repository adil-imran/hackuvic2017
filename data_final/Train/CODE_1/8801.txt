From Uche Nnorom, Makurdi

The Conference of Minority Tribes, CMT, in Nigeria has tasked the federal government to take decisive action against the alleged Fulani crisis in Benue and all other religious related issues across the country.

The group which made the demand during a peaceful protest in Makurdi, Benue state capital yesterday, condemned the wanton killings in Agatu and all other parts of the state even as they frowned at claims that the crisis was purely over grazing rights.

Leader of the group, Comrade Okpokwu Ogenyi described the current crisis as an “ethnic cleansing” exercise which has erroneously labelled Fulani-Agatu crisis to desensitize national consciousness.

He therefore, demands the federal government to institute a probe into the killings and investigate the reason why Fulani herdsmen were allowed to allegedly traverse freely with sophisticated weapons contrary as against the law.

“The on-going ethnic cleansing has been mischievously labelled Fulani-Agatu crisis under circumstances that are at best efforts to desensitize the national consciousness to the enormity of the scale on which Benue state people are being wiped-out on a daily basis.” Okpokwu said.

The group also requested the Federal Government to provide compensation and relief to the victims of the invasion, so as to alleviate their hardship.
