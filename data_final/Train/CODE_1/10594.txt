The United Nations released a statement revealing that the Saudi airstrikes in Yemen's capital, Saana, had killed at least 140 people and injuring a further 525.

Although the statement acknowledged that "violence against civilians in Yemen must immediately stop", it not once mentioned Saudi Arabia in the document as seen below.
