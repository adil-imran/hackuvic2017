Handwara: Handwara paid homage to the 17 civilians who had been massacred on January 25, 1990 by Border Security Force soldiers during a demonstration against the slaughter of 50 unarmed protesters in Gaw Kadal, Srinagar, four days earlier.

Member of Legislative Assembly form Langate constituency Engineer Rashid led a protest march from the Environmental Hall in Handwara town to the main square, where they visited the martyrs graveyard and offered prayers to the deceased.

Imam of local Jamia mosque Mufti Manzoor Ahmad Kirmani led the prayers.

Addressing a gathering at the Hall, Rashid said January 25 massacre was one of the worst carnages in the area. He demanded a fresh investigation into the incident and severe punishment to the killers.

He also demanded that the army camp in the town should be removed to avoid any “untoward incident in future”.

“Indian army has also established a check point on Kupwara-Rajwar road just like a Wagah Border, where soldiers search every vehicle and passenger,” he said, while warning that people of Handwara will demonstrate on streets if the check post is not removed.

The Handwara Traders Federation and the Transport Association had called for a complete shutdown in the town. Amid the presence of a large number of government forces, the town observed a complete shutdown.
