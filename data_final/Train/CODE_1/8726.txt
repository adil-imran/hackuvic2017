Two people accused of plotting to attack the Halifax Shopping Centre on Valentine's Day 2015 will go to trial next year to face one charge each of conspiracy to commit murder.

Lindsay Kanitha Souvannarath and Randall Steven Shepherd made a brief appearance in Nova Scotia Supreme Court this morning to discuss the progress of their case. They will go on trial in May and June 2017.

The pair have been in custody since they were arrested on Feb. 13, 2015, just hours before they were to allegedly attack the mall. They're facing a variety of charges, but today lawyers confirmed the case will focus on the conspiracy to commit murder charge.

A hearing has been scheduled for late September to discuss what evidence can be used at trial. The voir dire — a hearing to decide on the admissibility of evidence where the jury isn't present — is scheduled to run for two weeks.

Much of the evidence involves online postings.

A third suspect, James Gamble, was found dead at his parents' home the day before Souvannarath and Shepherd were arrested. Gamble left behind a blog filled with images of death, shootings and references to the 1999 Columbine High School massacre in Colorado, Adolf Hitler and Nazis.
