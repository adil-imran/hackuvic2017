Suspec­ted terror­ist was also involv­ed in Safoor­a bus attack­

KARACHI: A suspected militant wanted in a number of terrorism cases, including the Safoora Goth massacre, was arrested in Karachi on Thursday.

Law enforcement agencies arrested Ali Rehmani alias Tona during an intelligence-based operation in Pipri on the outskirts of Karachi. The suspect was inspired by the Middle Eastern Islamic State terrorist group – also known by its Arabic acronym of Da’ish.

Rehmani was wanted in a number of terrorism cases, including the Safoora Goth attack of May 2015. He is a proclaimed offender in the bus attack case as well as in the murder of social rights’ activist Sabeen Mehmud.

Both the cases have been transferred to a military court for trial and it is unclear whether the suspect would be handed over to the army or will remain in the custody of law enforcement agencies.

Rehmani is said to be one of the assailants who boarded the Ismaili community bus in Safoora Goth and opened fire on its passengers. Around 45 people, including 18 women, were killed in the attack.

Rehmani’s arrest has, however, not been officially confirmed yet by police or Rangers.

While the authorities have time and again refuted reports of the presence of Da’ish in Pakistan, a number of suspects, including women, inspired by Da’ish have been rounded up in recent months across the country.

Last September in Karachi, a businessman having links with the Syria-based terror outfit was picked up by the counter-terrorism police.

The suspect later revealed the presence of a cell working for Da’ish in the city and his revelations led to some more arrests.
