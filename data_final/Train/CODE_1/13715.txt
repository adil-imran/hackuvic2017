Russia calls for immediate cease-fire in Yemen [16/يناير/2016]





MOSCOW, Jan. 16 (Saba) – The Russian Foreign Ministry has described the Saudi-led coalition massacres in Yemen as horrific, calling for an immediate ceasefire and engaging in negations without preconditions.



The Russian Foreign Ministry’s spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told a news conference in Moscow that despite the positive signals made by the negotiations between the Yemeni opposing parties in Geneva last December, but the armed confrontation in this country are still continuing, especially after the Saudi-led coalition announced the end of the truce and resumed the military operations.



" In recent days the media circulated horrible news about the Saudi-led coalition bombing on a MSF-supported hospital in Sa’ada, which resulted in deaths and injuries," she added.



In this regard, the spokeswoman explained that the information received from Yemen referred to the killing of thousands of civilians including women and children. She called for putting an end to this horrible acts and resuming the negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations.
