MRC President Brent Bozell Calls on Conservatives Across the Country to Protest Left-Wing Media

Newsbusters ^ | 10/11/2016 | NB Staff

Posted on by God luvs America

Statement by Brent Bozell: "The leftist media are out of control and the American people know it and are furious. These so-called 'news' journalists are doing everything in their power to AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION. In 30 years I've never seen anything like this. Protesters went to the CNN affiliate in Hollywood to protest, and at least one was assaulted. Enough is enough. We have never done this before, but we are calling on people to organize and publicly protest against their local network 'news' affiliates around the country. The media will never hold themselves accountable, so now it's up to the people to rise and protest. And if any protester is assaulted again, conservatives have every right to defend themselves appropriately."

Sheeesh... it would have taken less words to just say ALL media since to say ‘leftwing media’ is redundant....

Only all out war against the establishment and MSM will change the system. Whether it begins with civil disobedience, withdrawal of financial resources or boycotts, lawsuits at every level, etc. the time to reject these anti-Americans and enemies of free citizens has arrived.

No TV here since 1997. I can’t boycott.

A meaningful protest would be to cut the cord and stop paying cable TV fees. There are plenty of other ways to get media content these days. A ridiculous amount of those fees go to subsidize ESPN and other Leftist media outlets.



To: God luvs America

Brent is saying to get in their face and to fight back if assaulted. Stock up on pepper spray and record everything that happens. Hold the spray in one hand and the camera phone in another. Better yet have a partner hold the spray and camera while the other does the talking and protesting.

Now that’s what I’m talking about.



To: God luvs America

I’ve got a few cool ideas for playing YouTube audio into my phone for the weekly Sound Off column in the local newspapers: Play 30 second sound bites of conservative ideas by noteworthy people. Just hold my cell phone up to the laptop speakers and then tell them where I’m calling from. That and maybe find some good stuff where prominent liberals exhibit their double standards.

“MRC President Brent Bozell Calls on Conservatives Across the Country to Protest Left-Wing Media” -—Yeah right LOL IF people on FR can’t stop watching Megyn Kelly & FOX then I doubt very seriously you’ll get poeple to actually stop watching lib media



To: God luvs America

Wasn’t Brent Bozell a #NeverTrumper who signed that angry open letter? Maybe he’s starting to understand why Trump is so popular.



To: God luvs America

How about this: If Hillary wins cancel television and stop going to movies. I may do it anyway as I’m tired of having my beliefs ridiculed daily.



To: God luvs America

A better tactic would be to punk them with false tips. Go to the on scene (hopefully live) reporting walk behind the report and unfold a sign. Or...offer to comment and go on a rant about them.

” Brent Bozell Calls on Conservatives Across the Country to Protest Left-Wing Media” The situation is way past “protesting” the left-wing media. It’s time to recognize these pigs as neo-Nazi propagandists.
