Dr. James Tracy, a communications professor at Florida Atlantic University who believes the Sandy Hook massacre to be a hoax propagated by the federal government, was fired from his teaching position after he harassed parents of Sandy Hook victims and accused them of being government agents, reports the Washington Post. According to the university’s vague press release, Tracy was issued a notice of termination yesterday, which followed up the notice of proposed termination he was sent on December 16. He’s fired as of this coming Friday.

A major factor in Tracy’s firing was an op-ed in the Sun Sentinel by Lenny and Veronique Pozner, whose 6-year-old son, Noah, was shot and killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012. The couple wrote that Tracy sent them a certified letter demanding proof that Noah had lived, and that when they refused to respond, he blasted them on his blog and accused them of accepting government payoffs to feign grief. In an angry Facebook post, Tracy wrote that the Pozners’ op-ed was an attempt to “intimidate his employer into firing him” because of the “extensive research” he’d done on the Sandy Hook shooting. “The Pozners, alas, are as phony as the drill itself, and profiting handsomely from the fake death of their son,” he wrote.
