For the past five decades, Palestinian intellectual, Abu Sitta was on a mission to rebuild the map of historic Palestine in an immense body of indisputable evidence and facts

In his memoir, Mapping My Return: A Palestinian Memoir, published last month, Abu Sitta chronicles the dispossession of the Palestinian homeland, by British and Jewish terrorists.

From a child of Nakba, at the age of 10, Salman Abu Sitta, 77, grew into the Keeper of the Keys of Return for seven million Palestinian refugees.

“They took my home by brute force and made me a refugee and I want my home back, and I want to live in it in freedom and dignity,” Abu Sitta told Al Jazeera.

The 1948 Nakba saw the ethnic cleansing of 530 Palestinian villages. 750,000 villagers, who survived the massacres, were torn from their ancestral roots

Abu Sitta is an engineer and author. He was a member of the Palestine National Council, is the general coordinator of the Right of Return Congress and Founder and President of the Palestine Land Society.

“In all the research I made, I did not find a moral, legal, demographic, historical or geographical reason why I should be and remain a refugee,” he said.

“Our plan is to reconstruct the destroyed Palestinian villages,” he said.
