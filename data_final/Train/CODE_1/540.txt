European Spacecraft Prepares to Land on Mars Next Week

Launched on March 14, the ExoMars mission rocketed two connected spacecraft, the Trace Gas Orbiter and its Schiaparelli lander, toward Mars. The two spacecraft are expected to separate on Sunday (Oct. 16), and if all goes according to plan, the Schiaparelli lander will descend on the Martian surface three days later. While the Schiaparelli lander is on the Martian surface, the Trace Gas Orbiter will orbit the Red Planet and study its atmosphere. The Schiaparelli spacecraft is set to land in Mars' Meridiani Planum region, close to the planet's equator. It will enter the Martian atmosphere at about 13,000 mph (21,000 km/h) and will have 6 minutes to brake to a safe speed for landing, ESA officials said in a statement.

To ensure the challenging descent goes according to plan, the lander's sensors will monitor its height above the Martian surface, starting at 4 miles (7 kilometers). When the spacecraft is about 6.5 feet (2 meters) above the surface, it will hover for a moment, cut its thrusters and fall freely to the ground, as shown in the video. [at the link]

No landing gear, it just "plops" down on what they call a crushable buffer structure. Then it just sits there. We send VEHICLES that roam around for YEARS... USA... USA..üóΩ
