Description Inside Amy Schumer head writer and executive producer Jessi Klein offers a relentlessly funny yet poignant take on the rites of modern femininity, hilariously and candidly exploring the journey of the twenty-first century woman. The author of the essay collection You’ll Grow Out of It and the writer behind many of the most popular Inside Amy Schumer skits, including the “Last F***able Day” sketch, Klein strives beyond mere chuckles, also offering a more thorough accounting of what it means to be a woman in the world today.



Jessi Klein is the Emmy and Peabody award-winning head writer and an executive producer of Comedy Central's critically acclaimed series Inside Amy Schumer. She's also written for Amazon's Transparent as well as Saturday Night Live. She has been featured on the popular storytelling series The Moth and has been a regular panelist on NPR's Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me! She's been published in Esquire and Cosmopolitan, and has had her own half-hour Comedy Central stand-up special.



Chris Colin is an author of three books, including most recently What to Talk About, and has written about chimp filmmakers, ethnic cleansing, George Bush’s pool boy, solitary confinement and more for the New Yorker, the New York Times Magazine, Saveur, Pop-Up Magazine, Outside, Wired, McSweeney’s, Mother Jones and more. He’s a contributing writer for California Sunday Magazine and teaches writing at the San Francisco Writers’ Grotto.



"You’ll Grow Out of It does an amazing job making me understand what my life might be like if I were a woman. Or if I were Jessi Klein. I laughed. Lots. Not at what it's like to be a woman! That would be sexist. I laughed at the parts that you're supposed to. Which are plentiful. Because Jessi Klein is truly really funny."
