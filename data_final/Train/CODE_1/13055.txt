At least 1,000 indigenous people traveled to Puerto Narino, a village on the Amazon River, to participate in the Colombian Amazon Games. The competition included boat racing, swimming in piranha-infested waters, arching and blowpipe throwing. This was all part of a collective effort to celebrate traditions that date back to pre-Columbian times. Correspondent Toby Muse attended the Amazon Games and filed this report for Americas Now.

This arm-swinging Turkish folk dance is done to Kazim Koyuncu's music with its powerful beat and inspiring vocal. On a difficulty scale of 1-5 with 5 being most difficult, it would rate it a 2. Note that one of the dancers thought the dance had ended when, in fact, it had just a few more seconds to completion. The missing dance portion consists only of a continuation of the basic step with arm-swinging, not "windshield-wiping."
