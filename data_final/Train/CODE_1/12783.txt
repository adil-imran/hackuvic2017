The Paris based charity, Action Contre la Faim on Thursday called for a credible investigation into the killing of 17 of its local aid workers in Muttur in Sri Lanka in 2006.

Visiting Sri Lanka on the 10th anniversary of the killing, the ACF chief executive, Veronique Andrieux told AFP that they were closely observing the government's implementation of the UN Human Rights Council resolution calling for a credible investigation into mass atrocities committed during the armed conflict.

"What we hope is that this accountability mechanism will be able to deliver a credible legal and just solution," Andrieux told AFP.

"We are awaiting concrete steps in the right direction. It is now time for action."
