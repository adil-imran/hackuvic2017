The Belgian capital Brussels has been hit by bomb attacks five weeks before it is set to host the world’s largest seafood trade fair, Seafood Expo Global.

On Tuesday, there have been two explosions at the city’s Zaventem airport and another blast at the Maalbeek metro station, which is close to the main European Union buildings.

The Belgian government has raised the terror level to four across the country, the highest level. All public transport has since been suspended, and the Eurostar is no longer stopping in the city's Brussels Midi teminal. All EU meetings have been cancelled.

According to Belgian broadcaster VRT, cited by the BBC, which is posting live updates on the aftermath of the incident, at least 26 people have been killed in the attacks.

Seafood Expo Global, which runs from April 26-28 this year, was attended by 26,600 in 2015.

Diversified Communications, the US-based company that runs the show, were not immediately available for comment to Undercurrent News.

Even before the attacks, Belgium was on high alert after the capture Salah Abdeslam, believed to be the only surviving participant of the November massacre in Paris that left 130 people dead.

Abdeslam faces a Brussels court decision on Wednesday on whether to extend a Belgian arrest warrant issued on Saturday, reports Bloomberg.
