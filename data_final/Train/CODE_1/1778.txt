Home! - Russian officials and deputies advised to return the children and parents home

Russian officials, up to the highest level, it is recommended to return to the country of children studying abroad. And to do so without waiting for the end of the study, and by shifting offspring in Russian universities. At home, parents should also return to officials and deputies, if the older generation of the family for some reason resides abroad without losing the citizenship of the Russian Federation, told Znak.com just five companions whom informal request from the presidential administration are most directly affected.

The recommendation will apply to all: from the staff of the administration as well as regional administrations, to deputies of all levels. Do not escape the new duties even employees of public corporations. Those who wait to the implementation of tacit request, reminded of the already known when the next of kin of the stay of the younger or the older generation abroad became a complicating factor in subsequent career in the public sector, said one of the interlocutors. According to him, in recent months it has become aware of several such cases. "In this situation, the time is offered to resolve the issue, but in the case of failure to do so hiring, which is expected to place the applicant in the civil service, there is no" - led example of the source Znak.com.

Varying severity of scandals related to the fact that the children of the Russian political elite are educated abroad, while their parents on television talking about patriotism and "surrounded by enemies", in recent years become permanent. In 2012, Alexei Navalny in his blog published information that the students abroad all three daughters Zheleznyaka Sergei, a prominent member of the faction "United Russia" in the State Duma. Abroad he was educated and stayed the son of Senator Elena Mizulina - however, his return did not even get it.

Russian government reportedly orders it's citizen's living aboard, to return. This may very well be a political stunt to bolster distrust that western countries have a bad influence on Russian students. Or this could be a chest beating stunt to make the west / America think Russian is preparing for war. Or it Could be that they actually Are preparing for war. 1. Sept: Russia reactivated dozens of emergency shortwave frequencies for it's national emergency radio service. 2. Sept 27: Russia withdraws from mutual Plutonium reclamation agreements. 3. Oct 4-7: Russia conducts Cold-war Era Civil Defense drill involving 40 Million citizens. 4.

Now this development on the heels of reported Pentagon reports that the USA may target Assad's forces via cruise missile attack. Very Bad idea idea to tweek the bear's nose repeatedly.

Zero Hedge - Russian Government Officials Told To Immediately Bring Back Children Studying Abroad Oct 11, 2016 5:02 PM In Europe, when it gets serious, you have to lie... at least if you are an unelected bureaucrat like Jean-Claude Juncker. In Russia, however, when it gets serious, attention immediately turns to the children. Which is why we read a report in Russian website Znak published Tuesday, according to which Russian state officials and government workers were told to bring back their children studying abroad immediately, even if means cutting their education short and not waiting until the end of the school year, and re-enroll them in Russian schools, with some concern. The article adds that if the parents of these same officials also live abroad “for some reason”, and have not lost their Russian citizenship, should also be returned to the motherland. Znak cited five administration officials as the source of the report. The “recommendation” applies to all: from the administration staff, to regional administratiors, to lawmakers of all levels. Employees of public corporations are also subject to the ordinance. One of the sources said that anyone who fails to act, will find such non-compliance to be a “complicating factor in the furtherance of their public sector career.” He added that he was aware of several such cases in recent months. It appears that the underlying reason behind the command is that the Russian government is concerned about the optics of having children of the Russian political elite being educated abroad, while their parents appear on television talking about patriotism and being “surrounded by enemies.” While we doubt the impacted children will be happy by this development, some of the more patriotic locals, if unimpacted, are delighted. Such as Vitaly Ivanov, a political scientist who believes that the measure to return children of officials from studying abroad, is “long overdue.” According Ivanoc, the education of children of the Russian elite abroad is subject to constant ridicule and derision against the ruling regime. “People note the hypocrisy of having a centralized state and cultivating patriotism and anti-Western sentiment, while children of government workers study abroad. You can not serve two gods, one must choose.” On the other hand, political analyst Stanislav Belkovsky quoted by Znak, believes that such decisions should be approached with more pragmatism. Such a recommendation is more likely to lead to an outflow of officials from the state, rather than allow the return of the children studying at elite foreign universities. He also warned of attempts to recreate an echo chamber such as that experienced after the failed July coup attempt on Turkey’s President Erdogan. But what he said next was more disturbing: “On the one hand, this is all part of a package of measures to prepare the elites for some ‘big war’ even if it is rather conditional, on the other hand - this is another blow to the unity of President Putin with his own elite” Belkovsky said. He adds that the Western sanctions launcedh in March 2014, had sought to drive a wedge between Putin and elites. In response, the Kremlin began to act precisely according to the logic of these sanctions. “But while a ban for having assets in the West is one thing, and understanable, when it comes to a ban for offshore health and education services, the blowback will be far greater, as it represents a far more important element of the establishment’s life strategy.” Ultimately the motivation behind Putin’s decision is unclear: whether it is to show Russia’s high-ranking oligarchs who is boss, to boost a sense of patriotism among the nation by sending a symbolic message that the west is no longer a welcome destination for Russia’s rich kids, or just a preemptive move of repatriating of any individuals affiliated with Russian politics for other unknown reasons; however it underscores the severity of the ongoing diplomatic crisis and just how significant the upcoming isolation between Russia and the West is likely to become in the coming months - unless of course tensions deescalate dramatically in the very near future - resulting in even greater collapse in global commerce and a further slowdown to world economic growth, which may ultimately lead to an armed conflict, whether regional or global, as the only possible outcome. http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-11/russian-government-officials-told-immediately-bring-back-children-studying-abroad

Given the perverse corruption of the U.S. government, and the corruption of our media and ruling class...I say eh..no one needs comeuppance more than our government leaders. It is terrible for those with loved ones in our military, I can’t imagine what it would be like to have them at risk defending and doing the will of the fetid rotting evil that is our government leadership. That is a terrible tragedy.

11.10.2016 Media reports that Russian officials encouraged to return home children who are studying abroad denied in the Federation Council and the Kremlin. photo: Natalia Muslinkina Several sources Znak.com told that Russian officials up to the highest level, it is recommended to return to the Russian children studying abroad. According to the publication, to return and parents are civil servants, if for any reason live far away from the homeland. This applies to all relatives of the officials having the Russian citizenship. This recommendation applies ostensibly to all officers  from the staff of the administration of the President to the deputies of all levels and employees of state-owned corporations. The fact is, the newspaper notes, that does not fit is when children gain knowledge in Western universities while their parents on television talking about patriotism and ring of enemies. Those who do not hasten to implement the recommendations will remind you of the cases where the presence of relatives abroad affected the civil service. However, this information was denied at the highest level: the Deputy head of the Federation Council Committee on regulations Vladimir Poletaev said that no such recommendations in the Federation Council has not received, RIA Novosti reported. To deny reports that such recommendations given in the Kremlin had the Kremlin itself. Press Secretary of the President Dmitry Peskov said that he first heard about it.

Russian president Vladimir Putin, who has pulled out of a visit to Paris next week after France insisted they talk about Syria But it is thought that Hollande had told the Kremlin that the only event he wanted to attend with Putin during his visit would be a ‘working meeting’ on Syria. The French president’s office then said that Moscow ‘let it be known that it wanted to postpone the trip.’ But the Kremlin hit back saying Putin is happy to go to France but only when the ‘French president is ready.’

" In Russia, however, when it gets serious, attention immediately turns to the children." "He seemed to me very independent, very serious, but at the same time a boy is always vulnerable. He was very sweet. Ill be honest: I felt an urge to squeeze him like a kitten..." Russian president Vladimir Putin, sounding like Michael Jackson "In the footage, Putin, 53, is shown walking up to a small crowd of tourists in a Kremlin courtyard and crouching down in front of the boy, who appears to be five or six years old. As the Russian president talks with Nikita for several seconds, he tugs at the boy's shirt before finally lifting it up and kissing him on his bare stomach. "He seemed to me very independent, very serious, but at the same time a boy is always vulnerable. He was very sweet. I'll be honest: I felt an urge to squeeze him like a kitten, and that led to the gesture that I made. There was nothing behind it really," Putin said, smiling. http://www.cbsnews.com/news/putin-explains-tummy-kiss/

Russia to US: If you want a confrontation, ‘you’ll get one everywhere’ 10-11-2016 http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-us-confrontation-2016-10 Russia to the US: If you want a confrontation, ‘you’ll get one everywhere’ A full year after Russia stepped into the Syrian quagmire on behalf of Syrian President Bashar Assad, Moscow has come to rival and challenge the US and NATO in virtually every arena possible. Here’s a quick glance at what Russia has accomplished just in the last month or so: Likely bombed a UN humanitarian aide convoy trying to provide relief to besieged Aleppo, derailing joint US and Russian peace talks. Continued to strike civilian targets in Syria - using chemical weapons, experts have said - exacerbating the refugee crisis in Europe. US Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove has even gone as far as to accuse Russia of purposefully attacking civilians, “weaponizing” the flow of refugees into Europe. Sent nuclear-capable missiles to Kaliningrad, Russia’s European enclave. Suspended an agreement with the US to dispose of weapons-grade plutonium because of what Russia viewed as “unfriendly” acts by the US. Sent additional missile defense batteries to Syria, and even threatened to shoot down US planes flying in Syria without warning. Participated in military drills with China in the South China Sea, where China has illegally annexed and militarized artificial islands. Likely hacked the Democratic National Committee and other US government agencies and leaked the information to the public in an effort to delegitimize the US’s upcoming election and destabilize the country at large. Without a doubt, relations between Russia and the West have reached their lowest point since the height of the Cold War. Retired Russian Lt. Gen. Evgeny Buzhinsky told the BBC that for its part, Russia sees the West as the belligerent party, citing sanctions against Russia as well as barring the Russian Paralympic team from the Rio Olympics for well-documented and state-sponsored doping as Western aggression against Russia. “Of course there is a reaction. As far as Russia sees it, as Putin sees it, it is full-scale confrontation on all fronts. If you want a confrontation, you’ll get one,” Buzhinsky told the BBC. “But it won’t be a confrontation that doesn’t harm the interests of the United States. You want a confrontation, you’ll get one everywhere.”
