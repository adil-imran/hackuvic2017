MANILA, Philippines - At least nine suspected drug pushers and users were killed in Metro Manila over the past two days as the government waged war against illegal drugs.

The 10th victim in the drug war is a barangay tanod who was shot dead while on duty in Quezon City at past midnight yesterday.

Bonifacio Fraun, 48, was active in the police’s Oplan Tokhang campaign. He was assisting in garbage collection near a school in Barangay Batasan Hills when a masked man shot him once in the head.

His sibling told police Fraun’s involvement in Oplan Tokhang could be among the motives for his murder since he had no known enemies.
