The massacre of Armenians started on this day 26 years ago and continued for a week. Those guilty for the events of 1990 have not been punished; the exact number of the victims is still unknown. What’s obvious, however, is that the real number considerably exceeds the official data.

The events in Baku 26 years ago were real genocide against the Armenian population. Tens of Armenians were killed in Baku between January 13 and 20. They were robbed of their property and exiled.

“More than a quarter of century after the massacre, the events have not been properly assessed,” President of the Assembly of Azerbaijani Armenians Grigory Ayvazyan told reporters today.

“The neighboring country glorifies the organizers and perpetrators of the crime. Even today killing an Armenia is not seen as a crime in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan brings up generations on the example of cutthroats and murderers,” he said.

“The massacre of Armenians is a serious counterargument for all those, who try to imagine Artsakh under Azerbaijani jurisdiction. In this case the reoccurrence of ethnic cleansings will be unavoidable. Remembering Baku and Sumgaint, we’ll not allow the same in Artsakh,” sociologist Aharon Adibekyan said.

According to him, the book titled “Armenophobia in Azerbaijan” will soon be released. The book, which has been translated into English, tells about the Armenian massacres in Baku and Sumgaint and their consequences. Adibekyan said “we must make it clear to the world who we have to deal with in the face of Azerbaijan.”
