BENGALURU: With arch-rival and market leader Tata Consultancy Services coming out with a strong set of June-quarter numbers, former IT sector bellwether will now be under pressure of maintaining their stellar recent run and at the least matching growth rates posted by the Mumbai-based firm.As Infosys chief executive Vishal Sikka has confidently proclaimed at recent press and investor conferences will deliver industry-leading growth rates in FY17, the company will need a rock-solid start at the very least to be able to deliver on its promise.For FY17, Infosys has forecast revenue growth in the range of 11.8-13.8% -- an ambitious prediction since Infosys will need to generates close to $1.5 billion in incremental revenue over the course of the next four quarters, at a time when India's $160-billion IT industry is witnessing its slowest rate of growth in nearly a decade.For investors in India's IT industry, Infosys's June-quarter report card will also provide crucial indicators on how other top companies such as US-based Cognizant and Wipro are likely to fare this year.Here are five things to watch out for with Infosys's results on July 15:Actual revenue growth and forecast for FY17: Infosys will need to deliver sequential revenue growth of at least 4-6% for the June quarter if the company wants a realistic shot at its ambitious full-year target.What investors will be tracking more closely is the full-year revenue guidance -- the markets will react positively if Infosys maintains its full-year prediction at the very least. In April, Infosys had indicated that it had a pipeline of about $2.8 billion in total contract value -- for Infosys to meet its numbers, the company will need to win large deals to be able translate the pipeline into actual revenues.Reshuffle in top ranks: With the exit of top Sikka lieutenant Samson David , who was recently tasked with heading the company's flagship AI platform Mana, Infosys is expected to make changes in portfolios of some of its top executives and appoint a replacement for David. Last quarter, Infosys had promoted company veterans Sandeep Dadlani, Mohit Joshi and Ravi Kumar S to the rank of presidents. Further changes are expected in the top rung. Infosys is also yet to announce a replacement for Michael Reh , who was heading the company's EdgeVerve business New investments in startups and acquisitions: As has been the trend for the past few quarters, Infosys may announce fresh investments in new-age disruptive startups or even acquisitions. As part of Sikka's 2020-strategy, Infosys has said that it wants to aggressively chase acquisitions and expects buyouts to contribute at least $2 billion in revenue over the next four years. Infosys also has a $500-million venture capital fund to invest in startups.Large deal wins: The biggest driver of performance for Infosys over the past four quarters has been its ability to win large outsourcing deals. Investors will be closely tracking the TCV that Infosys generates this quarter, as well as the number of fresh large deals that it manages to rake in.Attrition and retention of top executives: Another hallmark of the company's performance in the last few quarters has been stability across all levels of the company, which has resulted in higher incremental revenue from top customer accounts such as Bank of America, Apple and Royal Bank of Scotland. Attrition rates fell to nearly 13% in FY16 from nearly 18% in FY15. However, the company has simultaneously been hamstrung by at least five top-level executives during the course of the last 18-24 months, including that of former CFO Rajiv Bansal -- something analysts say is cause for concern. For the company to maintain its recent track record, it will need to retain key top-level executives in the near term.
