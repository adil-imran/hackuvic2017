This Day In History: Aug 27, 1776 - The Battle of Brooklyn (aka, Battle of Long Island)

various sources

Posted on by ETL

The Battle of Long Island, also known as the Battle of Brooklyn and the Battle of Brooklyn Heights, fought on August 27, 1776, was the first major battle of the American Revolutionary War to take place after the United States declared its independence on July 4, 1776. It was a victory for the British Army and the beginning of a successful campaign that gave them control of the strategically important city of New York. In terms of troop deployment and fighting, it was the largest battle of the entire war.

After defeating the British in the Siege of Boston on March 17, 1776, General George Washington, commander-in-chief, brought the Continental Army to defend the port city of New York, then limited to the southern end of Manhattan Island. Washington understood that the citys harbor would provide an excellent base for the British Navy during the campaign. There he established defenses and waited for the British to attack.

In July, the British, under the command of General William Howe, landed a few miles across the harbor from Manhattan on the sparsely-populated Staten Island, where, during the next month and a half, they were slowly reinforced by ships in Lower New York Bay, bringing their total force to 32,000 troops.

With the British fleet in control of the entrance to the harbor at the Narrows, Washington knew the difficulty in holding the city. Believing Manhattan would be the first target, he moved there the bulk of his forces.

On August 22 the British landed on the shores of Gravesend Bay in southwest Kings County, across the Narrows from Staten Island and more than a dozen miles south from the established East River crossings to Manhattan.

After five days of waiting, the British attacked American defenses on the Guan Heights. Unknown to the Americans, however, Howe had brought his main army around their rear, and attacked their flank soon after. The Americans panicked, resulting in twenty percent losses through casualties and captures, although a stand by 400 Maryland troops prevented a larger portion of the army from being lost.

The remainder of the army retreated to the main defenses on Brooklyn Heights. The British dug in for a siege but, on the night of August 2930, Washington evacuated the entire army to Manhattan without the loss of supplies or a single life.

Washington and the Continental Army were driven out of New York entirely after several more defeats, and forced to retreat through New Jersey and into Pennsylvania.

Episode 3 of the PBS video series, "The Times That Try Men's Souls", covers this chapter of the war (Battle of Brooklyn/Long Island)... LIBERTY! The American Revolution is a dramatic documentary about the birth of the American Republic and the struggle of a loosely connected group of states to become a nation. The George Foster Peabody award-winning series brings the people, events and ideas of the revolution to life through military reenactments and dramatic recreations performed by a distinguished cast.

_________________________ EPISODE 1: "The Reluctant Revolutionaries" 1763-1774

In 1763, the capitol city of America is London, George Washington is lobbying for a post in the British army, and no one thinks of Boston harbor when they hear talk of tea parties. In a dozen years, the colonies are on the brink of rebellion. What happens to bring this country so quickly near war with England? EPISODE 2: "Blows Must Decide" 1774-1776

A total break from Great Britain remains hard for Americans to imagine, even after shots are fired at Lexington and Concord. Words push matters "Over the Edge" in 1776. Common Sense argues that it is the natural right of men to govern themselves. The Declaration of Independence declares this same idea a "self-evident" truth. For Americans, there is no looking back. There will be war with England. EPISODE 3: "The Times That Try Men's Souls" 1776-1777

Days after the Declaration of Independence is signed, a British force arrives in New York harbor. Washington and his troops are driven to New Jersey. With only a few days of enlistment left for many of his volunteers, a desperate Washington leads his army quietly across the Delaware River on the day after Christmas, 1776, to mount a surprise attack on a sleeping garrison in Trenton. EPISODE 4: "Oh Fatal Ambition" 1777-1778

The "united" states remain in dire need of funds and military support. Congress dispatches Benjamin Franklin to France in hopes of creating an alliance which will provide both. Meanwhile, a British army marches down the Hudson River trying to cut off New England from the other colonies. The British are crushed by Americans at Saratoga. The French enter the conflict on the American side. EPISODE 5: "The World Turned Upside Down" 1778-1783

The British hope to exploit the issue of slavery and to enlist the support of loyalists in the south. They fail. After a series of brutal engagements, the British army heads for Virginia, only to be trapped by the miraculous convergence of Washington's army and the French fleet at Yorktown. The end of the war is at hand. EPISODE 6: "Are We to Be a Nation? 1783-1788

Peace comes to the United States, but governing the world's newest republic is no simple task. Congress is ineffectual and individual states act like sovereign nations. By the time the Constitutional Convention convenes in 1787, many wonder if the country can survive. The long ratification process helps define what sort of nation the United States is to be a process that continues to this day.

Vechte-Cortelyou House [Old Stone House] At 09:00, Washington arrived from Manhattan.[67] Washington realized that he had been wrong about a feint on Long Island and he ordered more troops to Brooklyn from Manhattan.[67] Washingtons location on the battlefield is not known, because accounts differ, but most likely he was at Brooklyn Heights, where he could view the battle.[68] On the American right, to the west, Stirling still held the line against Grant.[68] Stirling held on for four hours, still unaware of the British flanking maneuver, and some of his own troops thought they were winning the day because the British had been unable to take their position. However, by 11:00, Grant, reinforced by 2,000 marines, hit Stirlings center and Stirling was attacked on his left by the Hessians.[65][68] Stirling pulled back but British troops were, at this point, coming at him in his rear south down the Gowanus Road. The only escape route left was across a Brouwers millpond on the Gowanus Creek which was 80 yards wide, on the other side of Brooklyn Heights.[69] Maryland 400 Stirling ordered all of his troops, except a contingent of Maryland troops under the command of Gist, to cross the creek. This group of Maryland troops became known to history as the Maryland 400, although they numbered about 260270 men. Stirling and Gist led the troops in a rear-guard action against the overwhelming numbers of British troops which surpassed 2,000 supported by two cannons.[69] Stirling and Gist led the Marylanders in two attacks against the British who were in fixed positions in and in front of the Vechte-Cortelyou House (known today as the Old Stone House). After the last assault, the remaining troops retreated across the Gowanus Creek. Some of the men who tried to cross the marsh were bogged down in the mud and under musket fire and others who could not swim were captured. Stirling was surrounded and, unwilling to surrender, broke through the British lines to von Heisters Hessians and surrendered to them. Two hundred fifty six Maryland troops were killed in the assaults in front of the Old Stone House, and fewer than a dozen made it back to the American lines.[70] Washington, watching from a redoubt on nearby Cobble Hill (intersection of todays Court Street and Atlantic Avenue), reportedly said, Good God, what brave fellows I must this day lose.[69][note 1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Island#Vechte-Cortelyou_House

Great Posts! Thank you Proud to have served as the Command Sergeant Major for the legacy unit of the Maryland 400 (175th Infantry, 6th oldest regiment in the US Army).

My Cousin Arron Mershon died in this battle protecting us from the invaders. He was one of the lucky ones that his body was removed and taken home for burial. He got a gravestone. Most of the dead did not. The British burred the dead in a mass grave that was not marked. It was 15 years before Americans got back in the area and the mass grave was not found.

Yes, it’s a real shame that some of these brave souls lie buried beneath areas of Brooklyn without even a marker.

As First Sergeant:

“Company B, then a part of the 1st Battalion, 115th Infantry, was mobilized as a separate company attached to the 48th Infantry Brigade from the Georgia Army National Guard, and deployed to Iraq in 2004. They served for one year, conducting full spectrum operations against enemy forces in the vicinity of Taji, Iraq, then transitioned to supporting combat logistics patrols between Baghdad and the Jordanian border. They returned in May 2006 and were reassigned to the 1st Battalion, 175th Infantry and alerted for their next deployment less than one year later.” As Operations Sergeant:

“In March 2007, the entire battalion was alerted for its deployment to Iraq. On 22 May 2007, the battalion was federalized and on 25 May, it reported to Fort Dix, New Jersey for post-mobilization training in preparation for security forces operations in Northern Iraq. The first elements from the battalion arrived at Camp Buehring, Kuwait, in early August 2007 and deployed into Iraq after a week of acclimatization and training. The remainder of the battalion arrived in theater by 21 August and all had been flown to their bases by 1 September. 1-175 Infantry was assigned to the 3rd Sustainment Brigade, of the 3rd Infantry Division. The battalion was deployed to the former Iraqi air base west of Qayyarah, Iraq, known as Q-West. Company C was detached and deployed to Forward Operating Base Marez and the Logistics Support Area Diamondback located in Mosul, Iraq. There, Company C was attached to the 87th Combat Service and Support Battalion, where they conducted base defense operations and convoy logistics patrols to and from the border crossing at Habur Gate, Turkey. Companies B and D were attached to the 17th Combat Service and Support Battalion to conduct convoy logistics patrols throughout Ninewah Provence also known as Multi-National Division  North (MND-N). The battalion headquarters retained command and control of HHC and Company A, with additional command and control of a contract security force made up of local Iraqis and Ugandans. They conducted aggressive base defense operations on and in the vicinity of the Q-West base complex. The battalion also supported combat, logistics and counter improvised explosive device (IED) operations conducted with both US and Iraqi Army forces throughout MND-N. The battalion suffered only 8 wounded while serving 250 days of continuous operations. Collectively, the battalion conducted 310 convoy logistics patrols, 81 route clearance operations and 280 reaction force operations. The battalion redeployed to Fort Dix in mid-April 2008” As Command Sergeant Major:

“In January 2010, 1-175 Infantry again was notified that it would be mobilized and deployed, this time as the U.S. infantry battalion assigned to the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) Mission #55 in the Sinai Peninsula, enforcing the Camp David Accords and the Treaty of Peace between Egypt and Israel. It was mobilized on 21 March 2011, and moved to Camp Atterbury, Indiana for a brief period of pre-mobilization training. The battalion deployed to the Sinai on 27 April 2011. 1-175 Infantry was the first U.S. force to perform this mission after the overthrow of the Mubarak regime during the Arab Spring revolution in Egypt. The battalion faced security challenges in and around their area of operations, including increased weapons trafficking, terrorist attacks, and conflicts with Bedouin tribes.[5] The battalion returned to Camp Atterbury on 9 March 2012.” In March 2007, the entire battalion was alerted for its deployment to Iraq. On 22 May 2007, the battalion was federalized and on 25 May, it reported to Fort Dix, New Jersey for post-mobilization training in preparation for security forces operations in Northern Iraq.
