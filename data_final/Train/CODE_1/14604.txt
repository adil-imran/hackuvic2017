GAZA CITY // Israel bombed Hamas sites in the Gaza Strip early on Saturday, causing damage but no casualties.

The strikes were launched just hours after rockets from the territory hit southern Israel late on Friday, causing no casualties or damage.

According to Palestinian security sources, the raids targeted four empty facilities ranging from Beit Hanoun in the north of Gaza to Rafah in the south.

The Israeli army said its “aircraft targeted two Hamas military training facilities and two military sites in the Gaza Strip”.

Since the end of Israel’s war on Gaza in the summer of 2014, nearly 30 projectiles fired from the Hamas-ruled enclave have hit Israel.

Sunni militants claiming links to ISIL have said they were behind rocket fire from Gaza in recent months, but Israel holds Hamas responsible for all such incidents.

Also on Friday, two Palestinians were wounded by Israeli gunfire after they crossed the border fence in northern Gaza.
