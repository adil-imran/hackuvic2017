ISIS commits massacre in village in Deir Ezzor, claiming the lives of nearly 300 civilians

(SANA) ~ Daesh (the so called ISIS, ISIL) mercenary-terrorists committed a massacre in al-Bghailiye village (in Deir Ezzor’s western countryside), claiming the lives of around 300 civilians, most of them women, children, and elderly people, local sources said to SANA reporters.

The Syrian government condemned the heinous crime, with Prime Minister Wael al-Halaqi saying that the legal and moral responsibility for this barbaric and cowardly massacre committed by ISIS hordes lies on the shoulders of all the states that support terrorism and that fund and armor Takfiri organizations which harbor hatred for all humanity.

The Premier said that terrorist organizations are committing massacres to make up for the recurring losses and defeats they suffer at the hands of the Syrian Arab Army, and that these terror organizations know that their days in Syria are numbered.

He said that such massacres will not dissuade Syrians from pursuing reconciliations and working to liberate the entirety of Syrian territories, offering condolences to the families of the victims.
