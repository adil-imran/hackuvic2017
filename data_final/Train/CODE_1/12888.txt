Iranian Intelligence Minister Meets Iraqi President

TEHRAN (FNA)- Iranian Intelligence Minister Seyed Mahmoud Alavi held a meeting with Iraqi President Foad Ma'soum in Baghdad on Sunday.

According to the Iraqi presidential office, Alavi and Ma'soum discussed the latest developments in the region as well as security and military cooperation between Tehran and Baghdad in the war on the ISIL terrorists.

During the meeting, Ma'soum appreciated Iran's assistance to Iraq in campaign against terrorism, and underlined the necessity for cooperation among the regional states, specially Tehran and Baghdad.

In relevant remarks earlier this month, UN Special Envoy for Iraq Yan Kubish appreciated Iran's supports for the Iraqi nation and government in the ongoing war with the Takfiri terrorists.

"We appreciate Iran's support for the Iraqi people in their fight against the ISIL," Kubish said in a meeting with Chairman of the Expediency Council (EC) Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in Tehran.

The UN envoy expressed regret over spread of human catastrophe in Iraq because of terrorist activities and financial crises which have been caused by a sharp decline in oil revenues.

Kubish, meantime, reiterated the need for protecting Iraq's sovereignty and national unity.

He urged the international community to help the Iraqi people to fight the ISIL as enemy of mankind.
