QUETTA - The Balochistan government has decided to set up a special force for deployment at university campuses in the province in the aftermath of last weekâ€™s terror attack on the Bacha Khan University in Charsadda.Some 60 personnel would be deployed at each university, said Blaochistan Home Secretary Akbar Hussain Durrani in a media interview. The well-equipped new force would be answerable to vice chancellors, but administratively it would be handled by police, he added.It may be mentioned that 21 people lost their lives when gunmen attacked students and faculty at the Bacha Khan University last week. This was the second major attack on an educational institution after massacre of 144 persons at Army Public School in Peshawar in Dec 2014.Security in and around all university campuses in Balochistan had already been tightened. Similarly, security at universities and colleges all across the country has been beefed up.The Punjab government also issued orders for foolproof security arrangements in public, private, missionary, armed forces, multinational schools, colleges and universities.
