A wheelchair-bound woman was gang-raped by up to six migrants at a Swedish asylum centre after asking if she could use their toilet, it has been reported.

The woman, in her 30s, was sharing a taxi home with a man after going in the medieval town of Visby on Sweden's Gotland island when she asked to stop off.

Her fellow passenger invited her inside before she was brutally set upon in the toilet, her lawyer said.

Maybe these six guys will have to seek asylum in the Ecuadorean Embassy? No, I expect not. Slap on the wrist, at best. Who knows, they may be contenders for the George Soros Medal of Freedom.

Wheelchair-bound woman is gang-raped by six migrants at Swedish asylum centre I guess it's not politically correct to point out that citizens aren't allowed to have firearms over there, or that there is a 99.999% chance that these "migrants" were muzzie bastards. Coming soon to the USA when Hillary get's her OPEN BORDERS wish.

Hitlary doesn’t see anything wrong with it, he’ll she’s wondering right now if her husband was one of the rapists and how is this going to hurt her in the polls

If she was dressed head to toe in a burqa, this would have never happened. So really, the female is to blame here. /Islamic mindset

Obviously this is just an “isolated” unfortunate incident. Let’s open up our borders anyway.

From the article: “The assault sparked anger in the town and extra police were called to the island when an angry mob attacked the asylum centre with rocks.” “The head of Gotland police Torbjörn Nilsson said: ‘[Blah blah blah] there are few crimes compared to the rest of the country. But the way people have now acted is unprecedented.’” Nice to know the police are only concerned that the citizens are standing up for themselves, and that Moslems gang-raping women is really no big deal.

Just Muzzies doing the rapes Swedes won’t do.

Small price to pay for having a million or so Muslims come and enrich your country.

Can’t rehabilitate them, this kind of savagery is a disease on the civil society. They should be put down like rabid dogs.



To: C19fan

Must have been a group think psychotic break from islum. The woman was obviously not properly covered so her fault. That hurt to write but I have a feeling this would be the defense in the multicultured sharia court.

Earlier today: "The report compiled by Save the Children suggested Sweden was the best place for young females to live. Niger finished at the bottom. The U.S. was rated 32nd on the 144-country list." Link. Another day, another insult to my intelligence.

“Cant rehabilitate them, this kind of savagery is a disease on the civil society. They should be put down like rabid dogs.”

Heck, they won’t even allow feral dogs to be put down. Hundreds run loose in south Dallas and the city does nothing. A local black woman was attacked and killed by a pack of dogs in broad daylight.

One would think they would declare open season on feral dogs.

They’d be wiped out in a week.

Same solution for muzzies run amuck would also work.

I visited this town with my family last August. Wonderful little extremely well preserved medieval walled city. The island is isolated, rural, with lots of neolithic sites and medieval churches, probably 30 years culturally behind the rest of Sweden. Why they let a single one of the “migrants” on it is beyond me.

Heard about that on local news... To me the logical next step is to get a group of Men together to go take care of business. If I recall correctly, that lady was afraid to step outside her door to see a Dr.

These are not humans, but insects or rodents.

*********** ` ` What?? ` ` ` WHAT??? ` ` Probably got interrupted by a "call to prayer".



To: montag813

An insult to insects and rodents, whose behavior is never this malignant. No, they are morally derpraved human beings. When humans fall morally, they do not fall to the bestial. They fall to the demonic.

What kind of woman is stupid enough to share a taxi with oe of these vermin, and THEN ask if they can come inside and use rheir bathroom? I feel bad for her but a little less so because this is just a few levels down from walking past carrying a sign saying “please rape me”
