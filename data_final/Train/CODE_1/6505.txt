There is now an “extremely high” likelihood that the death cult will try to destabilise the final months of the campaign by carrying out gun attacks and exploding bombs in US cities.

The shock warning comes from one the world’s leading authorities on ISIS and comes amid fears the group has acquired highly dangerous radioactive material which could be used to make a dirty bomb.

Dr Theodore Karasik, a Gulf-based analyst of regional geo-political affairs said: “There is an extremely high likelihood that ISIS followers will throw off the election in the United States by using Paris-style violence in American cities.”

And he even predicted that such attacks could hand a shock victory to Donald Trump by boosting his anti-immigration, anti-Muslim stance.

Islamic State has carried out more than 70 terrorist attacks in 20 countries outside Iraq and Syria since it declared its caliphate in 2014.

Analytsts expect this number to surge in 2016 as it seeks to expand it’s impact on the western world.

And according to Dr Karasik, ISIS could directly benefit from a Donald Trump victory because his policy towards Iran would seriously destabilise the Middle East.
