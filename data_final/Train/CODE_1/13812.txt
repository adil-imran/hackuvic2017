PanARMENIAN.Net - Bars Media film studio unveiled a short documentary, where Armenian soldier Narek Malkhasyan and other servicemen from the southeastern section of the contact line tell the story of how they identified the Azerbaijani helicopter and destroyed it.

When the helicopter attacked the Armenian position on April 5, Malkhasyan was in the blindage. On hearing the military alarm sound, the soldier ran out and saw the aircraft preparing to storm the blindage and destroy the whole crew. At that moment, Malkhasyan, an artilleryman himself, downed the helicopter with a mortar shot.
