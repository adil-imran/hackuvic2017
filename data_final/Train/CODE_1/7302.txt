Ministry Calls on Ambassadors to Focus on Duties

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta-The Foreign Affairs Ministry responded to Indonesian Ambassador to Japan Yusron Ihza Mahendra’s racist tweet directed to Jakarta Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama by calling on all ambassadors to focus on serving their duties.

“The Foreign Affairs Ministry calls on heads of representatives, including ambassadors, consul generals, and others, to focus on the tasks given by the government,” Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir said in Jakarta on Thursday, March 31, 2016.

Earlier on Monday, March 28, 2016, Yusron tweeted via his Twitter account @YusronIhza_Mhd, “If [Ahok] loves descent and poor Chinese [descendants] who can afford to get out of the country whenever an ethnic riot breaks out, Ahok must not be arrogant when serving his duty [as a governor]. He must think about poor, descent, and innocent Chinese [descendants] who may become victims [of riots].’Ahok said that he was frustrated with the tweet made by the younger brother of Crescent and Star Party (PBB) politician Yusril Ihza Mahendra. Currently, Yusril and Ahok are preparing to fight for the governor seat in next year’s election.

“The more candidates in election, the more people of Jakarta will be benefited. As long as their programs are clear. Someone just tweeted in a threatening manner that poor Chinese descendants could be massacred because of me,” Ahok said in Jakarta on Wednesday, March 30, 2016.

Ahok later called on Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi to evaluate Yusron.

“That was disrespectful and racist. Minister Retno should not employ a person who wanted to change the first pillar of Pancasila,” Ahok added.

In response to a question related to Foreign Affairs Ministry’s stance towards Yusron’s tweet, Arrmanatha repeated his statement saying that representatives should be focused on their duties and responsibilities.
