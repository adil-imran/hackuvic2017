PIKE COUNTY, Ohio - The relationships between the family members killed in execution-style shootings in Ohio on Friday have been released by the attorney general’s office.

Dana Rhoden, 37, and her ex-husband Christopher Rhoden Sr., 40, were among the deceased.

Three children that the former couple had together also were among those killed:

Hanna Rhoden, 19

Christopher Rhoden Jr., 16

Clarence “Frankie” Rhoden, 20

A brother of Christopher Rhoden Sr., Kenneth Roden, 44, was killed. Their cousin, Gary Rhoden, 38, was also shot to death.

Clarence “Frankie” Rhoden’s partner, Hannah Gilley, 20, also was killed in the shootings.

Children surviving the shootings were the following:

Hanna Rhoden's 4-day-old daughter

Clarence "Frankie" Rhoden’s 3-year-old son

Clarence "Frankie" Rhoden and Hannah Gilley's 6-month old son.

Authorities have not said what may have motivated the shootings, which happened at four different locations in Pike County, about 100 miles east of Cincinnati. No suspects have been identified.

Investigators found marijuana grow operations at three of the four crime scenes, although it was not immediately clear whether the killings were drug-related. Pike County Sheriff Charles Reader has warned other Rhoden family members to be vigilant in case of further attacks.
