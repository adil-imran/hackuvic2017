The Big Conversation

The Tribune over the weekend took a look in a couple of must read pieces at legislating and its consequences when it comes to the hot button social issues of abortion and vaccines.

— The Tribune’s Alexa Ura had the tragic story of an Austin couple where a series of events ended with the mother giving birth to a stillborn baby boy.

Attempts to help the couple earlier ran up against the 2013 law passed by state lawmakers that banned abortions on or after 20 weeks of gestation.

Ura wrote, “The tragic ordeal appears to be one of the side effects of House Bill 2, and several doctors say such consequences are not limited to the Mahaffey’s case. The 2013 restrictions — and the larger, intense political climate in Texas surrounding abortion — are overwhelming the physician-patient relationship and holding some doctors back from acting on medical judgment that balances professional protocols and compassionate care, they say.

— The Tribune’s Morgan Smith took a look at efforts by parents to organize against proposed legislation from last year that would have made it more difficult for parents to get non-medical exemptions from school immunization requirements for their children.

Dallas state Rep. Jason Villalba filed the bill and told the Tribune that he was surprised to find he had touched such a sensitive topic.

“The animus that was leveled against me for that was very surprising to me,” said Villalba, who drew opposition from the group but still won his primary race. “These people, they literally said it to my face — they hate me. That was troubling. Because I get it, they care about their children — but I care about my children too, and the children of the community.”
