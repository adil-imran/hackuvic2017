Lil Wayne is so desperate to sell off his Miami Beach home that he has slashed the price by $6million over the course of 2016, and now has the house listed for $12million.

The rapper purchased the 15,101-square-foot home, which has nine bedrooms and nine bathrooms, for the same price in 2006.

Over the last ten years, the home has been the scene of at least two swatting incidents -where SWAT teams are deployed to an unsuspecting victim's home under false pretenses - including last month when police received a call claiming a man had been shot and was bleeding at the rappers home.

Earlier this week Wayne announced that he would not work again until Cash Money Records pays him the millions he claims the company owes him.

'I have a family. I have kids. I have a mother. We have bills. This is just business,' he said, adding that he will never work with Birdman again.

Last week he hinted on social media that he was done with the music business.

Lil Wayne suffered two seizures while on a flight from Wisconsin to California in the spring, causing the pilot of his private jet to make two emergency landings in Omaha, Nebraska.

The New Orleans native - best known for his hits Mirror and How To Love n - had 'blacked outâ€™.
