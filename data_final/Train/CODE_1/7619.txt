The mass in Notre Dame will be in tribute of Father Jacques Hamel killed by two jihadists, who stormed his church during Mass on July 26 and slit his throat in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray.

SAINT-ETIENNE-DU-ROUVRAY, France - Two months after its priest was murdered by teenage jihadists, parishioners of a Catholic church in northern France will gather on Sunday for a solemn re-opening ceremony to seek solace and solidarity.

The Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray church, a focal point of a small town of some 27,000 near the city of Rouen, will hold a special penitential mass to mark the occasion and pay tribute to Father Jacques Hamel.

The 85-year-old priest had his throat slit at the foot of the altar on July 26 in an attack claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group.

"He was a good priest. I always went to see him and he never refused to be of service," said 81-year-old Mafalda Pace, who lives just next door to the 16th-century church.

Pace said Saturday she would be among those following the penitential rite of cleansing and subsequent mass presided over by Archbishop of Rouen Dominique Lebrun.

"The rite consists of 'cleansing' the church through the sprinkling of holy water," said the archbishop, who also celebrated an August 2 funeral mass for the slain priest at Rouen Cathedral which was attended by President Francois Hollande and Prime Minister Manuel Valls.

Priest killed in France church hostage taking 1 of of An elderly priest had his throat slit in a church in northern France on Tuesday after two men stormed the building and took hostages.

The attack in the Normandy town of Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray came as France was still coming to terms with the massacre in the French Riviera city of Nice claimed by the Islamic State group.

Two men arrived at the 17th century Eglise Saint-Etienne church during morning mass, storming the building and taking five hostages inside.

During the siege they killed a retired priest in his 80s by slitting his throat and seriously injured another captive.

The victim was father Jacques Hamel, a semi-retired assistant parish priest, according to the archbishop of nearby Rouen Dominique Lebrun.

Hamel was born in 1930 in Darnetal, a town near Saint-Etienne du Rouvray and was ordained in 1958, according to information on the diocesan website.

As the two attackers made to leave the church they were confronted by a French police unit specialising in hostage situations, the BRI, and shot dead.

Three of the hostages were freed unharmed.

The scene was then secured by officers from France's elite RAID unit who scoured the area for explosive devices. None were found.

The Islamic State group said on Tuesday that the two assailants were its "soldiers," an IS-linked news agency reported.

In a show of inter-faith solidarity, Muslims and Jews were among the mourners on that occasion.

Sunday's rite is designed to wipe away the profaning of the church at the hands of jihadists Adel Kermiche, a local man, and Abdel-Malik Petitjean, both of whom were shot dead by police following a siege.

Local clergy will join the archbishop for Sunday's services, which will follow a mid-afternoon procession to the church with members of the local Muslim community pledging to join.

"It will be a day of brotherhood ... I hope that all local people will be there, believers or not," Mohamed Karabila, representing the local mosque, told AFP.

A giant screen has been set up to allow people who cannot fit into the church to follow the service outside.

The killing of Father Hamel came less than two weeks after the Bastille Day attack that claimed 86 lives when a Tunisian extremist rammed a truck into crowds on a popular promenade in the southern city of Nice.

The priest's murder and the Nice massacre some seven months after the November Paris attacks were the latest in a series of jihadist attacks to rock France over the past year and a half.
