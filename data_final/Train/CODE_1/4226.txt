According to reports, the two came across each other at the helipad in Mardan and discussed the terrorists’ heinous attacks in Mardan and Peshawar in brief and agreed to eliminate the scourge of terrorism. They discussed the current situation after at least 14 people were killed and 35 injured when a suicide bomber attacked the district court. Sources said Gen Raheel and Imran also discussed the military operation Zarb-e-Azb.

They strongly condemned the heinous attacks and vowed to eliminate the scourge of terrorism from its roots. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Pervez Khattak was also present in the meeting that lasted a few minutes. COAS Gen Raheel Sharif appreciated the efforts of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s police for taking measures against terrorism.

According to the sources, Gen Raheel Sharif was accompanied by Corps Commander Peshawar Lt-Gen Hidayatur Rahman and other high-ups. General Raheel Sharif was in Mardan to visit the Mardan Medical Complex to inquire after the injured persons in the suicide attack.

PTI Chairman Imran Khan also visited Mardan Medical Complex after a suicide attack on the lower court’s premises and enquired after the injured persons being treated there. Khan appreciated the prompt action taken by the security forces and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police against terrorists and said if the counteraction had not been taken on time, it could have been an incident like the Quetta tragedy.

Later, while talking to media people, PTI Chairman Imran Khan said: “We are encouraging terrorism by not solving the problems of Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata).
