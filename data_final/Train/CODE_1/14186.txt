There are 11 total releases this week, fiends. Pretty much every one is a recent production, including Guillermo del Toro’s Crimson Peak, which is probably the biggest title of the bunch. I think del Toro’s ability to bring his imagination to life on the big screen is brilliant, so I will be grabbing a copy of this for my collection.

Our one classic this week is 1971’s A Lizard in a Woman’s Skin from the mind of another legend in the genre, Lucio Fulci. This is a must-have for collectors of Giallo Blu-rays.

Outside of those releases, everything else here is relatively fresh with the exception of 2000’s Nutbag, 2012’s Red Krokodil, and 2011’s Back From Hell.

I hope everyone has a happy Valentine’s Day this upcoming weekend. Just remember that if you see someone in a gas mask carrying a pick-axe, it may be best to not cross his path. Pleasant viewing.

In Freaks of Nature, we welcome you to Dillford, where three days ago, everything was peaceful and business as usual: the vampires were at the top of the social order, the zombies were at the bottom, and the humans were getting along in the middle. But this delicate balance was ripped apart when the alien apocalypse arrived in Dillford and put an end to all the harmony. Now it’s humans vs. vampires vs. zombies in all-out, blood-sucking, brain-eating, vamp-staking mortal combat – and all of them are on the run from the aliens. It is up to three teenagers – one human, one vampire, and one zombie – to team up, figure out how to get rid of the interplanetary visitors, and try to restore order to this “normal” little town.

A Lizard in a Woman’s Skin (1971)

Starring:

Stanley Baker, Florinda Bolkan, Jean Sorel, Anita Strindberg

Synopsis:

Carol Hammond, the frustrated wife of a successful London lawyer, is having bizarre, erotic dreams about her uninhibited neighbor, Julia Durer, who presides over noisy, sex and drug filled parties in the house next door. One night, Carol’s dreams culminate in violent death and she wakes to find her nightmares have become reality – Julia has been murdered and Carol is the main suspect. This frightening discovery is just the beginning of a labyrinthine psycho sexual shocker which takes the viewer on a wild ride through a series of frequently breathtaking set pieces that set new standards for the Italian thriller.

This first US Blu-ray release of the film, taken from the original negative, is the longest uncut version currently available and it comes with a host of exclusive extras. Directed by controversial film maker Lucio Fulci (The New York Ripper, House by the Cemetery, Zombie), Lizard in a Woman’s Skin is considered by many critics to be his finest achievement.

Nutbag (2000)

Starring:

Mack Hail, Renee Baio, Alan Margolies

Synopsis:

Nutbag is the terrifying, true-life story of a man who murders without provocation. A lonely depraved killer stalks beautiful women in Las Vegas, where he kills at random. There seems to be no end to his madness. Nutbag welcomes viewers to enter the mind of a psychopath, feel his pain, and follow him in his daily life, watching as the blood flows. Massacre Video presents Nutbag, the first feature-length film from genre master Nick Palumbo, the director of the controversial 35mm epic Murder-Set-Pieces. Boasting an all-new transfer created from the original Nutbag master, this release is essential viewing for fans of confrontational cinema.

Red Krokodil (2012)

Starring:

Brock Madson, Valerio Cassa, Simone Destrero, Viktor Karam

Synopsis:

Red Krokodil tells the story of a man meant to represent all men. It is the story of a man addicted to Krokodil , that suddenly finds himself alone in a post-nuclear city similar to Chernobyl. His physical decay, caused by the massive intake of drugs, is mirrored in his inner world, as reality mixes with hallucinations. The result is a film that uses the Krokodil as a metaphor of destruction.

This movie deals with many themes, from the environment to the use of drugs, but the story is just an excuse that director Domiziano Cristopharo uses to focus on a psychological condition that brings a total detachment from oneself and from the surrounding world. A dark trip that shows no way out.

Purchase:
