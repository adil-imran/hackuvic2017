A wakeup call

I pray for everyone to be safe – that is the most important thing (‘Huge fire breaks out at Ajman residential building’, Gulf News, March 30)! That been said, I think the management of all towers should take the safety of all tenants more seriously! The tower I live in has an average of three false fire alarms per week. How do they expect people to know the difference when a real fire occurs? This is a wakeup call! Readers need to report any mismanagement, especially when your live are on the line. Bless us all.

Obstacles in emergency stairs

Police and Civil Defence should check the security of these buildings regularly. It’s amazing how you can walk from the 21 floor to the ground floor and you can see a lot of trash, furniture and stuff in the emergency stairs. I hope that no one gets hurt because of these obstacles.

Replace extinguishers

Can you imagine all the fire extinguishers that are at least one to three years expired? When we complained about this, they only replaced the one in our home, but they refused to replace the building’s extinguishers.

False fire alarms

I was living in Tower 4 in May 2014 and in the beginning there was a fire alarm going off all the time – almost every day. But then last July 2015, there was a real fire and the bad thing is that no one took it seriously as we thought it was just another false fire alarm. It happened again in November so I decided to move out.

And yes, Mr Paulo Santos, that’s true about there being no discipline with a lot of trash, they damaged the mirror in the elevator and cigarettes thrown around. Anyway, I hope everyone is safe.

Clutter everywhere

Mr Miles A., that happens a lot. The fire alarm rings, someone turns it off. The problem is that tenants are undisciplined and they leave their clutter everywhere. But still though the material outside the building is often really inflammable. That’s why the fire spreads so quickly!

What a scene!

We were attending a wedding in the next building. It was a horror to see the ashes of the building flying in the air. People were running out of their homes. Please pray for them.

Old wiring

I think a reason for fires some building fires in the UAE is the old wires being used. They should replace the wiring in all the buildings. There will be more fires in the summer because the old wires are worn now.

New building codes

Actually, you’ll see fires in others cities as well due to old wiring. Also, they just don’t use this kind of cladding anymore, so fires don’t spread like they do. I’m sure there are not anymore fires where fire retardant cladding is used. It just gets worse because the fire spreads.

Making the impossible possible with hard work

It is very interesting to read about Dubai horseracing by sharing past experiences of the hardships of desert life (‘Horse Racing has come home to Dubai: Mohammad Bin Rashid’, Gulf News, March 26). His Highness Shaikh Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of UAE and Ruler of Dubai, has made the impossible possible through hard work and strong willpower to succeed. I respect him for this. It is true that Arabs are closely associated with horses and camels and history has proved it.

End the persecution of Rohingya

With regards to the editorial in The Views section, it is appreciated to know that Aung San Suu Kyi’s new government will employ an ethnic minister to look into the affairs of the ethnic minorities (‘My-anmar government should re-engage with minorities’, Gulf News, March 25). They must essentially deal with the case of the endless persecution of the Rohingya who have continuously been the object of deleterious ethnic cleansing in Myanmar. But, the question remains on how efficiently she will be able to solve these abominable issues with the minorities amidst partnership with the military, who have been employing armed insurrection over the minorities for many years.

Beastly carnage

The carnage which took place in Brussels, Belgium recently should be condemned by the world community and by the UN (‘Bombers prepared ‘satanic cocktail’, Gulf News, March 27). It was a slap in the face of humanity by a set of blood thirsty terrorists who want to annihilate humanity from the face of the Earth. Nations should join together and condemn the atrocity committed by these terrorists.

From Mr Thomas Matthew

Unite against evil

Human life is precious. Therefore, please do not allow these silly terrorists to go on killing innocent people in these horrible sprees. The world has to unite to drive out such evil. Religion has nothing to do with it.

It will be a hit

A lot of people like the iPhone 5S design more than the iPhone 6 or 6S design (‘Will Apple’s new iPhone be a huge hit in UAE?’, Gulf News, March 25). With improved specs and the price being “considerably” lower, I think it will be a hit in the UAE.

From Mr Tanuj Malhotra

Facebook comment

People want the latest

No way, Mr Tanuj Malhotra. It does look like a 5S and that’s why it won’t do well. People want the latest model here, not oan utdated model. iPhones don’t hang around as the iOS software is extremely light. It makes sense to buy a 6 or a 6S.

From Mr Nasser Rawuther

Facebook comment

Cheaper, faster, smaller

For sure it’s going to be a hit in the market. It looks like the 5S, but it is smaller with a four-inch screen. The specification is almost exactly like the iPhone 6 and 6S and the price will be around 1,600, which is cheaper, faster and smaller. It will be a hit for sure.

Economical, not cheap

When Gulf News writes about a “cheap” version of Apple, I feel that you insult people who cannot afford to spend lavishly or people who don’t want to waste money on expensive phones and prefer to buy economical phones.

Respect all our elders

I was raised knowing that we must respect our elders (‘Pope washes — then kisses — the feet of Muslim, Hindu, Catholic refugees’, Gulf News, March 26). Even though we are all human beings, we must not let the Pope sit at our feet, washing and kissing them. The gesture is lovely, but we should insist that this is not necessary.

From Mr Iftikhar Ahmad

Facebook comment

Inclusivity is vital

Religion has been able to divide the world along such lines that it becomes almost impossible to reach a compromise. Humans must be aware that making the world a better place to live is our collective responsibility and as such, we should shun any belief that will jeopardise our collective existence. Religions teach us to be inclusive.

From Mr Daniel Collins

Why the gesture?

The Pope is a respected religious figure in the world of Christianity. Why is he washing and kissing the feet of people? He is very old. Shouldn’t those people who are being visited by the Pope be the ones who kiss his hands and feet? He is a clean and purified person.

From Ms Soraya Salido

Facebook comment

Symbolic gesture

But, Mr Iftikhar Ahmad, in the Last Supper, the Prophet Jesus [PBUH] washed the feet of his disciples to teach humility. The pope traditionally washes the feet of 12 representatives. Basically, it symbolises humility and service.

Proper response to caste

The reader comment on a caste-instigated, but gory murder of a Dalit boy in India makes light of the incident. It is not as simple as he makes out that a father got angry when his daughter fell in love with the boy and killed him (‘Letter to the editor: Condemnable action’, Gulf News, March 25).

Mr K. Ragavan makes a factual error when he suggests the federal government strategy is the right reply to such incidents. The bane of four-tier Indian caste system is inhuman and cruel and it is supported and patronised by the right wing dispensation – that includes the current federal government.

The Right-wing considers the caste system the cardinal bedrock of Hindu theology. Recently, when Dalits were killed in Haryana by upper caste people, a federal minister and top Bharatiya Janata Party leader used the analogy of a dog. A Dalit student, Rohit Vemula, doing research in a Hyderabad University had been forced into suicide after persecutions and withdrawing of his fellowships and scholarships by the university officials at the behest of Federal Human Resources Ministry and the student wing of the BJP. The incident triggered a nation-wide fury and everyone is still fuming.
