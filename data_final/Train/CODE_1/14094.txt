From Femi Oyelola, Kaduna

Members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, IMN Wednesday embarked on a peaceful demonstration in Kaduna metropolis demanding unconditional release of their national leader Sheik Ibrahim El-Zakzaky who has been detained for the past 50 days by security agents.

The protesters who are mostly students came under auspices of Academic Forum of the Movement said it is pathetic that contrary to Nigerian constitution that said nobody can be detained more than 24hours without being charged to the court, sheik El-Zakzaky has been in custody for 50 days which is a violation of his constitutional right.

The leader of the protest, Mikaeel Yusuf said following the military assault on the resident of sheik El-Zakzaky and two of their centers 730 of their members have been missing while 220 are in Kaduna prison among them women and students.

“We must accept the fact that students lay the foundation stone of the future of all societies because the youthful stage of a student is a prominent stage compare to all stages of life. It is a stage where students learn life issues and how to tackle challenges ahead and how to build a beautiful life. This is a stage where the growth and development of every Nation is determined.

“It is now six weeks on, since when the Nigerian Army launched a coordinated crackdown massacre on members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria under the guardianship of his eminence Allamah Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky (H). Tens of students were brutally killed by the Nigerian Army and hundreds more are still under illegal detentions.

“This is a display of inhumane and gross violation of fundamental human rights against fellow Nigerian Citizens.,” Shiite said.
