Ankara, SANA – Hundreds of Turks took part in demonstrations organized in Beyoglu and Gazi neighborhoods in Istanbul in condemnation of al-Zara massacre perpetrated by Erdogan-backed terrorists.

Terrorist groups of al-Rahman Legion, ahl Al-Sunna Battalions and Ajnad Homs along with Jabhat al-Nusra and Ahrar al-Sham, backed by the Turkish and Saudi regimes, perpetrated a heinous massacre against civilians of al-Zara village in the countryside of Hama last Thursday where they killed children, women and elderly in a brutal manner and abducted a number of others.

Representatives of civil societies, unions, organizations and associations issued a statement following their participation in the demonstration in Istanbul expressing solidarity with the Syrian people and holding the Turkish regime under Recep Tayyip Erdogan responsible for the crimes perpetrated by terrorist organizations in Syria.

They pointed out in their statement to the continuation of Turkish regime’s support to all terrorist organizations including ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra, re-affirming that the Turkish regime and Gulf States’ support to the terrorists aims at igniting sedition and dragging the people of the region into bloody conflicts in service of Israel’s interest.
