Nasrallah: Israel No. 1 Threat to Region

TEHRAN (FNA)- Secretary-General of the Lebanese resistance group, Hezbollah, Seyed Hassan Nasrallah underlined that Israel is still the main danger threatening the region and the Muslim world.

"Certain people feel that Israel is merely a threat to the Palestinians and poses no danger to other governments and nations," Nasrallah was quoted as saying in a message read by Sheikh Ali Daghmoush, a senior Hezbollah member, to an international conference in Tehran dubbed as 'United with al-Aqsa' on Sunday.

Although Israel is not as strong as the past thanks to the resistance movements' sacrifices and victories, he said, the Quds occupying regime still enjoys power in that region and threatens the regional nations.

"All of us should strive to say to the nations that Israel, its goals and threats are still a danger," Nasrallah said.

His remarks came after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani blasted Israel as the main source of violence and extremism, stressing the necessity for fighting criminal acts in any parts of the world.

"We should always remember the danger of the Zionist regime as the main source of violence and extremism and accept that continued massacre of innocent Palestinian people, mostly women and children, in the occupied territories, inhumane acts and Gaza siege all show the violent nature of a regime which is unfortunately continuing its savage acts under the ignorance shown by the world community, specially the western powers," Rouhani said, addressing the 13th Summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) which was held in the Turkish city of Istanbul in April.

He said that Islam has taught Muslims that there is no difference between the crimes committed in Palestine, Lahore, Beirut, Damascus and Istanbul and the crimes committed in New York, Paris and Brussels, and stressed the need for finding the root causes of the crime and confronting it with firm determination.
