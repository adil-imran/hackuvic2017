According to Dawood al-Jahalin, a spokesperson for the Abu Nuwar Bedouin community,on Wednesday morning andafterward, Palestinian Ma'an news agency reported.He added thatbefore the demolition process. "I showed them, but the officer in charge refused to see it and instead told me he had a demolition order from the Civil Administration," Jahalin said, adding that the families will rebuild their dwellings.Israeli authorities have been carrying out forced evacuations against Bedouins since 1949. The demolition of Bedouin homes is part of the regime's massive land-grab policy, which will forcefully displace thousands of people.Tel Aviv has so far refused to recognize the rights of Palestinian Bedouins and denies them access to basic services. Human rights groups say the measure will lead to the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians living there.
