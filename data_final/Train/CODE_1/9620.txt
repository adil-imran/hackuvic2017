A ‘second-in-charge’ of NDFB (Songbijit), who was wanted by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for his involvement in the December 2014 massacre of Adivasi people — was on Monday shot dead by security forces in Assam’s Chirang district, officials said.

The operation that began late Sunday night was carried out by a joint team of police and 7 Sikh LI (Light Infantry) in Ranipur area under Runikhata police station. At about 3 am on Monday the personnel came across the NDFB(S) militant Uday Narzary alias Khilikhang, the second-in-charge of Serfanguri zone, who was sheltered in the jungle patch adjoining Ranipur village and he died of bullet injuries. One AK-56 rifle along with 9 rounds of ammunition were recovered from his possession.

A defence official said in Kolkata, the terrorist had entered into the laid ambush site and on being challenged he fired on the security personnel with an automatic weapon. In the retaliatory fire the terrorist was injured and immediately evacuated to the district hospital where he was declared dead, the official said.
