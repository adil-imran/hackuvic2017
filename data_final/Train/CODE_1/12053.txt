Jeremy Corbyn has come under renewed pressure as new details emerged about Labour’s failure to tackle anti-Semitism in its ranks.

A dossier compiled by The Telegraph includes a series of disturbing examples of anti-Semitic attitudes among party activists and leading members.

It follows the suspension from the party last week of Ken Livingstone, the former Mayor of London, and of Naz Shah, Labour MP for Bradford West, for making anti-Semitic comments.

Labour has announced an independent inquiry into anti-Semitism and other forms of racism within the party.

But Mr Livingstone, who was suspended after saying that Hitler supported Zionism “before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews”, on Saturday refused to withdraw his statements and claimed the Israeli Prime Minister agreed with him.

Our dossier reveals that:

A London Labour council leader shared a Facebook post comparing the “terrorist state of Israel” to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil). He apologised and deleted it on Saturday;

Mr Corbyn questioned why an anti-Semitic mural in east London should be taken down;

The Labour leader also attended events run by self-confessed Holocaust denier Paul Eisen long after his views had become clear, and

A Labour council candidate used the derogatory term “Zios” to refer to Jews.

Muhammed Butt, leader of Brent Council and “equalities lead” on the body representing 32 London boroughs, shared a post calling Israel a terrorist state and compared it to Isil, on April 16. It showed a Palestinian girl in a skirmish with an Israeli soldier.

The author of the post, Zain Khan, wrote: “Why doesn’t this video start an outrage within Western media? You show videos of the Isis hitting women for leaving home (which is also disgusting) but you don’t condemn the terrorist state of Israel… Israel is a terrorist state like Isis.”
