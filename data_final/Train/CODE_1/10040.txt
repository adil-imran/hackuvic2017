According to the president of Italy’s Union of Islamic Communities, Pope Francis “could” visit the Grand Mosque of Rome on January 27. So said Izzedin Elzir, who presides over the body in an interview with the Italian bishops’ television network. On January 20, a Muslim delegation met with the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church in a private audience, presenting him with a formal invitation.

"A delegation representing the community at Rome mosque will meet in the Vatican this afternoon to reaffirm and underscore the importance of the dialogue with the Catholic Church that has been taking place for decades," the imam told Catholic broadcasters. “Today it is necessary to highlight the importance of this dialogue [between Muslims and Catholics] more than ever before,” said Izzedin Elzir.

A visit by the pontiff would be his first to the Grand Mosque, which opened in Rome in 1995 and has a capacity of 12,000 worshippers. In 2015, however, Pope Francis visited the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul – which was once Christendom’s biggest church and that after being seized by the Ottoman Muslim empire in the 1400s was used as a mosque until the early years of the 20th century. Upon the rise to power by dictator Kemal Ataturk, the mosque was converted into a museum.

Pope John Paul II was the first pontiff to enter a mosque. In a 2001 speech at the Olmayyad Mosque in the center of Damascus, Syria, Pope John Paul said he was aware of centuries of conflict in the Middle East between Christians and Muslims and expressed hope that the religions would now "find new ways, at the start of the third millennium, to present their respective creeds as partners and not as adversaries." For his trouble, the pope was criticized by many Muslim authorities for seeking to introduce Christianity by stealth into the heart of the Muslim world. Damascus was once the capital of much wider Muslim rule.

Pope John Paul’s express purpose of visiting Damascus was to follow the footsteps of Saint Paul, who experienced his conversion to Christianity on his way to the ancient city. What is now a mosque was in the days of Saint Paul was a Roman temple, which then became a Christian church. Approximately 1,400 years ago, it was seized by Muslims and became a mosque.

Francis has long been known for his open-ness to non-Christians. On January 17, he visited the Great Synagogue of Rome. John Paul II was the first pope to visit a synagogue. His tenure as Archbishop of Buenos Aires in his native Argentina was marked by his friendship with a local rabbi and his close relations with the Jewish community.

The news of Francis’ proximate visit to a mosque comes with word that an ancient Christian monastery in Iraq has been erased by the Islamic State’s marauders. St. Elijah’s Monastery – the oldest in Iraq – was obliterated by the Islamic State sometime in 2014 when the nearby city of Mosul was seized by the jihadis. Satellite photos confirm the destruction. The landmark was built some 1,400 years ago. Historically, Muslim warfare includes the destruction of Christian and Jewish places of worship or their conversion to use by Muslims.

A Catholic priest from Mosul told that BBC that the Iraq’s Christian history was "being barbarically levelled." Father Paul Thabit Habib, said "We see it as an attempt to expel us from Iraq, eliminating and finishing our existence in this land." The Jewish and Christian communities of Iraq long pre-date Islam. Jews, however, were subjected to ethnic cleansing during the Second World War with the approval of Muslim religious authorities in league with Nazi Germany. In his book “The Farhud,” author Edwin Black recounts the negotiations between the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem to supply troops to Germany and conspire to eliminate Jews from the Holy Land and the wider Middle East and Europe. Muslim troops served alongside German Nazi Wehrmacht troops and even staffed a death camp in Yugoslavia.
