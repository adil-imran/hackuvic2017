The Yontocket Indian Village Memorial Cemetery is located near Smith River, California on the south side of the river along the end of Pala Road. Although unmarked, this location marks the site of the Yontocket Massacre, also known as the Burnt Ranch Massacre where approximately 500 Tolowa Indians were massacred by white settlers in 1853, part of the ongoing California genocide aimed at ridding Native Americans from the westward expansion of settlers. The settlers drove the Indians out of their homes by setting their village on fire, then shooting them & dumping the deceased bodies in nearby Yontocket Slough. Similar massacres are found along this part of the coast. Today permission is required from the Tolowa Nation to enter the cemetery.
