Joy Behar sorry for calling Bill Clinton accusers 'tramps' on 'The View'

Fox News ^ | October 11, 2016 | FoxNews.com

Posted on by kevcol

Prior to the debate, Trump highlighted three women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault or harrassment. The View host Sunny Hostin suggested that Hillary Clinton may have missed an opportunity to address the controversy during the second presidential debate.

.

Behar suggested the Democratic nominee could say: I would like to apologize to those tramps that have slept with my husband. Maybe she could have said that.



The remark didnt go unnoticed.

Yikes! Warn a body! She looks like someone, but I’m can’t think of who....a man, for sure.



To: kevcol

I want to apologize," she said with her eyes focused on the camera. "I never, ever intend to belittle sexual assault and the women who are victims of it ever... I made a joke... Im sorry.



So did Trump. So since we are OK with jokes now, I guess the issue is settled.



To: kevcol

Well that’s mighty nice of...the skank.



To: kevcol

So, are there demands for her to “step down”?



To: JudyinCanada

She looks like someone, Keith Richards?

"She looks like someone, but Im cant think of who....a man, for sure." Sort of reminds me of a 60 year old Mick Jagger ...

To: kevcol

So the women are at fault? They get propositioned or groped or raped and it’s THEIR fault??? This should be grounds for firing that overpaid witch.



To: kevcol

Whoa! She could throw a jet plane in reverse...

Following Behar’s comments, should we assume if Behar was raped by Clinton people should call her a tramp??



To: SpinnerWebb

Next question?

To: kevcol

Hypocrite! Only sorry that her remarks did not advance the liberal agenda but may in fact harmed them. She is now wondering why name calling is not working.



To: kevcol

If life were fair she would lose her job for this.

Too bad Joyless Behar’s mother didnt go to a Planned Parenthood clinic when she conceived that pile of vermin..I mean just look at her, evil to the core, no soul



To: JamesP81

Yeah but when liberals say it the press says “move on” when a Republican says it they trash them for 3 weeks

It’s OK, Joy; we know where your mind and heart are.



To: kevcol

For more than a year, we have been lectured to by these people about Trump and his alleged bigotry and hatred. Yet someone like Behar wears it like Chanel No 5, my, my.

I would like to apologize to those tramps that have slept with my husband. You see Joy, there are two sides of Bubba’s ledger. Trump brought in the non-consensual side. You’re talking about the other side - Gennifer Flowers, Monica Lewinski, Maria Furtwangler, Belinda Stronach, Naomi Robson, Markie Post, Patricia Duff, Elizabeth Ward, and Sally Perdueis. Don’t worry, Bob Schieffer made the same mistake. Perhaps to add clarity, Trump could invite all of them to the next debate, and have them sit on opposite sides of the room, or even opposite sides of Bubba. Oh yeah, Bill wished HRC happy anniversary today...the only woman in this post who may not have actually had sexual contact with Bubba.



To: kevcol

Well, at least this moo-cow doesn’t have to worry about anyone trying to sexually asault her....

So she admits to Bill Clinton messing around constantly on his “best friend” with many, many, many different women. Got it.

To: kevcol

I’ll be convinced when she has them all on her show and apologizes to them personally, then gives them a forum to explain their side without snide interruption. Are you up for that challenge, Joy?

To: kevcol

I’m done giving these low class liberals a pass because they apologize. First, they are not sorry they said what they said, they are sorry they got caught. Second, they never accept an apology from a Republican or conservative. So, Joy and her ilk can go to hell.



To: kevcol

A pretend comedian who’s just an old bully.

FUJB reinforces the point about democrat women Compared to Conservative Women.....

To: JamesP81

I wonder if ‘the view’ got a lot of push back which prompted the apology. I think there is a huge underswelling over this and the hypocrisy of the left and media.

To: kevcol

Yeah, she’s saying it was “their fault” they were groped, assaulted, and raped. I’ve been thinking how the Clintons are like a big allegorical picture. Bill raped women, used them — he tricked them into being alone with him and then threatened them and forced himself on women who had no interest in being intimate with him. He got a kick out of hurting them. And Hillary is a mirror image of him, only besides sexual predation (if you look around there are accounts of her in the same vein) she wants to rape us economically and every other way - and force HER will on us “everyday Americans.”

How is it that she can apologize for something she venomously said yesterday but Trump cannot for something he said 11 years ago. Trump’s remarks were not directed in public to a certain individual.



To: kevcol

Her ugly a$$ needs to be fired.

No. Just Liar. The only thing that might sexually assault her is a horny desperate and lonely camel.

You usually don’t see much of Joy Behar until they drag her out and gas her up for the Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade.

She did not apologize to or about Slick’s victims, only sexual assault and/or victims in general. She meant what she said about all of Slick’s conquests.
