On seizing a moment





Blueboard

Ma. Lourdes Veneracion-Rallonza



Most of the time, we only get one shot. There may be other opportunities -- each related and building on each other -- but they will not be the same as that one singular moment to make a difference, explicitly, distinctively, emphatically.

I am very conscious of the importance of a moment.



Of course, mine was but a minute example of seizing the moment, a personal one, if I may say. However, in a country currently in the thick of electoral spectacle, doing the same for a societal concern would definitely be a huge challenge.



A few days ago, the Transitional Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC) publicly launched its Report in Cotabato City and Manila. The TJRC Report was much awaited by various publics, particularly, by those from affected Bangsamoro communities that shared their insights and stories related to the mandate areas of the TJRC, namely, legitimate grievances, historical injustice, human rights violations, and marginalization through land dispossession.



At the onset, the TJRC was guided by a gender-perspective and ensured that women and their experiences are explicitly included in the Consultation Process and reflected in the text of the Report. This was a very significant endeavor given the fact that there are very few transitional justice processes around the world that have paid attention to gender at the very start of their work. In fact, during the second international meeting of the Global Action Against Mass Atrocity Crimes (GAMAAC) held in Manila last February 2016, Pablo de Greiff, UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion of Truth, Justice, Reparation, and Guarantees of Non-Recurrence, shared his observation that most of the time, transitional justice entities do not immediately adopt a gender-perspective. Only a few exceptions can be identified, such as Colombia’s Historical Memory Group (Grupo de Memoria Historica) and Morocco’s Equity and Reconciliation Commission (Instance Equitl et Réet Rliation) that included gender in the construction of memory narratives and investigation of human rights violations in their transitional justice work, respectively.



The TJRC Report mapped out the gender dimensions of legitimate grievance, historical injustice, human rights violations, and marginalization through land dispossession and reflected a narrative where gender intersected with culture and identity and the historicity of violence, impunity, and neglect in the Bangsamoro. For example, in the context of pre-and during Martial Law, atrocity crimes committed against women underscored the convergence of violence with gender and culture. As the TJRC Report stated and I quote:



“The widespread commission of rape and other acts of violence by government armed forces and auxiliaries against Moro and indigenous women was a wanton display of power meant to demoralize enemy’ men for their failure to protect their women. In this context, rape, in particular, was more than an act of sexual violence -- it signified power over the other’ as Moro. Women were victimized, not just because they were women, but because they were Moro women.”



In light of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) committed during this period, the TJRC notes that “a formal investigation of this matter is warranted to ensure the accountability for past abuse and to prevent the recurrence of such violations in the future.”



Such view, in my mind, already has several precedents.



Foremost, in the context of international legal standards, rape and sexual violence have been identified as war crimes and crimes against humanity in several international humanitarian law instruments such as the Geneva Conventions and its Additional Protocols. Secondly the statutes and jurisprudence of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda have recognized rape and SGBV as crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crimes constitutive of genocide and ethnic cleansing.’ And third, country-based tribunals and courts -- such as the Special War Crimes Tribunal in Bangladesh, the Justice and Peace Chamber of the Bogota High Tribunal in Colombia, and court in Guatemala -- investigated and prosecuted crimes committed, including rape and SGBV, during past civil war/armed conflict in their countries.



The TJRC Report brings to light a Bangsamoro opportunity’ in place of the commonly perceived Bangsamoro problem.’ This is a political statement in need of a moment -- a moment for all of us to deal with our past, a moment for truth-seeking and accountability, a moment for transforming mind-sets and relations toward reconciliation. And yes, this is a moment when Bangsamoro and indigenous women are included themselves, not represented by others, but through their own meaningful participation. Thus, in the context of surfacing atrocity crimes committed against these women, that moment will come and they will seize it for themselves to make a difference, explicitly, distinctively, and emphatically.

mrallonza@ateneo.edu For example, last 13 March, on the occasion of the turnover ceremony of the Women and Peace Center in Panglima Sugala by the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process and the Regional Commission on Bangsamoro Women to the Provincial Government of Tawi-Tawi, I was requested to deliver a lecture on women empowerment. I had a prepared lecture, complete with the usual powerpoint presentation slide, but at the moment I was called, I decided not to use the prepared lecture I had. I instead engaged in a conversation about women’s empowerment based on what and how the people present experienced it. I went around the whole gymnasium, asking the women who were there, the men who just happen to stop by to see what was happening, and even the children playing around. I had to seize the moment -- I needed to somehow try something that people would remember our conversation and reflect on the meaning it has for them.” It was my one shot, at that exact point in time, to facilitate a collective exercise to think about women’s empowerment.Of course, mine was but a minute example of seizing the moment, a personal one, if I may say.
