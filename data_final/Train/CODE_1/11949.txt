The church opposes capital punishment, but it is a desperate situation, says priest

Death sentences for Islamic militants who massacred 45 people will not deter future terrorist acts, says a Catholic Church official in Pakistan.

"Whether or not these hangings make a difference remains to be seen. Generally people take solace in these verdicts but I cannot see any tangible difference," said Father Emmanuel Yousaf Mani, director of the Pakistani bishops' justice and peace commission.

For a difference to occur, he urged changes be made in Pakistan's education system, which will help counter radicalization.

"Personally we are against capital punishment, but we have a desperate situation in the country. People are being killed for their faith and the judges or lawyers in civilian court are being threatened," Father Mani told ucanews.com.

However, he said the punishment would bring some satisfaction to the victim's families.

Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff, General Raheel Sharif, confirmed the death sentences on five "hardcore terrorists" who massacred 45 people, including 16 women, on a community bus in Karachi May 13, 2015. Those killed were from the Shia Muslim religious minority group.

The general also said that the militants had been convicted over the April 24, 2015 killing of 40-year-old social worker and human rights activist Sabeen Mahmud who was shot as she was driving with her mother.

Jundullah, a Taliban splinter group, who have pledged allegiance to the so-called Islamic State, claimed responsibility for the carnage.

The Pakistan military said the convicted militants were also involved in attack on a mosque belonging to Bohras, another Muslim religious minority group.
