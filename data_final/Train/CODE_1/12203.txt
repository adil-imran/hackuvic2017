PanARMENIAN.Net - The results of the meeting of Armenian and Azerbaijani Presidents pave the way for cautious optimism on the situation in Nagorno Karabakh, a Kremlin spokesman said Tuesday, May 17.

President Serzh Sargsyan and his Azerbaijani counterpart Ilham Aliyev participated in a meeting on the Nagorno Karabakh conflict settlement in Vienna on Monday, May 16. The summit was the first one since the escalation in the Nagorno Karabakh conflict zone.

Asked if Kremlin thinks the severe phase of the conflict has already passed, Dmitry Peskov said: “Of course, and our Foreign Minister has offered necessary assessments on the issue. We want to hope that there are grounds for cautious optimism allowing the establishment of stability.”

The parties to the Nagorno Karabakh conflict agreed to ensure compliance with the ceasefire of 1994-1995, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said after the presidential summit.

"Compromise between Armenia and Azerbaijan on the conflict is possible, but given the current situation, reaching the goal will be gradual," he said.
