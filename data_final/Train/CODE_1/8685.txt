Libya: 2.4 Million People in Need of Humanitarian Aid

TEHRAN (FNA)- The UN used World Humanitarian Day to plead for help for Libya, saying millions of Libyans and migrants were engulfed in a worsening crisis.

“More than 2.4 million people in Libya are in need of humanitarian assistance,” Martin Kobler, the UN secretary-general’s special representative for Libya, said in a statement on Friday, Indian express reported.

“They lack medicines, vaccinations and suffer from poor hospitalization services. Almost 300,000 children are out of schools and almost 350,000 Libyans are displaced within the country.”

Kobler also noted the predicament of more than 270,000 migrants who fled their home countries and are stranded in Libya.

“The humanitarian needs created by the crisis in Libya are enormous and this should serve as an incentive for us to do our utmost to give hope to the people, particularly those in urgent need of humanitarian assistance,” he added.

The latest fighting is centered on the coastal city of Sirte, where pro-government forces are pressing an assault against the ISIL.
