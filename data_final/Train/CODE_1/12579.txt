A MIGRANT trying to claim asylum has been unmasked as a suspected TERRORIST – after he was caught posing a shocking weapons stash.

EPA ARSENAL: A shocking image of the 'refugee' posing with guns, grenades and ammo has emerged

A 34-year-old man who arrived in Europe with his family claiming to be a Syrian refugee has been arrested on suspicion of plotting to massacre civilians. Police uncovered a photo of the suspect – now believed to be an Algerian terrorist – clutching a pistol and posing with grenades, machine guns, ammo cartridges, a helmet, military-style webbing and a backpack. The suspected ISIS terrorist and his wife were among three people arrested as 450 heavily-armed police raided properties – including two refugee centres.

The arrested couple reportedly arrived in Germany claiming to be fleeing Syria's bloody civil war at the end of 2015. The third suspect – a man – was arrested over fake identification documents. Experts say Germany is long overdue a terrorist attack due to its support for military operations against Islamic State – also known as Daesh – in Iraq and Syria. Germany took in more than 1.1 million asylum seekers last year – with another 91,674 arriving last month alone – and the country's top spook warned ISIS was deliberately planting terrorists among asylum seekers. **CLICK HERE FOR WARNING SYRIAN CIVIL WAR TURNING INTO WW3**
