There are many positive benefits to the recent success and continuing efforts to grow agricultural tourism on Kauai. The Kauai Office of Economic Development is keenly interested in exploring and expanding this line of profitability because it is simply a win/win all the way around. Local farmers partner with restaurants or other farmers and small local business people to produce sought after local products such as body treatments, jellies, soaps, cookies, sherbets and ice cream and many more products as well as regionally sourced cuisine that leaves tourists impressed, and feeling connected with Kauai in a deeper way than simply visiting our lovely beaches â€” which they can do for free once they arrive.
