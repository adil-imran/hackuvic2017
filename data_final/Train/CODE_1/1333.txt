The Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, yesterday said unless the country was restructured, it would be difficult for it to wriggle itself out of security challenges, pervasive poverty and retarded growth.

Ekweremadu was quoted in a statement by his media aide, Uche Anichukwu, as speaking in New York, the United States of America, during the 2016 Convention of the World Igbo Congress (WIC).

“Successive military regimes reneged on the core ingredients of a federal structure agreed upon by our founding fathers at various constitutional conferences leading up to independence as the basis of the Nigerian union,” he said.“Over the years, we have moved from a strong and viable three-regional federal structure to a weak, spendthrift and unwieldy 36-state structure; we moved from a decentralised police system that allowed the federating units to take greater charge of security of lives and property in their territories to a centralised police system in which one man at the centre pretends to be in full charge of security of lives and property in the creeks of the Niger Delta, the cocoa farms of the South-west, the expansive land mass of the North and the hinterlands of the South-east,” he added.Senator Ikweremadu said the cost of governance is high, states can no longer pay salaries because the nation has moved “from fiscal federalism which encouraged productivity and competitive development to a feeding bottle federalism that runs on free oil money, encouraging indolence, corruption, and lack of creativity in governance.”On attacks by suspected herders, he called on affected states to pass legislations restricting cattle rearing to modern ranches, while also setting up forest rangers to enforce such laws.“This will produce healthier animals, give better products, provide employment, added value to the farm products, and help in promoting peaceful co-existence as well as sifting armed bandits and terrorists from real farmers doing legitimate business, “he said.Senator Ekweremadu, however, warned that enforcement of such measures should not be left entirely in the hands of federal security agencies.“Sadly, when you enact laws to check the menace, as Ekiti State has commendably done, you will still rely on the same security institutions to enforce them. This is the dilemma. Therefore, our state governments should take further steps by ensuring that such legislations provide for enforcement bodies such as Forest Rangers which will consistently comb the forests to ensure that those who run foul of the laws are arrested and speedily prosecuted to serve as deterrent to others, “he said.
