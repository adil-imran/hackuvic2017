Kuwait called on its citizens in Lebanon on Wednesday to leave the country, making it the latest Gulf country to issue a travel warning.

Unless they have pressing issues to stay in the country, citizens are advised to leave Lebanon, said a statement from Kuwaiti embassy in Beirut

These citizens were urged “exercise caution” in the country, reported Kuwait News Agency.

They should avoid “unsafe areas and contact the embassy and coordinate with it at times of need.”

Qatar later issued a similar warning.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain had issued travel warnings to their citizens on Tuesday, citing “safety” concerns.

Saudi Arabia decided last week to halt a $4 billion grant to the Lebanese army and security forces and to review its diplomatic relations with Lebanon. The stance came after Lebanon's foreign ministry declined to vote in favor of Saudi-backed resolutions against Iran during two meetings of Arab and Muslim foreign ministers.

It also followed fierce anti-Saudi statements by Hizbullah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.

Announcing its decision on Friday, the kingdom deplored "political and media campaigns inspired by Hizbullah against Saudi Arabia," as well as what it called the group's "terrorist acts against Arab and Muslim nations."

In a statement, Hizbullah said Saudi Arabia stopped the military aid because of economic pressures from the war in Yemen, where it leads an Arab military coalition fighting Iran-backed rebels, and lower oil revenues.

The $3 billion deal funded military equipment provided by France and was to ship vehicles, helicopters, drones, artillery and other equipment to Lebanon.
