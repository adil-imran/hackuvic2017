Islamic State confirms Jihadi John's death

The Islamic State on Tuesday confirmed that Mohammed Emwazi, the British national known as Jihadi John, was killed in an airstrike last year. The car Emwazi was riding in was "targeted in a strike by an unmanned drone in the city of ar-Raqqah, destroying the car and killing him instantly," a media outlet associated with the Islamist extremist group reported. British Prime Minister David Cameron said after the November airstrike that Emwazi, who was seen in videos showing the beheadings of Western hostages, was a "barbaric murderer," and the strikes by British and American drones was "the right thing to do."
