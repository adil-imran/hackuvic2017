Friday’s school shooting in northern Saskatchewan brought back painful memories for Rev. Dale Lang.

Lang, an Alberta father who lost his son in a school shooting nearly 17 years ago, recalled the horror of that day.

“It’s hard to imagine a more painful situation for people than losing a child,” said Rev. Dale Lang.

“It’s something no one should ever have to go through. Now there’s more people going through the same thing.”

On April 28, 1999, a 14-year-old student walked into Taber’s W.R. Myers high school and opened fire with a sawed-off .22 calibre rifle, killing Lang’s 17-year-old son Jason and injuring another boy.

The incident took place eight days after the Columbine high school massacre in Colorado.

Lang recalled the tension and confusion as he was told over the phone that Jason had been rushed to hospital.

When he learned it was a school shooting, Lang was shocked.

“It’s hard to imagine you’re actually sitting there, waiting to hear news about something so unbelievable,” he said.

When Lang’s son died, the former Anglican minister and his wife turned to their faith.

Despite their pain and anger, they tried to find forgiveness for their son’s killer, who was the victim of severe bullying from a young age.

“It didn’t make me angry at him, it made me feel sad for him,” said Lang.

“Our faith allowed us to forgive this young man, as early on as the memorial service for our son,” which was just five days after Jason’s death.
