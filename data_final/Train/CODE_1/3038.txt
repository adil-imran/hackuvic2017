Rebels and residents of a long-besieged Damascus suburb reached a rare deal with the Syrian regime to evacuate the town within 72 hours.

Thursday's agreement came nearly four years after President Bashar al-Assad's regime laid siege to the town of Daraya, on the outskirts of the capital, part of a tactic to force opposition-held areas across the country to surrender.

During years of siege Daraya received only two humanitarian aid convoys, both this past June. The deliveries were criticized by residents for bringing in unneeded items such as lice shampoo and only small amounts of food and other basic goods at a time many of its 8,400 civilians were suffering from malnutrition.

The town also has increasingly come under attack from Syrian airstrikes and a ground offensive that has seen the loss of the farming fields relied on by starving residents.

Under the evacuation deal, Daraya's civilians will be allowed to move to other Damascus suburbs including the town of Kesweh, which is divided under rebel and regime control, Daraya opposition officials said.

The town's rebels will be taken to the northwest province of Idlib, which is almost entirely under opposition control. The opposition fighters will be allowed to bring individual firearms but are to leave behind heavy weapons, residents and the officials said.

"Of course there is fear that the regime will go back on its word," said Hytham Ghazal, manager of the humanitarian office in Daraya. "The regime can betray us at any moment, but we have reached the point where we have no other choice."

Syrian state media confirmed the deal and said 700 "militants" would "hand their heavy and medium weapons to the Syrian Arab Army." Another 4,000 civilian men and women would be transferred to shelters along with their families, it said.

The June deliveries were closely followed by the dropping of hundreds of barrel bombs-oil drums packed with explosives-in what appeared to be a regime practice of allowing in humanitarian aid only to then carry out punishment.

The situation became even more dire in recent weeks, with barrel bombs supplemented by napalm bombs that incinerated homes and buildings, residents and local opposition officials said. The bombs' force, and the fires they caused, meant even those hiding in their basements were unsafe, they added.

The town's only hospital was destroyed last week in one such napalm attack, leaving thousands of injured residents and fighters without medical care, said local activist Muhammad Zakaria.
