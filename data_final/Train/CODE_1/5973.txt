GAZA CITY (Alresalah.ps) -- Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas had slammed

remarks of the Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon over

resistance tunnels.



In a press statement Sunday, the Movement stressed that the tunnels are

defensive, noting that they were built for the purpose of fending the Gaza

Strip against invasion by the Israeli forces.



Those remarks are prejudiced in favor of the Israeli occupation. The

statement read, noting Ki-Moons involvement in covering up the Israeli

massacre in Rafah in 2014 known as Black Friday.
