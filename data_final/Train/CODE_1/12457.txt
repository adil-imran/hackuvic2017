Three days of mourning will be observed in Belgium and a minute's silence for the victims will be held today at midday local time

A minute's silence for the victims will be held at midday local time.

The international manhunt for the Brussels suicide bombers' accomplice continued on Wednesday morning as Islamic State terrorists warned of further "dark days" ahead for anyone who opposed them.Meanwhile Belgium is observing three days of mourning following the bomb attacks, which left 34 people dead and about 250 wounded.Investigators are focusing on whether CCTV footage captured moments before the airport blasts shows two of the three suspected terrorists wearing single gloves to hide detonators. Zaventem's mayor Francis Vermeiren told AFP the explosives were stowed in their luggage and detonated before reaching the security gate.The Belgian police Twitter account for appeals issued the latest photos, which also show close-ups of the two men believed to be dead, and asked for information from anyone who recognised them.A taxi driver who had driven the three suspects to the airport led police to the Schaerbeek area of Brussels where another bomb and an IS flag were among items recovered.The attacks, condemned as "blind, violent and cowardly" by Charles Michel, Belgian prime minister, happened four days after the arrest of Salah Abdeslam, who plotted November's massacre in Paris. Detectives are yet to rule out a direct link between the attacks.
