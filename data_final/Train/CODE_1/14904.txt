Letter: Lessons from Bosnia

Like many young Americans, I have followed this presidential election more closely than any other in my lifetime. But I am watching it unfold from afar while living in the small, post-conflict nation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.



To those back home, Bosnia might seem a far cry from life in New Hampshire, a place with little relation to events unfolding on American soil. Yet of all places, perhaps Bosnia is the one we should look to most in order to understand the risks of scare tactics employed by Republican hopefuls throughout this race.



Bosnians are all too familiar with this story. When Yugoslavia fell apart in the 1990s, nationalist leaders used fear as a tool of manipulation, turning harmonious communities into bloody power-grabs overnight. When the smoke cleared, Bosnians had experienced the worst atrocities in Europe since World War II, while many wartime leaders made off with large profits.



We must learn from the past when our presidential candidates employ the same language that has been used to justify ghettos, ethnic cleansing and yes, genocide, throughout history.



President Obama’s speech at the Islamic Society of Baltimore encouraged Americans not to be “bystanders to bigotry.” I fear we have crossed that line already.



The outcome of this election will not absolve our national conscience of what has transpired in this race. When the votes are cast, we must pause for a moment of national reflection. We must begin the difficult, but critical, work of making our country tolerant and safe again.
