Syria: Mass Grave Unearthed in Aleppo Province

TEHRAN (FNA)- Manbij military council disclosed that a mass grave of the civilians massacred by the ISIL terrorists was found in the the recently-liberated town of Manbij in Aleppo province.

An alliance of Kurdish-Arab forces in Syria discovered dozens of graves of people killed by the ISIL Takfiri terrorist group in Manbij in Aleppo province.

According to the Manbij military council, the 27 undocumented graves, which were found on Friday, hold the remains of civilians, who had attempted to escape the town when it was under the control of ISIL, but had been killed by the terrorists.

The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) seized full control over the Northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border on August 12, after the last remaining ISIL terrorists, who had been using civilians as human shields, escaped.

The Military Council of Manbij in Aleppo province announced that over 4,000 terrorists have been killed in tough battle with the predominantly Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces since the beginning of Manbij liberation operations.
