A senior Egyptian al Qaida figure fighting in Syria has been killed in a US drone strike, an opposition monitoring group and relatives said.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Rifai Ahmad Taha was killed in a strike on Tuesday in the north-western Idlib province.

Before joining al Qaida, Taha was a top figure in Egypt's notorious militant group Gamaa Islamiya, which massacred 58 foreign tourists in the ancient Egyptian city of Luxor in 1997. He was also allied with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.
