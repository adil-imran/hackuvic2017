Police also subjected the couple to brutal torture, sources informed The Nation yesterday.



According to sources, Additional District and Sessions Judge Rana Zahid dispatched a bailiff to police station Waris Khan in a complaint filed against illegal detention through Advocate Rabia Ishaq.

Advocate Rabia Ishaq, while talking to The Nation, said that brother of Irshad approached her for recovery of his brother and his sister-in-law.

The lawyer further said that the complainant said that a woman namely Sajida Bibi had accused his sister-in-law Shabana of stealing cash and jewellery from her house where Shabana worked as domestic servant.

The police following the complaint picked up the couple and allegedly tortured them without registering the case.
