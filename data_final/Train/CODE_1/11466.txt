One of the zionist major tools to face the growing BDS is to portray “israel” as a modern industrial country that the world “cant live without their genius products”. They try to beautify the Zionist achievements in technology and especially in the hi-tech industries and to promote the Intel, Microsoft, Siemens and other European industries as theirs, and that every computer has an “ israeeli” component within it. This is crucial for the Zionist simply because their economy depends precisely on this.

Most of the Hi-tech companies operating in “israel” are western companies that if they withdraw it will mean the collapse of the Zionist “inventive mind” of high-tech, and this would deprive them from one of their major prides using the modern Western inventions attributing it to themselves and their “genius jewish mind”.
