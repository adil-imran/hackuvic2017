Israel has been accused of “ethnic cleansing” against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. This follows an increase in the destruction of Palestinian houses and buildings in the area.

The demolition work is clearing the land in order to prepare it for further Israeli settlements. The area covers 360,000 hectares, equal to 60 percent of the West Bank. The demolitions have alarmed world diplomats and human rights groups over what they call the Tel Aviv regime’s continued violation of international law.

The UN says reconstruction aid to more than 1,350 Gazan families has been suspended after Israel blocked private imports of cement.

This crisis is an addition to Israel's blockade enforced since 2007. Meanwhile, Israel has claimed the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas is diverting the supplies.We ask the public how many Israelis they think live in settlements on Palestinian land. Why can Israel prevent Palestinians from rebuilding their homes? And what pressure should the British government put on Israel?

These are the simple questions we sought to answer.
