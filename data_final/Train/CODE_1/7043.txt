GENEVA, May 24 -- The continuing massacre in Rwanda has caused refugee populations in neighboring Tanzania to swell to more than 322, 000, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Tuesday.

Spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said the Benako camp, 28 miles (45 km) from the Tanzanian-Rwandan border, houses more than 272,000 refugees, making it the largest refugee camp in the world.

'Benako has too many refugees to take care of, distribution is difficult, there's a terrible strain on water supplies, so we have identified two new sites that will each house 75,000 refugees,' Foa said.

UNHCR said the two new camps in Lumase and Katosa have their own water supplies and the refugees will be moved in the next few days.

The fighting and mass killings between the tribal-based Hutu and Tutsi forces began seven weeks ago, after the death of Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana in a mysterious plane crash. Estimates of a death toll in the central African nation range from 200,000 to 500,000, and more than a million civilians have sought shelter in makeshift refugee camps along Rwanda's borders with Tanzania, Burundi and Zaire.
