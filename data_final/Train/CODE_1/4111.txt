(Rest of Headline: and Third-Party Risks)

[snip]When it comes to the most urgent issue facing our country and the world, the choice in this election is extremely clear, Gore told the crowd at Miami Dade University. Hillary Clinton will make solving the climate crisis a top national priority. Her opponent based on the ideas that he has presented would take us towards a climate catastrophe.

Harping on the same old tax you and to put an end to Capitalism but bigger government ....Gore and Clinton hope this bit of truth does not become knowledge for Global Warming Believers and Climate Change cults:

Meanwhile the ManBearPig: —Lives in San Francisco—where the city killer earthquake is just a matter of time and will almost certainly happen long before any climate change (man made or otherwise) will mean much of anything

—Jets around the country wasting fossil fuels What a joke!

Good, hope he continues to pull Hillary down by promoting this BS.

catastrophe......is Al Gore and the rest of them, it will be if they get this. For us.

How about the Global Masseuse Catastrophe? Al should tell us how he’ll cool their environment.



To: yoe

At this juncture virtually everyone knows what the deal is. Therefore the people who go along with this want to take us down, or are poised to profit handsomely from the scam and don’t care if America survives or not.

I hope the folks in W.V., Pennsylvania, in the energy industry, are watching and taking note. Their jobs are gone under Hillary and she is going to appoint Al Gore to some position in charge of the EPA or energy.

The crazed sex poodle is barking up the wrong tree.



To: yoe

Can someone please provide all the reduced ice, lowland flooding, increased hurricanes that Gore claimed that hasn't happened? I ask because I don't have all that handy. I'd like to send the current facts to Hellary and her Gorebot. I've seen the satellite photos of last winters' polar ice sheets which are still there contrary to his remarks that northern ice sheet would be gone by now (poor polar bears). I've not read of any increased sea levels. And watched our hurricanes seasons not grow, but reduce in the last decade. Is there a chart some where to compare and contrast?



To: nickedknack

Ocean front property too. Isn’t he afraid the sea level rise will take it out?

Al Gore behaved like crazed sex poodle with masseuse A masseuse has accused Al Gore, the former US vice president, of sexually assaulting her at an Oregon hotel during a global warming lecture tour in 2006. Tom Leonard

24 Jun 2010 The unidentified 54-year-old woman gave police a detailed account of her claims that Mr Gore groped and kissed her in an aggressive attempt to have sex during a night-time appointment in his suite. However, the police concluded that there was insufficient evidence to press charges. The woman, who recalled telling Mr Gore he was behaving like a crazed sex poodle, claims he pinned her to his bed and forcibly French kissed her. Mr Gore, 62, was staying in an expensive hotel in Portland in October while delivering a speech about climate change in October of that year had registered as Mr Stone. He allegedly asked the hotel to call the massage therapist to his suite, complaining to her during the $540 session about the physical rigours of his heavy travel schedule. The accuser, after contacting police in late 2006, subsequently cancelled three interviews with detectives and said she did not want the investigation to proceed. However, she contacted them again in January 2009 and gave a detailed statement. A spokesman for Mr Gore, who announced his separation from his wife, Tipper, on June 1, said he had no comment. In her statement, made public by police, the masseuse said she arrived at the St Lucia Hotels VIP suite to find Mr Gore drinking beer. He greeted her with a hug and told her to call him Al, she told police. However, the nearly three-hour therapy session soon went sour after Mr Gore angrily insisted she massage him around his groin and then pounced on her, she claimed. He pleaded, groped me, grabbed me, engulfed me in embrace, tongue kissed me, massaged me, grabbed my breasts, she told detectives. She said she feared he might rape her as he flipped me flat on my back and threw his whole body face down over atop me, pinning me down and outweighing me by quite a bit. The woman said Mr Gore provided a dramatic display of violent temper as well as [an] extremely dictatorial, commanding attitude besides his smiley, global warming concern persona. Having squirmed out of his grasp, she fled his suite. She claimed she later found stains on the front of her trousers and kept them uncleaned as evidence, believing they were his body fluids. The masseuse told police she had not immediately called them as I feared being made into a public spectacle and my reputation being destroyed. ... http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/7852300/Al-Gore-behaved-like-crazed-sex-poodle-with-masseuse.html

Also need a pic of his yacht (the size of small Navy ships) and his private jet aircraft, any other properties.

"Time for folks to resurrect the GRIFTER Al Gores predictions from the 20th century - NONE of which came true." Yup, I asked on another thread if anyone has a back-to-back list or chart of Gorebot's predictions compared to today's reality.



To: nickedknack

Thank you. It’s a saver.



To: nickedknack

Thank you.



To: yoe

The “crazed sex poodle” who assaulted a masseuse at a ritzy hotel, was Hillary’s honored speaker today. That was 10 years ago - so it doesn’t matter? Double standard, once again.

Thank you, again. I’m building a Gorebot carbon footprint file for that hypocrite. I don’t have a graphics client and don’t want one because of the requirement to give an email address, but once I compile the photos and his predictions to current reality, I will forward all via Freepmail or other. This waste of oxygen can easily be taken down.

Campaigning With Hillary Clinton, Al Gore Warns of ‘Climate Catastrophe’ and Third-Party Risks

___________________________________________ Those were the days my friends...MUST WATCH. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ONgInPK7WI Looks like Hillary didn’t reveal her tax statements during this time. HA! Look at all the pardons attached directly to the Clinton’s and the monies they received.



To: yoe

Al Gore’s facial expression when a protester interrupted HIl’s speech with BILL CLINTON IS A RAPIST... followed by infowars.com I believe. Al just looked like a deer in headlights... it was particularly funny as CNN had just mentioned how he didn’t want Bill stumping for him at the time, and it may have cost him the election...lolol I love the fact these young lads are running around doing this! Thanks to Alex Jones of infowars.com



To: yoe

Funny - Gore apparently mentioned last weekend’s Hurricane Matthew as an example of the coming catastrophe due to climate change - we had rain all day last Saturday and much of Sunday as Matthew passed by - we were supposed to have clear weather, but suddenly on Saturday the computer models and simulations which for four days had shown Matthew curving back down south proved wrong, and it went out to sea north east - they can’t even predict what’s happening overnight with something as well-defined as a hurricane, but they can project that in fifty years the temperature will climb 3.78 degrees and the sea-levels rise 6.93109 inches due to climate change - absurd......



To: yoe

regarding third party risks I have traveled 12 states in the last three weeks, on and off interstates I am visiting in New Mexico now There are some Trump signs

There are as many Johnson signs

There are a few greenie woman signs

There are no Hillary signs In other states

There are Johnson signs but mostly here in NM

There are no Hillary signs anywhere to be seen In other states there are no Hilary signs at all Her support is invisible

“Hillary Clinton will make...” I’m reaching the conclusion that Hillary can’t make anything. She’s old, without energy, without brightness, and probably actually sick. She’s a CINO (Candidate In Name Only). It’s actually the media that’s running against Trump. If Trump loses he can be proud knowing that he lost to thousands of media people, not Hillary. The media aren’t merely her fans. They are ‘her’ because she is no longer ‘her’. And if Hillary wins she will be a figurehead that’s makes occasional appearances to read scripts. Other unelected, unknown, people who won’t put America first will run things. Congress and the Senate will take direction from those unknown people. Getting back to Hillary, we see that she needs to be told when to smile in her speech notes. She had no originality in her debate. Her answers mainly were “go to my website” or “everything he said is wrong”. We seldom see her in public. No real press conferences. Small unenergetic audiences. Where is Hillary? Whenever you see a mainstream talker, there’s Hillary.



To: Intolerant in NJ

“Climate Scientists are geniuses and your job is to believe and obey. Any questions?” Love, Hillary



To: cymbeline

I think the establishment’s plan is for Hillary to die in office from (insert favorite disease here...) and get child molestor Kaine as the figure head President. Then the elites will plunder the country at will.



To: Extremely Extreme Extremist



Well the picture of Mt. Etna erupting is mighty convincing however, (snopes is correct) ....I do hate to admit it however, do like the graphic *~*
