Republicans Overseas Luxembourg and the American Chamber of Commerce in Luxembourg (AMCHAM) are organising a lunch event on Terrorism's Impact on the Business World on Wednesday 9 March 2016 at the Cercle Munster (5-7 rue Münster, L-2160 Luxembourg-Grund).

Terrorism is on the rise. 13 November Paris Terrorist Attacks to the San Bernardino massacre by Islamic State Jihadis - we are all impacted. Is there a trend of terrorist attacks in the workplace or business world? How does terrorism impact your business and safety in the work place? These are questions increasingly on the mind of entrepreneur and employee alike.



The guest speaker will be anti-terrorist expert Jean Labrique who is currently Secretary General of Western Defense Studies Institute, a think-tank organisation based in Rome, focused on Homeland Security, Criminal Investigations, Counter-Terrorism and Crisis-Management. Mr. Labrique has over 30 years of experience in counter-terrorism and intelligence and has been advisor on such matters to Governments and Multinationals alike.



The presentation and discussion by Mr. Labrique will cover the following:



- A summary of the nature of Terrorism in today's world

- Terrorist attacks in the work place - is this a serious threat?



- Security in the workplace - the current state of affairs and best practices



- The unthinkable - how to protect yourself in a Terrorist attack?
