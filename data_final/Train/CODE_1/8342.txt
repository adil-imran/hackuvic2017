On Thursday, Secretary of State John Kerry declared that the self-titled Islamic State (Daesh) has been perpetrating genocide, targeting Christians, Yazidis, Shiite Muslims and other minorities in areas under its control.

There had been growing calls for the United States to declare Daeshâ€™s actions in Iraq and Syria a genocide. A number of independent and international agencies had already presented comprehensive reports that left little doubt of the horrifying tragedy taking place.

Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives did something rare in these partisan times. Members voted unanimously to call the crimes against humanity, war crimes and ethnic cleansing in Iraq and Syria by their true name: genocide.

The Florida Holocaust Museum teaches about the Holocaust to remind the world of what happens when decent people act as bystanders, taking no responsibility and action.

We applaud the U.S. House and the State Department for taking this important first step in ending the genocide and atrocities perpetrated against minorities in Iraq and Syria.

We urge you to contact your representatives in Congress and the Obama administration to ask them to continue moving forward quickly to protect the remaining at-risk populations and to hold the perpetrators of this ongoing genocide accountable.
