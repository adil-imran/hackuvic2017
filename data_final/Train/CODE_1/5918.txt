IRGC Commander: Israel, S. Arabia Lavishly Spending to Make Iran Insecure

TEHRAN (FNA)- Commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari warned of Riyadh and Tel Aviv's collaboration in attempts to foment insecurity inside Iran, saying that the two hostile states are making hefty expenses for their schemes against Tehran.

"Saudi Arabia, the Zionists and the world arrogant powers are spending huge amounts of money to stir insecurity in our country and we have intel indicating that Saudi Arabia is collaborating with the Zionists to this end," General Jafari said, addressing a forum in the Northeastern province of North Khorassan on Tuesday.

He, meantime, expressed pleasure that despite enemies' attempts, the Iranian provinces enjoy a high level of security, specially in Southeastern Iran.

General Jafari also underlined Iran's military capabilities, and said today Iran is an established power both in area of military and in building different arms and equipment.

His remarks came one month after the IRGC dismantled a team of 9 terrorists "sent by Saudi Arabia to foment insecurity inside the country".

The IRGC killed four of the terrorists, including their commander, and injured two others in the city of Saravan in Sistan and Balouchestan province in Southeastern Iran.

Official statements said the terrorist team which intended to carryout "sabotage acts inside Iran was disbanded by the IRGC in the Kouhak border region of Saravan city".

The IRGC also destroyed the weapons, ammunition, wireless equipment, night-vision goggles and three Toyota vehicles of the terrorists calling themselves Jeish al-Adl group.

Also in September, the Iranian intelligence and security forces dismantled a team of 12 terrorists sent by Saudi Arabia and certain trans-regional states to foment insecurity inside the country.

The terrorist team which was equipped with light and semi-heavy weapons and intended to carryout sabotage acts inside Iran was disbanded in the Western bordering areas of Sardasht city through cooperation with the IRGC forces.

Ten terrorists of the outlawed Democrat Party were also killed last month in armed clashes with the Iranian border guards in the Western province of Kurdistan.

The terrorists who were trying to sneak into the country through the Western Iranian borders in the village of Baneh and Khalfi in Sardasht region, sought to foment insecurity in Iran's Kurdistan province.

Based on the latest information, 10 terrorists of the outlawed group were killed during the clashes.
