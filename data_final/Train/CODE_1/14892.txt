PIKE COUNTY, Ohio - More details are emerging after Friday's mass shooting in a rural Ohio community that claimed the lives of eight family members.

“This is a horrible tragedy that has occurred here in Pike County,” said Attorney General Mike DeWine.

The investigation is ongoing.

1. Who were the victims?

The eight killed were all part of the Rhoden family. The shootings took place in four homes and within 30 miles.

2. How were the victims killed?

It appears that some of the family members were killed execution-style while they slept, according to DeWine.

3. What was the motive?

When asked if it seems this particular family was targeted, the sheriff replied, “I would suspect.” The family has since been given precautionary measures to take by law enforcement officials.

4. Grisly crime scene, but some survivors

One woman was killed in her bed with her 4- day-old baby “right there,” said DeWine. In addition to the newborn, two other young children survived the attack.

5. Manhunt continues

As of this moment the Pike County shooter is still at large. The sheriff warns people in the area to “lock their doors and stay alert.” The small town of Piketon, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, has 11 churches and one of the highest unemployment rates in the state.
