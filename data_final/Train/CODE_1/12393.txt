AhlulBayt News Agency - Since after the brutal Zaria_Massacre that the Nigerian Army killed 1000+ defenseless & unarmed members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria ( IMN ) under the leadership of His Eminence Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky, the Nigerian government that is dominated by a civilian - military alliance of the corrupt elites of Northern Nigeria has been finding ways to bury that heinous crime that was undoubtedly a war crime. The Nigerian government via the Nigerian Army had sponsored massive paid Advertorials in all the media outlets of Nigeria to justify that inhuman massacre and demonize the IMN.



On exactly Wednesday (03/February/2016), a meeting took place at the Hall of the Halal Fountain Hotel, Kaduna, that was facilitated by the Nigerian government and hosted by a known Saudi front in Nigeria "Supreme Council for Shari'ah in Nigeria (SCSI)" that is headed by one Dr.Ibrahim Datti Ahmad. The meeting attracted representative from neo - Wahhabi, ultra - Wahhabi and some Sunni groups in Nigeria. The meeting also invited Islamic NGOs such as MSS, FOMWAN, NACOMYO etc to give it more credibility.



Some of the characters that attended the meeting included the following:



-Manir Jafaru (Chiroman Zazzau)

-Sayyadi Ibrahim (son of Sheikh Dahiru Bauchi)

-Yakubu Musa Kafanchan (Izala)

-Abubakar Mujahid (JTI)

-Aminu Gusau (JTI)

-Nafi’u Baba Ahmad

-Namadi Musa

-Sani Abdulkadir Khalid

-Aliyu Sani etc.



In setting the agenda of the meeting, the head of SCSI Ibrahim Datti Ahmad said:



"While appreciating our contribution in the victory that has been won, we should remember the war is not over on many front, other fronts, with the BokoHaram insurgency, the resurgence for serious agitation for Biafra and restless Niger Delta militants, both of whom are aggrieved and are finding it difficult to reconcile themselves with the reality of defeat of the last election. Right now, yet another frightening battle front has emerged, which if not properly managed and properly contained, can pose a much bigger challenge to the Ummah and the country’s security, Perhaps worst than the BokoHaram problem. The latest threat is of course the Shia Movement."



From the above statement it is important to note that these people do not have a National agenda that included all Nigerians, they do not have a regional agenda that included all the components of Northern Nigeria;their agenda is a dangerous narrow pro-Saudi agenda that has all the imprints of being sponsored by the primitive regime of Saudi Arabia.



The Igbos are the third largest tribe in Nigeria, they are grossly marginalized by the present Nigerian government of President Buhari. The fact that they are agitating for a separate country means they have grievances that should be address by the Nigerian government but unfortunately their peaceful protesters are targeted & killed by the trigger happy Nigerian Army. It is also important to note the narrow mindset of the conveners of that meeting, they think the last General elections was a victory for them alone without considering the valuable contributions of all sections of Nigeria.



The chief convener of the meeting Ibrahim Datti Ahmad continued by saying:"The Shia Movement has a potential of posing a more dangerous threat considering its large numerical strength, organizational capacity, sophisticated methods of deception, its extensive tentacles through embedment in every strata of government including the armed forces, the police and the intelligence services. Added to these is their assured and we'll known foreign backers, principally Iran and Lebanon. The capacity for mischief of Iran and Hezbollah are there for all to see in Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Syria, a clear testimony of Iran's determination to fight the Sunnis, to a finish."



The reasons of the brutal Zaria massacre by the Nigerian Army and the chanting of anti-Shia slogans is now becoming clear from the above statement. It is important to note that the Saudi regime is the biggest and most effective tool of Western imperialism in the Islamic world & the present Nigerian government is now a willing tool of this Axis.



Iran and Hezbollah are not fighting against Sunnis in Syria and Iraq, they are fighting against the murderous terrorist groups of ISIS & AlQaeda that had killed tens of thousands of innocent Sunni Muslims in those countries. Iran and Hezbollah are today protecting the endangered Christian minorities of the Middle East who face genocide from Saudi-backed murderous terrorist groups. This is not mischief, this is true resistance by protecting humanity and serving the cause of humanity.



The meeting ended with resolutions that included short and long term solutions to contain what they refer to as "the growing Shia Movement in Nigeria". Part of their resolutions are:



-Work hard & to do everything humanly possible to prevent the release of Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky.



-Make the Nigerian government to ban the Arbaeen Trek that attracted millions of Nigerians in the last edition.



-Target the IMN in its peaceful programs and activities to make it violent especially in the ongoing FreeZakzaky campaign.



-Work closely with the Elrufai Judicial Inquiry Commission on the Zaria massacre to make sure the IMN is banned in Nigeria with all its activities.



-Increase the anti-Shia propaganda especially in rural areas where the IMN have made tremendous progress.



-Put pressure on Governors of Northern Nigeria to target members of IMN in their places of work, revoking the Certificate Of Occupancy of their schools and buildings.



-Put pressure on its members within the Federal Government to weed out members of IMN from the armed forces, police and other security forces. ETC



I will conclude this piece with a verse of the glorious Quran:



"They plan, and Allah plans....

Allah is the best of Planners."

-Holy Quran (8:30)
