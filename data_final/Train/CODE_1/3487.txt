MANILA: The Philippines and the United States have launched war games against the backdrop of the unusual threat of US forces being ejected from the South-East Asian nation, as its firebrand leader pivots to China.

President Rodrigo Duterte has sustained a verbal assault on the United States, the Philippines’ former colonial ruler and mutual defence partner, since he took office on June 30 in response to criticism of his deadly war on crime.

Duterte recently warned that the war games will be the last of his six-year term, and threatened to scrap a defence pact implemented by his predecessor that was meant to see more US troops in the Philippines to counter Chinese expansion in the South China Sea.

“Better think twice now because I will be asking you to leave the Philippines altogether,” Duterte, 71, said on Sunday in his latest outburst against the Americans, full of typical invective.

“The Americans, I don’t like them ... they are reprimanding me in public. So, I say: ‘Screw you’,” he said, while signalling again that he wanted to forge closer alliances with China and Russia.

Last week, Duterte also claimed the Central Intelligence Agency was plotting to assassinate him.

This came after he branded Barack Obama a “son of a w****” in response to being told that the US president planned to raise human rights concerns over his drug war.

Duterte has vowed to eradicate illegal drugs in the Philippines, warning that the nation is in danger of becoming a narco-state.

His crime war has seen more than 3,000 people killed, with the United Nations, the European Union and rights groups raising concerns about alleged extrajudicial killings and a breakdown in the rule of law.

Duterte has insisted that he is not doing anything illegal, yet at the same time said he would be “happy to slaughter” three million drug users.

He also likened his crime war to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler’s effort to exterminate Jews, but later apologised for referring to the Holocaust following an outcry.

A total of 2,000 troops from the two sides are taking part in the war games, including in waters close to flashpoint areas of the South China Sea. — AFP
