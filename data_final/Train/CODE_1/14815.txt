A grade seven student at Claude E. Garton Public School in Thunder Bay, Ont., has organized a donation drive for people forced out of their homes by the wildfire in Fort McMurray.

For twelve-year-old Sadie Cameron, the devastation in the Alberta city isn't an event that's happening thousands of kilometres away. It's personal for her, because her father works there.

"Some of his stuff is gone, and we're not sure yet of some other things. So, I feel like if my house were to burn down, I'd be really upset," she said.

Cameron recently attended We Stand Up, a local leadership conference held in Thunder Bay, and she said that gave her the confidence to transform her desire to help those waiting in evacuation centres, into an actual plan.

It began by asking her classmates for donations, and soon the project had spread to the entire school.

Parents received a suggestion list, which was recommended by officials in Alberta. It included socks, underwear, pillows and cases, towels and toiletries.

"But it all has to be new, you can't use old underwear or anything like that," noted Cameron, who said she is overwhelmed by what has been collected before the Thursday deadline.

'Amazing reaction'

It's been enough to require three trips with a pickup truck to gather all the supplies and to start packaging them for the trip west, scheduled for Monday.

"It was an amazing reaction," said Rima Mounayer, the school's principal, who is proud of the empathy and initiative her students are showing.

"They're learning a lesson of how important it is to stand together as Canadians, and as communities and help each other," she said.

For Cameron, the lesson is simple.

"I think when people help each other, it makes you feel good."
