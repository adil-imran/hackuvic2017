JAMMU: In the wake of the terror attack on Pathankot air base, security in Jammu & Kashmir especially the Air Force installations and the India-Pakistan border has been beefed up."The problem is that there may not be a specific threat but the threat (of terror attack) is always there. If we see the frequency of these things happening in the past, you need to be prepared all the time," director general of police (DGP) J&K, K Rajendra Kumar, told PTI.He said all the security-related measures have been put in place but there was always scope for improvement."We have plugged all the vulnerable infiltration routes along the border. Barricades have been put in place on the highways and checking of all the vehicles entering the state is being conducted," he said.The DGP, who held a high-level meeting to review the security arrangements in the state following the Pathankot terror attack, also toured various border areas in Jammu district."I am myself touring the areas along the India-Pakistan border in Jammu region and checking our arrangements to thwart any nefarious designs of anti-national elements," the DGP said.The top cop said that various security agencies were constantly assessing the situation in Jammu & Kashmir post the Pathankot terror attack."It is a continuous process and we keep on upgrading preparations. We cannot be taken by surprise that is why various security agencies have been monitoring the situation in the state," the DGP said.All the police stations along the Jammu-Pathankot national highway and areas on the international border (IB) have been asked to maintain extra vigil.The quick reaction teams have also been put on stand-by whereas the number of check posts on the Jammu-Pathankot highway have been increased.Security has also been tightened outside the Air Force stations and the Jammu and Srinagar airports."Security alert has been put in place at the air force stations in Jammu, Udhampur and Awantipura while security has been tightened outside the Jammu and the Srinagar airports," a senior army officer said.Following the terror attack in Pathankot, the Border Security Force (BSF) which looks after the IB in Jammu has also been asked to remain extra vigilant."Though we maintain round the clock vigil along the IB and never let our guard down, but whenever a terror attack takes place there is always a threat that some infiltrators might try to take advantage of the situation. Hence, we have asked our men to remain extra vigilant," a senior BSF officer said.
