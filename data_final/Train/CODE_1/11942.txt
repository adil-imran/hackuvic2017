UAE condemns terrorist massacres in Iraq





The United Arab Emirates has condemned, in the strongest terms, the terrorist massacres in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, which claimed the lives of dozens of innocent people.



The UAE has announced its solidarity with Iraq and its people against organised terrorist attacks, targeting its institutions and its religious, cultural and civilisational fabric.



The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation's statement added that targeting the brotherly people of Iraq is part of a division and hatred scene which affects our region and seeks, through terrorism, to feed abhorrent sectarianism.



The statement expressed sincere condolences and sympathy to the families of the victims of this terrorist act, and wished the injured a speedy recovery. â€“ Emirates News Agency, WAM - http://www.wam.ae/en/news/emirates/1395295367760.html
