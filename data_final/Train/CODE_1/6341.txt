The Islamic State claimed responsibility for Monday's car bombing and assault at a Baghdad mall that killed 18 people and wounded 50 others.

Shortly after the attack, the militant group posted a statement online, saying a car bomb and four of its fighters had targeted the area where many Shiite Muslims gather and warned of “worse” to come, the Associated Press reported.

The attack comes two weeks after the Islamic State was driven out of the western city of Ramadi by Iraqi government troops. The militant group still controls parts of northern and western Iraq, as well as a parts of Syria.

Monday's assault began with a car bomb being detonated and gunmen assaulting the mall for more than an hour before Iraqi security forces surrounded the building, landed troops on the roof and re-gained control over the shopping zone, according to the AP.

At least four police officers were killed, as well as two of the attackers, Iraqi officials told the AP. Major roads, bridges and other shopping malls were closed to guard against further attacks.

Reuters reported another car bomb in Baghdad killed five people and wounded 12; three were killed and in a car bomb attack in Baquba, northeast of Baghdad; and 20 died and 50 were wounded in twin bomb attacks in Muqdadiya.
