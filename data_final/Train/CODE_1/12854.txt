‘If this financial crisis continues, it will have a great effect on the front lines. You cannot send your fighters with empty stomachs to the fight,’ Dr Fuad Hussein told a group of journalists from American media outlets on Friday morning.

He added, ‘We need support and help. We are [in Washington] to explain this to our friends.’’

Friday marked the fourth day of a delegation from the Kurdistan Regional Government, KRG, which includes Dr Hussein, Chief of Staff to President Masoud Barzani, and Minister Falah Mustafa Bakir, Head of the KRG Department of Foreign Relations, accompanied by KRG Representative to the US Bayan Sami Abdul Rahman.

The delegation continued outreach to US Administration and defense officials, also conducting separate roundtable discussions with US journalists and humanitarian organizations.

The delegation met with National Security Council staff at the White House, including Robert Malley, Special Assistant to President Obama and Coordinator for the Middle East, and advisors of the Vice President.

The KRG officials asked the US to find ways to support the Peshmerga and the host communities, as well as the displaced. They said that the Peshmerga are ready to play a critical role in the liberation of Mosul.

Dr Hussein, Minister Bakir, and Representative Abdul Rahman met Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Elissa Slotkin to discuss the effect that the economic crisis has had on the fight against ISIS and the shared responsibility for defeating the terror group.
