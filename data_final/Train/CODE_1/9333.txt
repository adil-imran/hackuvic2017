LAHORE – The Indian consulate in Afghanistan’s Jalalabad city provided Rs 3 million to the militants in order to carry out Charsadda attack, a private TV channel reported on Wednesday.

According to details, a Taliban commander was in contact with Mullah Fazlullah – the mastermind behind the Peshawar massacre - in Afghanistan, security sources said after tracing the call of the four militants. Local media reported 0093774262593 as the number that was used by the militants to contact the mastermind behind the attack.

It may be mentioned here that at least four unidentified gunmen stormed the Bacha Khan University in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Charsadda District and opened fire on students and staff, killing 25 of them and injuring 60 others.

In a separate development, ISPR Director General Lieutenant General Asim Bajwa said that security forces had received a major information about the Charsadda attack. “We know everything about the location of the militants, from where they are operating,” he said. He added that the terrorists used Afghanistan-made SIMs.

The attack took place four days after India’s Minister for Defence Manohar Parrikar said “those who attacked us will also feel the same pain, the place and type of response would be of our choice”. On January 17, just two days ahead of today’s attack, Parrikar repeated his threatening statement in some other words.

“Our patience at Pakistan’s move against terrorists - who carried out Pathankot and Mumbai attacks - is running thin. The world will see the results in the next one year,” he had said.
