The Week That Was at Global Voices podcast takes a look at some of the stories that have recently come out of the Global Voices newsroom. This week, we speak to our contributor Endalk about protests, identity politics and state violence in Ethiopia.

We also tell you tales of tragedy, discrimination, and language activism from Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago and Australia. And Salma Essam, narrates the anguish sheâ€™s feeling on the third anniversary of the Rabaa massacre in Egypt.
