Assyrian Organizations Send Open Letter to U.S. Presidential Candidates

( Getty Images) (AINA) -- An open letter by eleven Middle Eastern, European and American Assyrian organizations has been sent to the crop of U.S. presidential candidates. The letter asks the candidates what steps they would take to stop the genocide of Assyrians, Yazidis and other groups by ISIS.

Since capturing Mosul in July, 2014, ISIS has driven 200,000 Assyrians from their villages, killed thousands of Assyrians and Yazidis, sold captured and raped Yazidi women and sold them into slavery, destroyed Assyrian archaeological sites as well as churches both in Iraq and Syria.

The letter also asks if the candidates would recognize the Turkish genocide of Assyrians, Armenians and Greeks in World War One and support reparations for the victims.

The Turkish genocide claimed the lives of 750,000 Assyrians (75%), 500,000 Greeks and 1.5 million Armenians.
