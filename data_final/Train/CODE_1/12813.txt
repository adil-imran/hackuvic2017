NEW DELHI: Distressed over being away from ‘home’ for last 26 years, displaced Kashmiri Pandits today staged a protest here demanding immediate steps for their rehabilitation and accused both the State Government and Centre of doing nothing to facilitate their return to Kashmir.

The protesters also submitted a five-point memorandum of demands to Home Minister Rajnath Singh.

“We are not tourists, we want our homes back. 25 years in exile will soon become once upon a time if Government remains a silent spectator,” Ravinder Pandita, head of All Parties Migrants Co-ordination Committee (APMCC), said.

Another protester Vijay Tikku said, “The Government should recognise it as a genocide, an ethnic cleansing and seriously order a probe into it. They can at least order an SIT to look into the matter and provide us justice”.

“We don’t want Article 370 for Jammu and Kashmir… In fact, we want Government to identify it as a Union Territory so that the Indian Constitution is applicable to that area,” Tikku added. (AGENCIES)
