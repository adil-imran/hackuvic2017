Spike In Immigrants Illegally Crossing Into US Ahead Of Election

CBS ^ | Oct 25, 2016 | CBS

There has been a surge of immigrants illegally crossing into the United States leading up to next months presidential election.

CBS News reports dozens of immigrants have been streaming through the streets of McAllen, Texas, on a daily basis. They have been taken to a migrant center at Sacred Heart Catholic Church where they were released by Border Patrol, with ankle monitors, while they file for asylum.

Agent Chris Cabrera told CBS News that theyve been seeing a spike in immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally, thanks in part to the election.

The smugglers are telling them if Hillary [Clinton] gets elected, that therell be some sort of amnesty, that they need to get here by a certain date, Cabrera said. Theyre also being told that if [Donald] Trump gets elected, theres going to be some magical wall that pops up overnight and once that wall gets up, nobody will ever get in again.

Cabrera added that theyve encountered up to 1,000 immigrants along McAllens stretch of the border some days.

Were getting mass spikes of people crossing and turning themselves in, he said.

Experts told CBS News the number of immigrants crossing the border wont drop after Election Day.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has repeatedly said as president the U.S. will build a wall...

Trump claimed the U.S. government is speeding up the citizenship process for immigrants on the waiting list so they can vote.

Theyre letting people pour into the country so they can go and vote, Trump said...

Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has promised to propose immigration legislation in her first 100 days as president that would include a route to citizenship.

Trump has clarified that he opposes any pathway to legal status for immigrants in the U.S. illegally...

It looks like the D-Day invasion at some of the spots along the border.

Trump’s contract with the voters says “cancel visas from countries that won’t take them back.” It’s a start anyway.

This is getting out of hand, just what the hell is the point in having border guards and what the hell is the point in being a citizen anymore.

We have more foreign born immigrants in the country than ever before. It is time to kick out the ones that are here illegally, especially those who will not assimilate into our culture. We actually need around a 20 year moratorium on new immigration in any form just to get things somewhat stabilized from the mess that has been created over the last 30 years. Immigration both illegal and legal are largely responsible for the stagnation that has occurred in recent decades. It is not hard to figure out why if you look at the actual demographics especially in construction, manufacturing, service, and agricultural jobs. But even the medical and government segments have been negatively impacted.

Ankle monitors, what a joke. Criminals filing for asylum. Deport them.
