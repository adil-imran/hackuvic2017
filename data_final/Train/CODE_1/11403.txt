A Florida man who threatened an Orlando Pulse-style massacre has appeared in federal court.

Craig Jungwirth of South Florida appeared in his first court date on Friday, after posting on the internet threatening a Labor Day attack worse than the Orlando Pulse Massacre which left 49 dead and 53 injured.

He wrote: “If you losers thought the Pulse nightclub shooting was bad, wait until you see what I’m planning for Labor Day.”

Jungwirth is charged with making onine threats, and violating a federal law which bans “any communication containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of another.”

According to WESH, Jungwirth’s attorney informed federal Magistrate David Baker that he plans to file for pre-trial bond, and have him released.

But prosecutors asked the Magistrate to halt those proceedings until Thursday, at which point they can have an FBI agent to court to provide testimony.

Jungwirth was arrested last Saturday with his mother in a duplex in southwest Orlando.

Asked whether she was afraid of her son when she appeared on Thursday in court to support him, she simply said “No, no comment”.

His sister Shanna Berger also turned up to court and blew him kisses according to WESH.

Berger told WESH: “He’s musically inclined, a mechanical engineer. A very caring person.” She added, “He’s very peaceful. He’s not violent.”
