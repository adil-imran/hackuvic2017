Donald Trump pre-empted the liberal media criticism of Republicans not caring about people by visiting last week, which even preceded sitting President Barack Obama. Obama waited up to ten days to visit flood-damaged Baton Rouge, with little criticism from the media, while George W. Bush was criticized for responding to Hurricane Katrina after three days.

But, where is Hillary Clinton in all this? She tweeted support and the like for the people of Baton Rouge, but Trump visited and brought donations for the displaced residents of Baton Rouge. There were no feature articles asking this question on ABC News, CBS News, CNN or NBC News’ website.

In a Google search of “Hillary Clinton Baton Rouge”, and even “Hillary Clinton Baton Rouge floods,” the results did not say when Hillary Clinton would visit the city. But, she did call for giving donations to the victims on social media!
