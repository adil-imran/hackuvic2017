According to IHS Jane's, a website specialized in a defence and aerospace news, this will be the debut for Russia's newest military helicopter, which will provide security for the Russian air base in Syria's western province of Latakia.

Russia's Defense Ministry on Tuesday released a high-definition video showing one of its Su-24 fighter-bombers conducting a sortie over the skies of war-torn Syria.

Russian warplanes hit nearly 600 terrorist infrastructure facilities in Syria over the past 4 days, completing 157 combat flight missions, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov has said.

The ministry added that MiG-29 provided air cover to the Russian bombers that were carrying out raids against positions of ISIS terrorist organization in Syria. "Russian Su-34 bombers delivered air strikes at terrorists' strongholds in the vicinity of the settlement of Bgelia in the Dei ez-Zor province, where Islamic State militants massacred about 300 civilians to intimidate the local population", he said.

"The airstrikes also destroyed three trucks with ammunition, two SUVs with mounted Zu-23 anti-aircraft cannons", he said.

Over the weekend, Islamic State jihadists have reportedly slaughtered up to 300 people in the Deir ez-Zor province, killing "whole families" for alleged cooperation with the Syrian Army.
