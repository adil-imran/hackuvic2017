MADIKERI: THE devatiparamb monument constructed by the Codava National Council at Aiyyangeri Reserve Forest area on the way to Bhaghamandla, was smashed by miscreants.

When Manoj of Cherambane lodged a complaint, police rushed to the spot on Friday and inspected the place along with forest officials. Tight security has been deployed at the area. A case has been registered at the Bhaghamadla police station. U Nachappa, president of Codava National Council, said, “Devatiparamb is on Aiyyangeri-Bhaghamandla road where thousands of Codavas were massacred by Tipu

Sultan on December 13, 1785 as they came to meet the Mysuru king. But, Tipu cheated them and his army killed unarmed Codavas.”

Nachappa urged the government to establish a national monument on par with Jallianwala Bhagh and said he will take the matter to the UN.
