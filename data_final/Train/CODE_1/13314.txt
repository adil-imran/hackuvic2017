The Islamic Movement in Nigeria has demanded the full disclosure of the health condition of the movement’s leader Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky by Nigerian security authorities.

A statement by its spokesperson Ibrahim Musa yesterday said disclosing the health condition of their leader would douse the tension among the public and put an end to various rumours making the rounds about the scholar’s condition.

He said it was worrisome that the condition and whereabouts of Sheikh Zakzaky and his wife are still unknown, three weeks after their arrest and detention by the Nigerian military.Musa said despite the revelation on December 18 last year by the Chief of Army Staff Lt. General Tukur Buratai that Zakzaky had been transferred from the army to “appropriate authorities for prosecution,” all the relevant authorities contacted denied custody of the sheikh.“We presumed he meant the Nigerian police. However to our bewilderment, when a committee of National Supreme Council for Islamic affairs (NSCIA) met the Inspector General of police and demanded to see the Sheikh, he flatly refused.“Surprisingly while the Nigerian authorities had announced that he was detained and arraigned in Kaduna prison, the Controller of Kaduna Prisons, Abubakar Argungu, denied he was in their custody. So whom should we believe? This smacks of deceit, conspiracy and outright manipulation of the public’s view of the army’s massacre in Zaria,” he said.He said the movement and the public “are now seriously anxious,” asking questions such as “where is Sheikh Zakzaky and why has he been denied his constitutional rights to an attorney, bail and visitation?”The statement said if the government was interested in finding a peaceful way out of the crisis, “it should by now have allowed unimpeded access to Sheikh Zakzaky,” saying they were “highly agitated by this seeming needless incommunicado the Sheikh has been placed in.”“First and foremost, his first family members and leading brothers of the Islamic Movement should have met him in the company of his doctor by now, since he was shot by the soldiers when they attacked his residence.”
