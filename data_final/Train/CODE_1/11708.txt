Presidential candidate Donald Trump, no stranger to controversy, found himself in hot water once again Saturday after he tweeted a heartless message regarding the death of Dwyane Wade's cousin.

Wade's relative, Nykea Aldridge, was pushing a stroller in Chicago Friday afternoon when two men exchanged gunfire nearby, hitting her in the arm and the head. The mother of four was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Two people have been questioned in connection with the shooting.

Trump sent out a tweet Saturday morning using the incident to call for the support of African-Americans.

As expected, Trump's message was ripped across social media.

Trump's camp sent out another, more appropriate tweet Saturday afternoon.

It's unknown if someone on Trump's staff suggested the more appropriate tweet, but a staffer apparently did try to clean up his first tweet, if only cosmetically. After Trump's original tweet misspelled Wade's first name "Dwayne," that tweet was deleted in favor of the one with the correct spelling. The two tweets were sent from different devices.

This is not the first time the controversial candidate has tweeted a self-serving message in the wake of tragedy. After the Orlando nightclub massacre in June, Trump tweeted, "Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!"
