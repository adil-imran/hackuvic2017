Will fin breid, barley-bree an paintit room. Whan MacLean meets wi's friens in Springburn. Aa thae roses an geeans will turn tae blume. An a black laud frae yont Nyanga. Dings the fell gallows o the burghers doun.

Black an white ane-til-ither mairriet. Mak the vile barracks o thair maisters bare. Sae come aa ye at hame wi freedom. Never heed whit the houdies croak for Doom. In yer hous aa the bairns o Aidam.

Murn the ships sailin doun the Broomielaw. Broken faimilies in launs we've hairriet. Will curse 'Scotlan the Brave' nae mair, nae mair.

Roch the win i the clear day's dawin. Blaws the clouds heilster-gowdie owre the bay. But thair's mair nor a roch win blawin. Thro the Great Glen o the warl the day. It's a thocht that wad gar our rottans. Aa thae rogues that gang gallus fresh an gay.

TECH giant Virgin Media is to connect 360,000 Scottish homes and businesses to its fibre optic network by the end of 2019, it has been announced.

Work has already begun in Falkirk and Ayrshire as part of the company's £3 billion Project Lightning expansion across the UK.

Around 70,000 premises in Dunfermline, Dalgety Bay, Rosyth and Inverkeithing will be connected as engineers move into Fife. Meanwhile, another 55,000 will join the network in Kilmarnock, Ayr, Prestwick and Irvine.

The company offers the fastest widely-available broadband speeds in the UK, reaching up to 200 megabits per second for homes and 300Mbps for business.

Martin McFadyen, Virgin Media's regional director for Scotland, said: "Our ambition is to give more people in Scotland the broadband boost they deserve. We urge local councils and landlords to work with us to ensure this expansion happens as quickly as possible."

Connectivity minister Fergus Ewing said: "We have made the commitment to ensure that 100 per cent of premises across Scotland will have access to superfast broadband by 2021.

"Commercial investment will play a huge part in delivering that commitment and I am delighted to welcome the substantial investment that Virgin Media are making in Scotland."
