Some 52 universities and colleges will hold a memorial service for victims of the Garissa University College massacre, in which 147 people, mostly students, were killed by al Shabaab on April 2 last year.

Heavily armed terrorists stormed the university at dawn in the country’s single deadliest attack on civilians.

The country is still coming to terms with the September 21, 2013, Westgate Mall massacre where 67 people were killed in Nairobi.

Universities and Colleges Students Peace Association of Kenya says the students’ deaths is among the worst attack in Kenya’s history.

The Garissa University College was reopened in January, nine months after the attack that left 79 injured.

Chairman Allan Chacha yesterday said UCSPAK has invited President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto, Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet, Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery and US and UK envoys for the memorial.

It will be held on April 2 at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre in Nairobi.

Some 3,000 youth from universities and colleges, religious leaders from all faiths and national leaders have been invited.

“We are expected to attend the event to pray and reflect on why we need security and sustainable peace,” Chacha said.

The University of Nairobi, Moi University, Kenyatta, Mount Kenya, Garissa and Tangaza universities will be represented.

The event will include lighting of 147 candles for all those killed.

Chacha said Uhuru will light one candle to symbolise peace.

“We do not want to see this happen again in our history. It was a big blow to the education sector and we vowed to stand together to fight terror,” he said.

The peace group has already started educating students to stop radicalisation in schools.
