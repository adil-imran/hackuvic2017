The death toll from raids of the Saudi-US aggression on Yemen on the Zaidi Directorate Security Administration in Hodeidah Governorate rose to 46 martyrs and 38 wounded.

Al-Massira website suggests that the toll would rise as search and rescue operations are still ongoing.

The site reported that most of the martyrs are prisoners of the Zaidi directorate, pointing out that nearly 130 prisoners were in the jail during the raids.

Earlier at dawn on Sunday, the initial toll of martyrs was more than 46 people, and 20 people at least.

The Health Bureau in Hodeidah province launched a distress call to donate blood for the wounded, pointing out that 15 injured were transferred to the military hospital, 3 were taken to the May 22 hospital and one is treated in the Revolution Hospital.

The Hodeidah massacre comes in light of the lies driven by the Saudi-led aggression media against the Yemeni military and the Popular Committees Forces to cover up its crimes against the Yemeni people.
