The book by Hovsep Hayreni, and entitled Upper Euphrates Armenians, 1915 and Dersim, has been published in Turkey, according to Akunq.net..

Most of the sources used in this book comprise the Armenian recollections of the eyewitnesses, and the majority of recollections are made public in Turkish for the first time.

In addition, the author of this book presents how and by whom the Armenian massacres and the genocide were carried out in the aforesaid area, and which local ethnic clans had protected the Armenians.

Noting that, as a result of the Armenian Genocide, both the Armenian and the Kurdish people have lost the chance to be survive together, Hovsep Hayreni considers the Dersim—i.e. today’s Tunceli Province of Turkey—massacre in 1938 to be a continuation of the Armenian Genocide in 1915.

The Dersim massacre was an extermination of the local Kurdish population by the Turkish government.
