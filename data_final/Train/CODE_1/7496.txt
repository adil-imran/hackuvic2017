ISLAMABAD: US president Barack Obama on Wednesday telephoned Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and expressed his deep grief on behalf of the American nation over the tragic Lahore suicide bombing.

Sources told Geo News that President Obama said the officials and people of United States stand with Pakistan and its people at this hour of sorrow. He lauded PM Nawaz Sharif’s decision to put off the US trip and stay with people of Pakistan at this difficult time.

Obama hoped to see Nawaz Sharif soon, saying he is looking forward to meeting him.

He said the Pakistani nation will eventually emerge triumphant in the ongoing war against the scourge of terrorism.

“Pakistan achieved major successes in the counter-terrorism campaign in your (Nawz Sharif’s) lead,” Obama said, assuring continuation of an all-out cooperation to Pakistan for rooting out terrorism from the country.

PM Sharif said his and his people’s resolve is only gaining strength with time. He said the invisible enemy, after getting his infrastructure destroyed, was now targeting innocent people.

The attack on Sunday evening in the busy Gulshan-i-Iqbal park killed 72 people, mostly women and children enjoying an Easter weekend outing. Pakistan, a majority-Muslim country, has a Christian population of more than 2 million.

Sunday’s terrorist attack was the deadliest incident since the December 2014 massacre of 134 school children at Army Public School in Peshawar that prompted a military-led crackdown on militancy and terrorism.
