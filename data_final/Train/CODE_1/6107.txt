(IraqiNews.com) Dhi Qar â€“ Iraqi authorities on Sunday hanged 36 men convicted for the 2014 Camp Speicher massacre, in which 1,700 military recruits were killed in Tikrit.

The execution was carried out at Nasiriyah prison in Dhi Qar province and was attended by the Minister of Justice and other representatives of the local government, apart from the family members of the victims.

It may be mentioned here that Iraqi President Fuad Masum on August 14 ratified all the death sentences received from the judiciary in connection to the Camp Speicher massacre. Three accused, however, were released from all the charges due to the lack of evidence against them.
