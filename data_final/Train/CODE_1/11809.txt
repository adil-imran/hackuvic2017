A woman is dead and a man unaccounted for after the pair went kayaking in an icy southern Ontario river.

Police were called after two empty kayaks were seen lodged in ice in the Credit River near Terra Cotta, about 65 kilometres northwest of Toronto, on Sunday afternoon, Ontario Provincial Police said.

Investigators rushed to the scene and found a woman’s lifeless body “some time later,” OPP said. Her identity has not been released pending contact of her family. OPP have yet to release details on the missing man or his relationship to the deceased woman, but said that both are in their early 20s.

A large scale search effort was quickly launched for a missing male kayaker on Sunday. The efforts include a K-9 team, patrol officers and OPP Aviation Services.

The search was called off Sunday night, when it became too dark to continue. Dive crews returned to the river on Monday morning to look for signs of the missing man, and break up a patch of ice where the kayaks were found.
