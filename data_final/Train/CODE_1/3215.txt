One Conspiracy Theory Trump Needs to Push

American Thinker ^ | August 15, 2016 | Jack Cashill

Posted on by Kaslin

Playing a coveted role in the most one-sided assault in the history of political journalism, NBC News ran an article last week that managed -- in the headline -- to insult both the candidate and his base, Trump's Conspiracy Theories Aren't Far Outside GOP Mainstream".

Today, if a politically troublesome issue arises, the media feel no pressure to investigate. Confident their peers will slack off as well, they tend to dismiss the issue as a conspiracy theory and deride those who raise it as gullible, paranoid, and probably racist.

Donald Trump has raised any number of such issues, and the media have reflexively attacked him for raising them. His focus has been on Barack Obamas quasi-fictional past. A more profitable focus, however, would be on Hillary Clintons future fitness to be president. I refer specifically here to her role in the corruption of the TWA 800 investigation.

When my book, TWA 800: The Crash, the Cover-Up, The Conspiracy, was published last month, I hoped the twentieth anniversary of the disaster might prompt at least some media interest. I was kidding myself. The collective urge to stop Trump and elect Hillary has silenced the major media. Trump will have to ask his own questions.

From her logs, we know that Hillary and President Bill Clinton returned to the White House at 8:35 p.m. on the night of July 17, 1996. Former Chief of Staff Leon Panetta tells us he called the president at 9 p.m. with the news that TWA Flight 800 blew up off the coast of Long Island.

No.

Distractions. x2 Message - message - message - message - pick carefully thought out shots. That is the winning formula - not quipping about everything. The more Trump allows himself to be distracted away from his message the worst the media coverage gets. I know we cheer (myself included) when he slaps them down, but he can win every battle and lose the war. He has to get his message out.

And pretty darn soon.

I believe something nefarious happened to TWA flight 800, and that there was a coverup. That said, Trump should not touch this with a ten-foot pole during the campaign. There are meatier targets to attack.

Exactly. Mr. Trump shouldn’t shoulder any more burden than what it takes to clip Hillary’s little ugly demon bat wings. Everything else in its own time.



To: Kaslin

I don’t see how bringing up TWA flight 800 could possibly help us win.

“I dont see how bringing up TWA flight 800 could possibly help us win.” It would not help Trump win, but it would help Jack Cashill sell books.
