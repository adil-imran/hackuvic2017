Durban – Five people were killed in a brutal family massacre in the KwaCeza area near Vryheid on Saturday night.

A 3-year-old toddler was hacked to death with a bush knife, a man was shot execution style and two other adults and a 5-year-old child were burnt to death when the family home was torched.

Police spokesperson Major Shooz Magudulela said the homestead was thought to have been attacked under the cover of darkness by five suspects.

“It is alleged that a 33-year-old victim was shot in the head and died instantly. The other three victims aged 5, 58 and 60 were set alight inside the rondavel and killed. A 3-year-old was chopped to death with a bush knife,” he said.

Magudulela said a 15-year-old boy was also attacked by the group, who were wielding pangas, but had survived.

“He was taken to hospital for treatment. The motive for the killing is still under investigation. Five counts of murder and attempted murder have been opened at Ceza Police Station. A task team has been established to investigate this brutal attack on innocent people," he said.

Magudulela added that a police task team was formed and officers were quick to arrest five people.

“The arrested suspects, aged between 25 and 33-years-old, will appear in the Mahlabathini Magistrate's Court soon,” he said.
