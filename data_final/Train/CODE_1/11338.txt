Iran: Arab League's One-Sided Support Has Made Saudi Regime More Brazen

Tasnim Saturday 10th September, 2016

TEHRAN (Tasnim) - Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi slammed the Arab League for its blind support for massacre of civilians in the region at the hands of the Saudi regime, saying that such backing has further emboldened Riyadh.

In a statement on Friday, Qassemi described a statement issued at the end of a meeting of the Arab League's Council of Foreign Ministers in Cairo on Thursday as 'one-sided'.

"If this council is honest in its willingness to help promote peaceful coexistence among regional countries and is firmly determined to establish convergence and boost good neighborliness, it is necessary to stop its unconstructive support for Riyadh just for once," the spokesman noted.

He also emphasized that 'biased' support of the Arab League leaders and its foreign ministerial council for some members of the body in recent years not only has not helped settle crises and misunderstandings among regional countries and the league's members but also caused more instability, insecurity and chaos across the region.

Such supports have made Saudi Arabia 'more brazen and shameless' in killing innocent people in some Arab countries in the region, Qassemi added.

He said that the council should firmly urge Riyadh to stop killing and cracking down on people in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Bahrain as well as supporting terrorists in the region.

Qassemi made the remarks in response to the Arab foreign ministers' condemnation of the recent statements by Iran against Saudi Arabia.
