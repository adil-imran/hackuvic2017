YEREVAN, FEBRUARY 25, ARMENPRESS. A rally will be organized in the Hague city of the Netherlands on February 26 ahead of the remembrance day of the Sumgait massacres perpetrated by the Azerbaijani government. President of the “Federation of Armenian Organizations” in the Netherlands and the “Abovyan Cultural Association” Mato Hakhverdyan told “Armenpress” about this. In his words, a note of protest will be submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands.

“Our demand is the following: The international community must give an adequate assessment to the Armenian massacres in Sumgait. Besides, pay much attention to Karabakh conflict. We see what the Syrian conflict has developed into, the situation is tense both in Syria and Turkey. The conflict has taken such a complex form that it can pose danger to the region. Shooting takes place on the borders of Armenia and Artsakh, soldiers are killed. It can escalate instantly. Such issues must be taken seriously. Our demand from the Netherlands is that they should take the issue seriously”, Mato Hakhverdyan said.

He noted that the Azerbaijanis had organized an exhibition on Khojaly incidents in the Netherlands recently, presenting distorted facts.

The rally in Hague is organized by the mutual efforts of the “Federation of Armenian Organizations” in the Netherlands and Hay Dat" commission.

From 1988 to 1990, the Armenian population in Soviet Azerbaijan was the target of racially motivated pogroms against Armenians in the cities of Sumgait (February 27-29, 1988), Kirovabad (November 21-27, 1988) and Baku (January 13-19, 1990). Hundreds of Armenians became the victim of the silence of the USSR’s silence.
