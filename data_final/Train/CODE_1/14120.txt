Amnesty International has named South Sudan among the countries that have no accountability for crimes under international law.

Discrimination against women, genocide, ethnic cleansing are some of the crimes under international law

It says security forces and armed groups have committed crimes without any accountability.

In a report, the rights group says impunity by governments and those in power remained a key driver of conflicts and instability over the past year.

“There was little or no accountability for crimes under international law committed by security forces and armed groups in countries as disparate as Cameroon, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan,” the report noted.

It says there is need for the AU hybrid court to try war crime suspects in South Sudan.

The Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mawien Makol, says the court will help in bringing suspects to justice.

“As soon as the government of national unity is formed, the court will be formed to bring to justice those who were accused of committing crimes in the crisis,” Mr Makol.

Other countries that have been named for lack accountability include Cameroon, Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
