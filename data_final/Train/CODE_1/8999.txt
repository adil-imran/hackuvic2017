Lord Sacks decries 'ethnic cleansing' of Christians in Middle East

March 30, 2016

The former chief rabbi of the British Commonwealth has protested the "ethnic cleansing" of Christians in the Middle East and called for an international response.

"The ethnic cleansing of Christians throughout the Middle East is one of the crimes against humanity of our time, and I am appalled that there has been little serious international protest," wrote Lord Jonathan Sacks in an op-ed column for the Daily Telegraph.

Lord Sacks argued that while Christians have been the main targets of recent Islamic terrorism, their ultimate target is freedom in the West. He wrote: "The calculation of terrorists is that, in the long run, the West will prove too tired to defend its own freedoms."

Lord Sacks, who was Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the British Commonwelath from 1991 to 2013, was recently named the 2016 winner of the Templeton Prize, in recognition of his work against religious extremism.
