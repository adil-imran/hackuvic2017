CEBU, Philippines - In 2001, the worst terrorist attack in U.S. history occurred as four large passenger jets were hijacked then crashed, killing nearly 3,000 persons. Four separate teams of Middle Eastern terrorists, operating from inside the U.S., boarded the morning flights posing as passengers and later had forcibly commandeered the aircraft. Two fully-fueled jumbo jets, American Airlines Flight 11 carrying 92 people and United Airlines Flight 175 carrying 65 people, had departed Boston for Los Angeles. Both jets were diverted by the hijackers to New York City, where they were piloted into the twin towers of the World Trade Center. The impact and subsequent fire caused both 110-story towers to collapse, killing 2,752 persons including hundreds of rescue workers and people employed in the towers. In addition, United Airlines Flight 93, which had departed Newark for San Francisco, and American Airlines Flight 77, which had departed Dulles (Virginia) for Los Angeles, were hijacked. Flight 77 with 64 people on board was diverted to Washington, D.C., then piloted into the Pentagon building, killing everyone on board and 125 military personnel inside the building. Flight 93 with 44 people on board was also diverted toward Washington but crashed into a field in Pennsylvania after passengers attempted to overpower the terrorists on board.

In the Philippines

• In 1917, Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos, the 10th president of the Philippines and the longest to stay in office for more than 20 years, was born in Sarrat, Ilocos Norte. A champion debater of the University of the Philippines, Marcos topped the Bar examinations with an almost perfect score. Before his election to the presidency in November 1965, Marcos was a member of the House of Representatives and of the Senate. He was Senate president from 1963 to 1965. Dubbed as the country’s “strongman,” President Marcos’ greatest achievement was in the fields of infrastructure, development and international diplomacy. During his first term as president he managed to attain a robust economy, secured increased economic and financial assistance from the United States, shortened the military bases agreement from 99 years to 25 years, and hosted a seven-nation summit conference on the crisis in South Vietnam. Following his reelection for a second term in November 1969, he declared martial law in September 1972, abolished both houses of Congress, promulgated a new Constitution and created the Batasang Pambansa in 1981. Marcos was again reelected as president under the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan party in 1981. On February 7, 1986, he ran in a snap election against the presidential candidate of the united opposition, Mrs. Corazon C. Aquino, widow of assassinated former Senator Benigno S. Aquino Jr. Marcos was again declared winner by the then unicameral legislature and the Commission on Elections. However, a peaceful people power revolution from February 22 to 25, 1986 forced Marcos and his family to flee to Hawaii, paving the way for Mrs. Aquino to be proclaimed as the country’s 11th president. Marcos died at the age of 72 on September 28, 1989 of kidney, heart and lung ailments in Waikiki, Hawaii. His remains are currently interred inside a refrigerated crypt in his Ilocos Norte home province. — www.kahimyang.com
