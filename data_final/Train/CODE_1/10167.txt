Al-Sharq newspaper commented its editorial under the title "The massacre of Deir Al-Asafeer" in Syria, saying that this massacre reaffirms that Al-Assad has no intention in a political solution, as he continues to bomb civilians by fighter jets and artillery and violates the truce backed by the international community, as well as his lack of seriousness needed in the talks process in Geneva, and his delegation was procrastinating and refusing to engage into the major topic of a political transition and form a transitional governing body with full powers in which Al-Assad and his aides have no place.--SPA11:18 LOCAL TIME 08:18 GMT
