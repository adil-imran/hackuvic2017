Azerbaijan commemorates massacre



On Feb. 25-26 each year, Azerbaijani commemorates the innocent people killed in the 1992 Armenian invasion.

Marking the 24th anniversary of the "Khojaly genocide" this year, the Azerbaijan Embassy in Seoul again wants to raise awareness of the tragic incident. In 1988, Armenian armed forces with the help of Infantry Guards Regiment 366 of the former

USSR seized Khojaly, a town in the Republic of Azerbaijan's Nagorny Karabakh

region in a bid to annex the region.



Out of Khojaly's population of 2,500 people, 613 civilians were killed, 1,000 were wounded and/or 1,275 taken hostage. A total of 150 people are still missing.



Leyla Aliyeva, vice-president of the Heydar Aliyev Foundation set up in 2008, started the "International Awareness Campaign" under the motto "Justice for Khojaly-Freedom for Karabakh."



The campaign aims to raise international awareness through photographs of the victims and their suffering in the Karabakh conflict and Khojaly massacre in particular.
