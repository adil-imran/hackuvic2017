Mourners have left dozens of bouquets of flowers at the gates of Dunblane Primary School to mark the 20th anniversary of the massacre which saw 16 children murdered.

A special church service has been held to remember those who died and people have visited the school throughout the day to pay their respects.

The pathologist who identified the bodies of the children has spoken of the harrowing experience on the 20th anniversary of the tragedy.

Hundreds of bouquets of flowers were today left at the gravesides of the 16 schoolchildren and their teacher who died in the Dunblane shootings on March 13, 1996

Anthony Busuttil was called in to examine the scene after Thomas Hamilton shot dead 16 young children and their teacher before turning the gun on himself on March 13, 1996.

Mr Busuttil described walking into the gym at Dunblane Primary School as the 'hardest thing' he ever had to do, and chillingly said that killer Hamilton's 'black-clad body' had 'looked like Mussolini from a distance, with a black shirt and combat Â­trousers'.

'I hit my wall when I entered the gym at Dunblane,' Professor Busuttil told the Sunday Mirror. 'It was the hardest thing I ever had to do to keep my legs moving forward.

'You could not go into that gym, you could not work with the bodies of five-year-olds at the hospital and not be incredibly moved.'

Disgraced former Scout leader Hamilton was 43 when he carried out the planned execution of innocents, first cutting the school's telephone wires before making his way to the gym hall armed with four legally-held handguns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.

Inside the gym, 28 primary one pupils were preparing for PE class as he entered and began shooting, killing 16 children and their teacher Gwen Mayor and injuring 15 others.

The massacre, which happened shortly after 9.30am in the Stirlingshire town, shocked the nation and led to the UK enforcing some of the strictest firearms legislation in the world.

Hamilton became a Scout leader in 1973, at the age of 20, but was asked to leave the following year because of complaints about his behaviour at camp.

In a BBC documentary to mark the anniversary, former head teacher Ron Taylor, 63, described how he is still consumed with guilt by the tragedy.

'It was unimaginably horrible to see children dying in front of you. I felt enormous guilt - more than a survivor's guilt. It was my school, I felt violated,' he said.

'As a headteacher what happened to me that day was the worst experience any headteacher could have. People have to cope in their own way.

'One of the things I have at home is a box full of newspaper articles.

'And it includes my own written version of the events of the day and I did that to help. I locked it away and thankfully I have never looked at it again.'

Police Scotland released a statement ahead of the anniversary of the tragedy.

Stirling Local Area Commander, Chief Inspector Paul Rollo, said: 'This terrible incident cast a shadow on the town and on Sunday we will join together in remembrance and to celebrate the vibrant community which has overcome such tragedy.
