Iran’s Defense Minister Hussein Dehqan condemned on Sunday the Saudi massacre in Yemen saying Saudi rulers are “war criminals and should be put on trial.”

“They have committed an unpardonable crime which should not go unnoticed by the world,” Dehqan said. “Whoever keeps silent against the barbarity will have assisted the Al Saud with the crime.”

More than 150 people were killed and over 500 wounded when airstrikes hit a funeral ceremony in Yemen’s capital, Sana’a on October 8. In the aftermath of the strike on Saturday, hundreds of body parts were found strewn in and outside the hall.

Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi also said on Saturday that the international community is still keeping silent on Saudi military aggression and the killing of Yemenis for one and a half year.

“In order to put an end to the fabricated crisis in Yemen, there is no way but to stop the belligerent nature of the brutal Al Saud aggressors and begin serious dialogue with the participation of all Yemeni sides,” the spokesperson pointed out.

He expressed Iran’s disgust over such an inhumane and heinous crime and sympathized with the families of the victims.
