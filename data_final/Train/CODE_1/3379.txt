Update 3 on Twin Falls, Idaho "Rapefugee" case: Victim and family terrified in aftermath

WND ^ | 6/28/2016 | Leo Hohmann

Posted on by Javeth

The 5-year-old Idaho girl who was sexually assaulted by migrant boys from Sudan and Iraq has become a prisoner in her own house since the crime was committed more than three weeks ago, says a close friend of the family.

Thats because one of the boys families who was evicted from the apartment complex had still not moved out as of Monday evening.

The families of the three boys involved  two from Sudan ages 10 and 14 and a third from Iraq age 7  were all evicted from the Fawnbrook Apartments in Twin Falls last week following publicity about the sexual assault, which occurred June 2 in a laundry room at the complex. The Sudanese families immediately left the complex but the Iraqi family still had not as of Monday.

Twin Falls Mayor Shawn Barigar made a statement at the start of Monday nights city council meeting calling for calm in the community and asking residents to focus on facts and not emotion because thats not who we are.

Julie Ruf, a resident of Twin Falls and friend of the family of the little girl who was assaulted, told WND the mayors statement sounded like it could have been written by someone in the Obama administration.

Reading about the way this girl and her family has been treated (and the way the MSM has either ignored this or try to distort it by obsessing on debunking trivial details) is infuriating. Even more so given that the Idaho US Attorney recently even tried to muzzle the free speech of locals raising objections and criticisms about the whole process. These globalist cultural Marxists whine about meanie locals who might "make the refugees uncomfortable", even though a big proportion of the refugees are criminal Muslims as Ann Corcoran has been documenting at Refugee resettlement watch. But then these traitors to the American republic have no qualms about the way the terrorized victim and her family are being humiliated and denied their own basic protections. Has the family been given the benefit of a restraining order against the perpetrators and those around them threatening the family? Has there been any protection for the witnesses of the crime, or the community speaking up for their rights? No, of course not. The reason is obvious, Obama's program is a deliberate effort to dump millions of refugees (brought in "legallY" so this is even before we get to all the illegal aliens being brought in), including a major number of criminal Muslims, into quiet and formerly peaceful small-town communities in Red States. All to import armies of new Democratic voters to vote for the freebies that we're forced to pay for with our hard-earned tax dollars. This then makes it harder for us to support our own families, coupled with all the illegals and the outsourcing of jobs and H1b visa which push out our jobs and our incomes down even further. Which gives the "authorities" an excuse to import even more refugees into the USA to "do the work Americans won't do" (even though most of them are on years of welfare). And then when a disproportionate number of those refugees turn out to be dangerous criminals who terrorize and traumatize their communities, the Obama Administration then sends in petty tyrants to quell free speech and dissent when the people dare to stand up for themselves or cite the Constitution. Which then gives the Obama Administration even more excuse in their policies to "punish those small-town yokels" to dump in even more refugees, fast track them to be registered as Democratic voters-- until the demographics change so much that we're permanently outvoted, and they come to take our guns too in case we get too "vocal" about our rights. It's an evil, sinister plan to permanently change the very identity and makeup of the United States to make sure the globalists have a constantly growing base of low-info, easily plied voters to keep the Democrats in office. But the worst part about is that our own GOPe RINO's like Paul Ryan, John McCain, Jeff Flake, Kelly Ayotte, Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio, Bob Corker, Bob Hoeven, Lamar Alexander, Susana Martinez, Nikki Haley, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Roger Wicker, Bill Kristol, Robert Kagan, Max Boot and other neocons not only say nothing in response to this evil attack on our very republic, but actively assist it themselves. All because they've taken the bribes from the cheap labor lobby of the Chambers of Commerce, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Sheldon Adelson, Goldman-Sachs and the other corrupt plutocrats who keep p#ssing on the conservative movement and the US Constitution. All of these RINO traitors need to be Cantorized in the primaries. And the good people of Twin Falls deserve our support. Thanks' as always to Leo Hohmann for his top notch reporting.

This is exactly what Obama wants. He HATES white people who don’t bow down before him. He relishes the power the refugee has over white natives. If a million whites have to die for his colored revolution so be it. Obama doesn’t care. Obama supports a white genocide. Obama uses his power to ensure a white genocide.



To: Javeth

This is infuriating. Are there no real men in the area? Is the family “trash”, and no one wants to help them? I wish this happened in my town, which is an awful thing to say.

Your post was spot-on. “Obama supports a white genocide.” He supports it, but he’s not going to get it. If Hillary! is elected, the drumbeat continues.... Vote accordingly is all I can say.

I am tired of the “it’s not who we are” crapola. It’s not who YOU are pal...not me. I am an islam hater. I despise it and everything and everyone associated with it. I want it and it’s adherents (soldiers) expurgated from MY country

To: Paulie

A very relevant question! The scary thing is several of my old friends and neighbors think the answer is already no, certainly not anymore. And with Obama continuing to import millions of Democrat-voting heavily-Muslim refugees and “multi-country” immigrants on the Charles Schumer visa program, and Hillary looking to push that number up even further if her band of crooks ushers her in office, the demographics are already putting the ballot box out of reach. All the while our tax dollars are used to pay for our own suffering at the hands of these scum— it was Idaho taxpayers fund that ware used to put up those “refugees” in the cushy juvenile detention facility there in the Magic Valley. And even worse, that’s just the obvious taxes, then there’s also the massive state, city and federal debt that’s hidden only in sense that it will translate into massively higher taxes when the bill comes due. Plus all those rising crazy premiums for Obamacare, Justice Roberts himself declared that Obamacare is a tax, and funny enough those premiums keep going up even though our medical care quality goes down, access goes down and our deductibles go up. Looking at cases like these savage refugees in Idaho and Minnesota and you can see why— the Obamacare premiums are just another kind of tax, thinly-disguised, that transfers our hard-earned funds to the millions of people Obama is using to displace us with and ensure permanent power for him and his flunkies. Just like Venezuela and it’s one-party rule, but even worse in our case since the RINO GOPe “opposition” that’s supposed to be standing up to this is fully complicit itself.

What you said. He hates us.



To: Democrats hate too much

Yeah, good catch, Paul Ryan is the “model Republican” for the globalist camp— perfectly happy to sell himself out and sell his constituents and the American people down the river for the bribes the cheap labor lobby keep on sending his way. What a traitor, I hope Nehlen is skewering him for this, Ryan’s own spoken idiocy is ripe for dozens of campaign attack ads.

“is a political solution even possible anymore?” No Hence all the fed agencies with all those weapons and ammo. Right down to the black man still employed as a fed-who admitted to buying billions of bullets to supply the killing of White folk.

“A DHS official whose very role at the agency is to procure guns and ammunition, of which the organization has purchased a large number of weapons and billions of rounds, has been openly calling on his black supremacist website for the great race war and the death of white Americans. Even the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLW) has acknowledge DHS employee Ayo Kimathi and his website as anti-white, which sports the name War is on the Horizon and has been taken down following press coverage. And this is the man who, on record according to the reports, as the man who works primarily on the purchase of guns and ammunition for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Ammunition and weapons that he believes will be used for the coming race war.” storyleak.com

"asking residents to focus on facts and not emotion because thats not who we are." I really hate this meaningless platitude.



To: Secret Agent Man

Not to mention the fact these criminal “refugees’ will also be recipients of affirmative action when they grow up, being put first in line before born and raised Americans for jobs, school admissions, scholarships and just about everyone else. Wow, what a deal. So these refugees can be shipped into the USA, receive tons of free goodies and benefits at the expense of hard-working American taxpayers, commit rape and other crimes against American citizens, spend a short period in a cushy juvenile detention center, get off with a slap on the wrist, and then on top of that get all kinds of affirmative action goodies in place of the very Americans who were slaving away to support them with their tax dollars while going into debt from all their health-care costs (including the rising tax of the Obamacare premiums) and school costs since they’re not eligible for scholarships themselves. Oh, and then those refugees get to sponsor dozens of other refugees and their extended family to come in and get even more freebies from the already exhausted taxpayers, plus affirmative action soon enough themselves. Drives me to rage just thinking about it.

“not emotion because thats not who we are.” Why AREN’T those people emotional about a little 5 year old girl being sexually assaulted? Especially a developmentally disabled one? Would it be THE SAME had she been black? Is this BECAUSE she’s White?

Rotherham, indeed, and the sad thing is a number of other towns in England have had their own “Rotherhams” going (with some hushed-up examples going all the way back to Enoch Powell’s warning, before even the EU for that matter) yet the authorities do nothing. All that “post-colonial British guilt” lending them to import millions from the former British colonies in Pakistan and Africa, which the authorities in Britain then go on to cite to excuse police looking the other way (or actively helping the criminals) as thousands of little English girls are handed over to the human trafficking rings of their “pure-hearted” former colonial subjects. Now the USA, Canada and Australia are seeing the same thing, and taking a cue from their counterparts across the pond. I guess it wasn’t enough to have a horror like Rotherham in one country, now it’s North America’s turn. From the way authorities have reacted in Twin Falls, doesn’t seem like they care either.

We can see the same thing happening in Europe when we see those long lines of mostly male “rapefugees” coming into Europe to outvote the European people and to intimidate them into submission. This is what all the talk of globalism is all about. Yes, Virginia there really is a globalist plot to have a one world dictatorship and it is taking shape before our eyes. This is why they always ridiculed these allegations as “conspiracy theories” keeping us in the dark as they planned a future for us without a voice for us.



To: Javeth

I still have friends in the area. They are...not pleased. The control on the media is incredibly tight and the federal attorney in Boise is flexing her muscles. This could get very nasty very quickly.



To: Javeth

You are spot on. This crap must stop, NOW. I wish people would wake up. Unfortunately, the media is a BIG problem in this & I don’t know how we can overcome the treasonous, complicit media. We are in so much trouble.

Yeah, it’s gotten so bad that even Sweden and Finland’s idiot governments finally got forced to mass-deport the Muslims. They weren’t going to do so on their own, but the public rage got so intense that the Swede nationalist party started utterly crushing the globalist “centrist” parties in the elections, and the countries (plus Norway) were finally forced to expel hundreds of thousands of their beloved Muslim “refugees”. Same thing with Merkel, she and her party got utterly crushed by the Afd party in the winter elections and were forced to expel hundreds of thousands of Muslims before the nationalists basically marched on Berlin and hung her from the rafters. France and the Belgians have been closing thousands of mosques because of the pressure from NF, Netherlands is doing it’s own mass deporting due to Geert Wilders. Hungary (Viktor Orban), Austria, the Greeks (golden-dawn), Slovakia, Italy, Denmark, Spain— same pattern. Even if the parties may be left-ish on some economic issues, the nationalists are breathing down the globalists necks and forcing tough policies on migration. Come to think of it I feel like this is the missing link in the USA, that we don’t have those openly nationalist parties to force both of the major parties to listen to the people. Immigration and national identity are the top issues for Americans and the vast majority of Americans, even most liberals and Democrats I know, don’t want this mass refugee influx and want even legal immigration sharply curbed as the country’s overrun. Yet the globalists and cheap-labor crooks who control the Democrats and RINO GOPe don’t want this, they still want open borders even with all the evidence of the damage it’s causing. And it seems like without a strong nationalist party to discipline them, the open-borders crony capitalists are able to push the agenda. I’m not much for political sci so don’t really understand this. Is there something about the American political system (and maybe the Canadian and Aussie ones too) that prevents us from having the nationalist parties that the Europeans have? Without that, it’s hard to translate popular sentiment into policy, or to keep the globalists in the “centrist” parties in line.



To: dvan

Good idea!



To: Javeth

Yeah. Still, citizens do nothing. Americans are just going to roll over and take whatever come their way. All they will ever do is blog angrily.



To: cradle of freedom

They are. They will never realize that they have been used. Even as the knife is being drawn across their throat or the noose tightened around their necks, they still won’t understand that they were used. Their last conscious thought will be,”This is all Bush’s fault.



To: Javeth

We are being framed as a “proposition nation” and not one of a particular ethnicity but ethnicity is culture and our particular culture is what made America what it is. Just look at the culture of the “refugees”, it is way too far from our concepts of what is normal and acceptable. No more conducting social experiments on American citizens. We are not guinea pigs.

A few years back a small MO town had a problem like this with a white thug. He managed to beat the rap in a criminal case where he was guilty. Shortly thereafter he was gunned down in the center of town by a group of concerned citizens, none of whom was ever identified, even in the ensuing FBI investigation. His family tried to file a civil rights lawsuit and their home mysteriously burned.

And what’s also bizarre is that Nigel Farage of the British UKIP, despite railing against the Poles and other Europeans in Britain, suddenly goes soft when the topic of the Rotherham “immigrants” comes up. It’s like even he can’t make the simple argument that Britain’s colonial past isn’t supposed to condemn it’s future generations to living under radical Islamic Shariah law. (London now has a Muslim mayor who’s taking down “racy” advertisements and forcing women to “cover up”— soon they’ll all be in burqas.) So now we have the bizarre situation where the NF in France has no qualms about calling out the Muslim enemy, forcing mosques all over to close and expelling millions of Muslims (many be self-deport), whereas even Farage won’t call out the real enemy by name. It’s scary because there’s something about the US political set-up that seems to be getting in the way of even a modest counter-balancing nationalist voice from taking hold. That’s the only way to validate people’s anger and shout down the globalists in both major parties, especially the RINO GOPe turncoats who claim to be “conservative” yet cozy up to the same PC cultural Marxist cheap labor lobby as the Democrats flooding our towns and cities with these criminals.



To: Democrats hate too much

When politicians say “that’s not who we are”, it is exactly who we are, or should be.



To: cradle of freedom

That’s the heart-of-the problem, a proposition nation only works when there’s broad agreement, and bringing in millions of radical Muslims whose culture sees the non-Muslim world to be converted (on top of millions of illegals) leads to a situation where there’s no such proposition in place..

That seems to be the sentiment among the citizens there in Idaho, would work great as a Twitter theme (or on protest boards).

I wouldn’t be a prisoner in my own apartment because of them. Lead filled bats. Every time I walked by them we’d all be tapping them on the ground. Dare them to even look at me after what they did.
