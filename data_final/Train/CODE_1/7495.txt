LAHORE: Construction to raise the walls of Gulshan-e-Iqbal Park, where a suicide blast killed 72, is underway.

Construction workers are seen laying bricks on the walls, at the otherwise deserted park, in an attempt to raise its height.

The entrance to the park is guarded by policemen and swings bear marks of the blood and gore the playground witnessed on Sunday.

Investigation of the explosion reveals that the suicide bomber climbed the low walls of the park to enter its premises.

However, the absence of barbed wire, to protect the walls is felt, a Geo News reporter at the site said.

The attack on Sunday evening in the busy Gulshan-i-Iqbal park killed mostly women and children enjoying an Easter weekend outing. Pakistan, a majority-Muslim country, has a Christian population of more than 2 million.

Sunday's terrorist attack was the deadliest incident since the December 2014 massacre of 134 school children at Army Public School in the city of Peshawar that prompted a military-led crackdown on militancy and terrorism.
