No More Blue Eyes And Light Hair! Muslim Brags About Committing Genocide Of German People

Freedom Outpost ^ | 5/17/2016 | Walid Shoebat

Posted on by HomerBohn

A major Islamic researcher, highly respected in her field, has said outright we are going to destroy you completely from your culture down to your biological makeup on a taxpayer-funded television stationa German equivalent of PBS or C-SPAN. No more blue eyes. No more light hair.

This video significantly irritates me.

Ive been saying it over and over here, but Merkel is planning a total genocide of the German people by demographics. Merkel & Co. have alluded to it. The average (instead of Joe) Mohammed on the street has said it. Now you have a major Islamic researcher, highly respected in her field, saying outright we are going to destroy you completely from your culture down to your biological makeup. Not only that, but she is saying it on a taxpayer-funded television station a German equivalent of PBS or C-SPAN.

(Watch the video at link)

to her words: No more blue eyes. No more light hair.

Im not going to even bother discussing what ifs, because you dont even need a brain to see this is truly, horribly, and unconscionably racist, and that nobody is getting prosecuted over this comment, but, rather, applauded. Yet this is the same Germany which, under Merkels government, has gone to excessive lengths to prosecute people who protest against the refugees for simply voicing the opinion that they are a problem.

Germany is a nation that has been steeped in sin, idolatry, and rebellion for a long time. It actually goes back to the early years of German history. Most people do not know this, but Christianity took root very early in Germany- except it was Arian Christianity. While Arius was an Egyptian, and most of the conflicts that we read about took place in Egypt, the Holy Land, Greece, and Anatolia, it is not discussed that Germany was a bastion of the Arian heresy for centuries, whose greatest ministers spreading that heresy were the Gothic peoples- both the Visigoth and the Ostrogoths. The Visigoth peoples, who later relocated to Spain, persisted in their heresy in spite of much fighting from the Church until about the year 711, when the Muslims invaded. In completion of their heresy, the remaining Arians mass converted to Islam.

As far as the German heartland is concerned, it took many centuries of missionary work from many good and holy men and women to convert that land- centuries of world. Think about it like this. If Germany became Arian around the year 350 (under the heretic Ulfias), and Germany did not really start becoming a non-heretical nation until about the year 750 under Pepin the Short (who was also a son of Charles Martel), then it was 400 years of missionary work to root out this heresy.

Four hundred years ago at this time, New Amsterdam did not even exist, and the Pilgrims who landed in Massachusetts were still in England.

There was also, most famously, the entire Protestant movement that came out of Germany and went on to spread a large number of heretical ideas all throughout Europe and the world. This has continued in modern times, not only through the funding of heretical sects, but also through many other bad ideas propagated from the same nation - socialism, positivism, quasi-Christian philosophies, secularism, and atheism. These are the same problems which, in combination with other issues, aided in creating the conditions during the 20th century for the First and Second World Wars.

And, as always, Christian apostasy is fulfilled in Islamization, so it begins that Muslim refugees now invade Germany and, barring any obstacles, will likely result in the Islamization of German society in several generations.

Now, Germany certainly has earned what is happening to it because it is tasting the fruits of its rebellion. At the same time, do we give up on Germany in spite of, to the contrary, the fact that is does have a long Christian history and did do many good and holy things?

Even if Germany does get what it deserves, that still leaves the other nations of Europe, especially those in Eastern Europe, to clean up the mess. Would you or I like to be responsible for, possibly, the Islamization of Poland, Slovakia, or Ukraine because we gave up on Germany because we were upset with them?

Something I have learned over the years is that helping people is often times not just for the benefit of the other person, even though that is (or ought to be) the first motivating cause for action. Rather, when we help others, we ultimately help ourselves, and sometimes in ways that we do not realize at the time - sometimes not even ever until our deaths, when we will see our lives in full review.

The same goes for forgiveness. We forgive others because, as a first cause, it is the good, moral, and right thing to do because God Himself has commanded it. At the same time, by forgiving others, we also bring forgiveness for our own sins:

But if you do not forgive others, then your Father will not forgive your transgressions. (Matthew 6:15)

As far as Germany is concerned, as much as I am very frustrated with that country because of her obstinate attitudes towards sin and the only recent wake up among her people, I am also NOT going to nurse a grudge against her. Germanys rise or fall affects us all and, even more importantly, those who comes after us. It would not be merely foolish, but criminally negligent to ignore Germanys sufferings at the refugee situation because the effects would not only directly impact us but would also affect the countless numbers of people yet unborn and, most importantly, whose souls might be in jeopardy because of our choices today.

By the way, Ms. Kaddor is known well among the Muslims. After all, five of her students joined ISIS. Personally, I dont believe she was as horrified as she said she was.

Seriously, what more will it take for people to understand that if you are a native European, you are being targeted for extinction?

And yet Angela Merkel remains chancellor! The Russian Orthodox Church has declared Holy War against Islam. Meanwhile America is ruled by a Muslim who hates the nation and is working industriously to bury it and its people. Putin is a far, far better human being than the evil Soebarkah.

"There was also, most famously, the entire Protestant movement that came out of Germany and went on to spread a large number of heretical ideas all throughout Europe and the world." At that point the author alludes to Germany may just get what it deserves as punishment because of it's many heretical movements. I was fully applauding the article and agreeing with it up to the point where it said:At that point the author alludes to Germany may just get what it deserves as punishment because of it's many heretical movements. I think that if the author wants to go in this direction, then I will point out that just possibly the evil that Germany committed during the reformation was in persecuting the protestant reformers. Of course it would be best to just focus on the fact that Islam's goal is to conquer all. However I cannot allow the author to insult the protestant Christians and when he does, he loses all respect in my eyes.

http://www.counter-currents.com/2013/01/new-zealand-academiastudies-in-corruption-part-1/ Dear Dr. Dentith, I do not have a PhD but I am an educated person and I have read Mr. Boltons work. I follow this site regularly. Since you are interested in right-wing conspiracy theories, perhaps you have heard that many white racists believe that white people have been targeted for genocide by mass immigration into ALL white countries and forced integration with non-white immigrants. As Im sure you know, whites are effectively precluded from organizing in our own best interests or even socializing together for fear that some anti-racist will inform our employers, or even the FBI, that we are associating with racists, which so far as I can tell means a white person who wants white people to continue to exist. My question for you is this. Do you see us as irrational conspiracy kooks for this despite the following public statements by prominent officials: (1) There is no place in modern Europe for ethnically pure states. Thats a 19th century idea and we are trying to transition into the 21st century, and we are going to do it with multi-ethnic states. -General Wesley Clarke (Notice there is no objection to ethnostates in Africa or Asia.) (2) Défi du métissage que nous adresse le 21ème siècle. Ce nest pas un choix, cest une obligation, cest un impératif. On ne peut pas faire autrement. Si ce volontarisme républicain ne fonctionnait pas, il faudra que la république passe à des méthodes plus contraignantes encore. -Nicholas Sarkozy (The challenge of race mixing in the 21st Century. Its not a choice, its an obligation, an imperative. We cannot do otherwise. If republican voluntarism doesnt work, it will be necessary to to move on to more coercive measures.) (3) Mass immigration was the way that the government was going to make the UK truly multicultural . . . the policy was intended  even if this wasnt its main purpose  to rub the rights nose in diversity and render their arguments out of date. -Andrew Neather, former advisor to Tony Blair (I presume render their arguments out of date means bury any notion that the British Isles belong to indigenous white people.) (4) We have tipped beyond the point where a Nazi-Aryan party will be able to prevail in this country . . . We [Jews] have been nourishing the American climate of opposition to bigotry for about half a century. That climate has not yet been perfected, but the heterogeneous nature of our population tends to make it irreversibleand makes our constitutional constraints against bigotry more practical than ever. -Earl Raab, Jewish activist (5) The strengthening of multicultural or diverse Australia is also our most effective insurance policy against anti-Semitism. The day Australia has a Chinese Australian Governor General I would be more confident of my freedom to live as a Jewish Australian. -Miriam Faine, editor of Australian Jewish Democrat (6) In Florida, theres going to be hundreds of thousands more Latinos and African-Americans voting than there were last time. The demographics of some of these states are already improved, through nothing weve done. -David Plouffe, Senior advisor to Barack Obama (7) The non-Europeanization of America is heartening news of an almost transcendent quality. -Ben Wattenberg, NYT reporter (?) (8) I think theres a resurgence of antisemitism because at this point in time Europe has not yet learned how to be multicultural, and I think were gonne be part of the throes of that transformation, which must take place. Europe has not yet learned how to be multicultural. Europe is not going to be the monolithic societies that they once were in the last century. Jews are going to be at the center of that. Its a huge transformation for Europe to make. They are now going into a multicultural mode, and Jews will be resented because of our leading role. -Barbara Lerner Spectre, director of Zionist organization Paideia (In The Jewish Stake in Americas Changing Demography, Joseph Steinlight admits that the Jews are behind the ethnic cleansing of whites in America as well. ) (9) But if the European example is much poorer in terms of the integration of workers into their society, in terms of their getting jobs, that is related to the fact that the United States or Australia and New Zealand are migrant societies and therefore accommodate more readily those from other backgrounds than we do ourselves, who still nurse a sense of our homogeneity and difference from others, which is precisely what the European Union, in my view, should be doing its best to undermine. -Peter Sutherland, UN Migration Chief (What do all these countries have in common?) (10) Our most important task ahead is to deconstruct the majority, and we must deconstruct them so thoroughly that they will never be able to call themselves the majority again. -Norwegian social anthropologist Thomas Hylland Eriksen (11) Effekten av SD var att vi fick en politik i motsatt riktning, förklarade statsministern belåtet.

-Fredrik Reinfeldt, Prime Minister of Sweden (The effect of SDs [immigration restrictionist party] entrance into Parliament is that we pursued the opposite policy) (It appears ABB was right when he said no peaceful solution to white genocide is possible because a vote for immigration restriction will just be punished with more immigration.) Once again, I ask you, in all good faith, do you believe I am paranoid for believing that these statements are evidence that demographic change throughout formerly Western countries is not just happening but rather a conspiracy to finish off white people? How should I, as a white person, interpret these statements? Perhaps the most outrageous thing about the ethnic cleansing of whites in ALL white countries is that whites are manipulated into accepting the end of their race and cultures by way of collective historical guilt. Yet non-whites hear the same anti-white propaganda that is targeted at whites, which of course winds up making non-whites hate white people. The same rhetoric that is used to soften up whites for cold, non-violent genocide could very well incite non-whites to hot genocide against us. Dehumanization is Stage 3 of Genocide according to Genocide Watch. Of course, our achievements and contributions to human welfare are simply ignored or attributed to dumb luck. I sincerely hope you reply as I am very much interested in your point of view on these matters.

I guess the are beginning with destroying the written language. The article is filled with run-on sentences, improper tenses, improper punctuation, and more. Perhaps if the author could study some Church History, she might be led to Christ.

"The creation of a new religion is rampant in all Christian ranks." You are right about that. "False teachers/prophets" seem to be popping up all over the place. I think the point that MayflowerMadam and I were trying to make is that the author would have done better to focus on the current evil of Islam's aim to conquer Europe and leave out his Roman Catholic hated of Protestants.

As an avowed Sedevacantist, I believe that the RCC has created a new religion that progressed following Vatican II. The new religion has very little to do with Jesus Christ or God and much to do with mankind. It’s highly regrettable that the Protestant Churches have rapidly followed suit.

Throughout Europe and the US there is a war on white people. It is not a coincidence that predominantly white countries are being flooded by their governments with non-whites for no rational purpose. The vast majority of these “migrants” are not skilled, educated, self sufficient or generally desirable. In an age of terrorism why would any sane nation import millions of military aged males from countries where terrorism is rampant and the culture is incompatible with Western forms of govt. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF BRINGING THEM IN other than to change the demographics/voting patterns? It’s not by chance that we see these same irrational actions taken by govts all over the world. Does it make sense when the “migrants” begin raping and assaulting the women in these countries and the govt SIDES WITH THE MIGRANTS? Something sinister is happening and its NOT by accident.

“Hot genocide” in a nation wrapped in the 2nd Amendment is risky to the usual suspects - melanin enhanced activists. Rule 1 in the “Handy Dandy Handbook of Genocide” is:

We better learn from the suicides of America, England, Holland and France, if we are to survive as a nation. The Russian customs and traditions are not compatible with the lack of culture or the primitive ways of most minorities. When this honorable legislative body thinks of creating new laws, it should have in mind the national interest first, observing that the minorities are not Russians. Vladimir Putin 2013

While I find their articles on Islam informative, the Shoebats are Romeophiles and heretics themselves. The break from the Roman Church brought freedom of conscience and the Bible to the Western World, hidden so long by Roman Clergy. It also brought the Treaty of Westphalia and the Nation State was born and fought to end the Roman Church's Inquisition. These men have become apologists for Pope Francis, who ironically is leading Christendom to Islam!?!

"Its highly regrettable that the Protestant Churches have rapidly followed suit." Homer, the thing is that the Protestant churches are not all under one Pope or ruler. They are independent of each other. Even in the, for instance, Presbyterian heading, there are several different types because when the Presbyterian church started to become too liberal and stray from the Bible scriptures back in the late 50's, a conservative branch called the PCA was formed. The beauty of this is that when a protestant church strays from what one considers to be true biblical tenets, one can leave and find a church that still follows Christ. When one puts Christ the head of the church rather than a man such as the Pope, then we can omit a lot of the human error. What I am saying is that you are correct in that many Protestant churches have gone astray, but there are still many that closely follow Christ.

For eons Protestant Churches have watched the Vatican and in many cases over time they’ve actually agreed with what issued forth.
