Coalition Strikes Target ISIL Terrorists in Syria, Iraq

From a Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve News Release

SOUTHWEST ASIA, Oct. 11, 2016 â€“ U.S. and coalition military forces continued to attack Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant terrorists in Iraq and Syria yesterday, Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve officials reported today.

Officials reported details of the latest strikes, noting that assessments of results are based on initial reports.

Strikes in Syria

Attack, bomber and fighter aircraft conducted eight strikes in Syria:

-- Near Abu Kamal, a strike damaged a supply route.

-- Near Hawl, a strike engaged an ISIL tactical unit and destroyed a fighting position.

-- Near Dayr Az Zawr, three strikes destroyed three ISIL oil wellheads and an oil tanker truck and damaged two supply routes.

-- Near Manbij, three strikes engaged three ISIL tactical units and destroyed six fighting positions and two vehicles.

Strikes in Iraq

Attack, fighter and remotely piloted aircraft conducted nine strikes in Iraq, coordinated with and in support of Iraq's government:

-- Near Beiji, two strikes engaged an ISIL tactical unit and destroyed three fighting positions, two weapons caches, two bunkers and a tunnel entrance.

-- Near Haditha, a strike destroyed three ISIL vehicles.

-- Near Kisik, a strike engaged an ISIL tactical unit, destroying an ISIL-held building, a fighting position, a heavy machine gun and three tunnels. A trench and another tunnel were damaged, and a second tactical unit was suppressed.

-- Near Mosul, four strikes engaged an ISIL tactical unit, a staging area, six headquarters buildings, two media centers, a vehicle bomb facility and a weapons facility, destroying two ISIL-held buildings, a command-and-control node, an anti-air artillery system and a weapons cache.

-- Near Sinjar, a strike engaged an ISIL tactical unit and destroyed five fighting positions.

Task force officials define a strike as one or more kinetic events that occur in roughly the same geographic location to produce a single, sometimes cumulative, effect. Therefore, officials explained, a single aircraft delivering a single weapon against a lone ISIL vehicle is one strike, but so is multiple aircraft delivering dozens of weapons against buildings, vehicles and weapon systems in a compound, for example, having the cumulative effect of making those targets harder or impossible for ISIL to use. Accordingly, officials said, they do not report the number or type of aircraft employed in a strike, the number of munitions dropped in each strike, or the number of individual munition impact points against a target. Ground-based artillery fired in counterfire or in fire support to maneuver roles is not classified as a strike.

Part of Operation Inherent Resolve

The strikes were conducted as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, the operation to eliminate the ISIL terrorist group and the threat it poses to Iraq, Syria, the region and the wider international community. The destruction of targets in Syria and Iraq further limits ISIL's ability to project terror and conduct operations, officials said.

Coalition nations that have conducted strikes in Syria include the United States, Australia, Bahrain, Canada, France, Jordan, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. Coalition nations that have conducted strikes in Iraq include the United States, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Jordan, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.
