WATCH  Detective Comes Forward, Reveals Surprising Thing Trump Did to Stop Rape in NYC

Angry Patriot Movement ^ | 10/11/2016

Posted on by BlackFemaleArmyCaptain

In a viral Facebook post released by Trump supporters, a video chronicles just one of the many things that Donald Trump has done to help keep women safe. In the video, a former New York City Police Department detective talks about the East Side Rapist case a case that haunted Manhattan for years in the 1990s. Had it not been for Donald Trumps role in disseminating critical information about the rapist, many more women would have been brutally raped by this predator.

In the late 90s I was involved in a case called the East Side Rape Case, the NYPD detective said. The case was a serial rapist who at gunpoint raped and sodomized at least 16 victims. It was a terror campaign that went on for at least 3 years.

The detective explained how the case  a predatory exercise in brutality and violence  haunted the man to this day. Cases of extreme violence and brutality usually do affect people in law enforcement and EMS, just as horrific battles affect the men and women of our military.

We were doing all we could to capture this rapist, the detective continued. I wanted to do a mailing in the community. The mailer was so important to us; to get it to every single person that lived in the areas where he was attacking these women. The mailers cost anywhere from between $10,000 and $40,000 to do, and Mr. Trump willingly gave the [money] that we needed, and that happened just within a few days.

Well, there’s one story the MSM will never cover.

I remember that charming rape story. He was pushing girls into the vestibules of their homes. All over the east side which, for some nutty reason, was considered a safe neighborhood. I used to pass many of those vestibules to get into my doorman building and I was scared. Trump was always enraged about the rapes that were occurring at this period of time.

OK, the story is about Donald Trump putting up the funding for the mailers, and that’s a great thing he did, but I don’t find any information as to whether they got the bad guy, or not. Irrelevant I guess as the story is about Donald Trump helping the police.

TRUMP helps catch a rapist. ILLary calls her husband’s sexual assault victims “tramps.” OK, if that doesn’t make the good/evil dichotomy clear to some voters, NOTHING WILL.

CNN is sure to be all over this.
