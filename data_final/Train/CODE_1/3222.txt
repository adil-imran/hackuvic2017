Lagos State House of Assembly yesterday urged the Federal Government to provide joint security operation in coastal communities in the state to forestall incessant kidnapping by criminals using the waterways.

The House also called on the state Commissioner of Police Fatai Owoseni to ensure the provision of a police command in Epe and upgrading of police posts in the coastal areas

It also called on the ministry of education to ensure the enforcement of the resolution of the House in erecting walls round all primary and secondary schools in the state.

The lawmakers advised the state government to, as a matter of urgency, begin the implementation of the neighbourhood watch agency law to strengthen security in the coastal communities and that all boats plying Lagos waterways should be registered and numbered for easy identification and control.

These were part of the resolution of the House at plenary yesterday while reacting to a motion moved by Segun Olulade under matter of urgent public importance about the two kidnap incidents in his community.

The lawmaker told his colleagues about the two kidnap incidents within one week in his constituency at Epe where the principal, four students and a house master of Igbonla Model college, Epe, were abducted as well as the kidnap of a 70-year-old retired banker and three of his employees at Molajoye, also in Epe.

Olulade said: “We are endangered in Epe”, urging that the state security trust fund law should be looked into and strengthened to provide security on the waterways through the provision of gun boats and marine police stations.

He called for a full-fledged police station in Ketu and Ejirin as there was only one police station in the 68 communities making up his constituency.

The lawmaker, however, commended the Deputy Governor, Mrs Idiat Adebule and Mr Owoseni for their prompt response when they heard about the incident.

Speaker Mudashiru Obasa stressed the need for the government to implement all the laws and resolutions passed by the Assembly “as there seem to be no necessary measures put in place to stop kidnappers, we seem to be afraid to do what is necessary, we must do something”.
