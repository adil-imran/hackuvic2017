FATHER Tom Uzhunnalil has been crucified by Islamic State in Yemen. Nothing unusual about that. Crucifixion is IS’s preferred method of murdering Christians and Fr Tom’s cruel death made the news only because, with barbarous mockery, they did it on Good Friday. Thus one priest’s murder was meant to warn Christians everywhere that they are the targets of the violent Islamic insurgency on three continents.

Indeed, we have ample evidence of the terrorists’ policy which struck new depths of savagery when more than seventy people – mostly women and children – were murdered by the bombers in a park in Lahore on Easter day. A sect of the Taliban immediately announced that they had deliberately targeted those innocent families because they were Christian.

Of course, Christians are not the only people to be murdered by IS and other terrorist groups. They kill Muslims too. But it is becoming plain that what is being perpetrated is ethnic cleansing, genocide of the Christians. The UN has published a report to confirm that this is happening in 50 countries, among them North Korea, Syria, Iraq, Somalia, Nigeria, Mali, Egypt – where Coptic Christians have been almost wiped out – as well as Pakistan and Yemen. Twelve years ago there were 1.5 million Christians in Iraq. Today only a few thousand are left. Mosul in Iraq was captured by IS in 2014 and all the Christians slaughtered or forced to flee. That city was home to one of the oldest Christian communities in the world. Christians are being obliterated throughout the Bible lands. In his Easter sermon the Archbishop of Canterbury said, “Christians are facing elimination in the very regions in which Christian faith began.”
