BARBERTON, Ohio - A Barberton man was sentenced to serve two years in prison for not disclosing his involvement in ethnic cleansing in his immigration documents, the U.S. Attorney's Office reported.

Slobodan Mutic, 53, lied on the forms about his role in the ethnically motivated murder of a Croation couple during the Bosnian War, the office reports.

Mutic was a soldier for the now-defunct rogue state Republika Serbian Krajina. The U.S. Attorney's Office said that, in 1992, Mutic admitted to participating in the murders of Stjepan and Paula Cindric, and is wanted for other crimes including murder in Croatia.

Mutic is expected to be deported to Croatia after his prison sentence and stand trial for other alleged human rights violations.
