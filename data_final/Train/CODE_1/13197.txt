The Observatory and Abu Leila, who is from Deir el-Zour but lives in Europe, said the sandstorm reduced visibility in Deir el-Zour, giving advantage to IS fighters who pressed their offensive without fear of being hit from the air by Syria's air force, grounded by the bad weather.

Over the weekend, IS captured several areas in Deir el-Zour province, killing scores of troops and civilians and capturing hundreds in this province bordering Iraq, according to activists and state media.

The extremist group appears to be trying to reverse a string of defeats in Syria and Iraq over the past months. IS controls most of Deir el-Zour province and much of the capital with the same name, while the government controls several districts in the northern part of the city and the adjacent military airport. If IS captures the whole city of Deir el-Zour it will be a major boost for the group as they will be in control of two provincial capitals in Syria. IS already controls the northern Syrian city of Raqqa — the militant group's de facto capital — in the province by the same name.

Syria's government said Sunday that IS killed 300 people in an "appalling massacre" over the weekend in the city of Deir el-Zour.

IS suffered the loss of the Iraqi city of Ramadi and parts of northern and northeastern Syria over the past months.

IS has tried to capture the government-held neighborhoods of Deir el-Zour and the city's suburbs over the past months without much success.
