Bahrainis Slam Manama Regime’s Ban on Friday Prayers

TEHRAN (FNA)- Dozens of Shiita Muslims staged a demonstration in Bahrain to condemn a regime-imposed ban on holding Friday prayers in the country, and to denounce the al-Khalifa regime’s crackdown on the majority Shiita community.

On Friday, the protesters marched along the streets in the Northwestern village of Diraz, situated about 12 kilometers (seven miles) west of the capital, Manama, after Bahraini regime forces closed roads leading to the Imam Sadiq Mosque and refused to allow Muslims to converge at the place of worship, press tv reported.

The worshipers insisted on their right to perform religious rituals without the regime’s interference, demanding an end to the ongoing sectarian discrimination against them.

Bahraini authorities have either arrested or summoned more than a dozen Shiita clerics over the past few weeks.

Bahraini Shiita clerics, in a statement titled “Those Barred from Praying” released on June 16, condemned the Manama regime’s efforts to restrict Shiita Muslims’ freedom of religion and belief, describing the situation in the country as “deplorable.”

The statement said that the al-Khalifa regime’s systematic suppression of Bahraini Shiita Muslims had reached its highest level ever, and members of the kingdom’s largest religious community felt insecure and faced threats of arrest and prosecution if they sought to observe their religious rituals, primarily Friday and other congregational prayers.

Anti-regime protesters have staged numerous demonstrations in Bahrain on an almost daily basis since February 14, 2011, calling on the al-Khalifa regime to relinquish power.

Troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — themselves repressive Arab regimes — were deployed to the country in March that year to assist the Manama government in its crackdown on peaceful and pro-democracy rallies.

Scores of people have been killed and hundreds of others injured or arrested in Manama’s crackdown on the anti-regime activists.
