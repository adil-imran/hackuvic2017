Bijbehara

Remembering the victims of ‘Bijbehara massacre’ a pro-freedom rally is being held at Jamia Masjid Bijbehara on Saturday, in which hundreds of people from adjoining localities participated.

The massacre took place on October 22, 1993, when thousands of people came out to protest the siege of Dargah Hazratbal. The peaceful procession was fired upon by BSF personnel, posted in the highway town that left at least 32 civilians dead.

The rally is led by the local religious leaders and Hurriyat leader Sabzar Ahmad Dar.

Later, a prayer meet is also scheduled at the Martyr’s graveyard for those killed in the massacre.

Twenty two years after the Bijbehara massacre, the government is yet to identify the people responsible for the killing of civilians . The government, then led by governor, had ordered a magisterial inquiry into the killings after the BSF unit that carried out the massacre was withdrawn.

While NHRC had taken cognizance of the massacre, state government had also initiated a magisterial inquiry. But in neither of the cases any action was taken.
