The illegal existence of the Armenian Armed Forces in the Azerbaijan`s occupied territories continues to be serious threat to escalation of the situation and regional peace and stability. Armenian armed forces perpetrated the provocation and the ceasefire roughly breached. The Armed Forces attacked the positions of Azerbaijan and the settlements with the heavy weapons, artillery. As the result of that dozens of civilians were injured, died, the building, private houses were destroyed.”

The appeal also says that the resolutions of the Security Council, the United Nations reaffirmed that Nagorno-Karabakh region is an integral part of Azerbaijan and demands unconditional, complete, immediate withdrawal of the Armenian occupying troops from Azerbaijan`s lands. “Unacceptability of maintaining the status-quo was also emphasized by the Co-chair countries of the OSCE – Presidents of the US, Russia and France.
