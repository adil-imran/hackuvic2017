Nadine Hernandez, one of two Los Angeles Police Department detectives who were conducting a criminal investigation into a sexual assault allegation lodged against New York Knicks guard Derrick Rose, was found dead of a single gunshot wound Tuesday afternoon in a suburban Los Angeles home, the Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday. She was 44.

Lt. Steve Dean of the Whittier Police Department said police received a call on Tuesday afternoon reporting an attempted suicide in a home registered to a retired LAPD lieutenant, whom the Times says is somehow related to Hernandez. She was taken to a local hospital and died a short time later.

Dean said police are unsure whether Hernandez’s death was a suicide or a homicide, but that the investigation is ongoing.

Hernandez worked for the LAPD’s Robbery-Homicide Division Special Assault Section, handling high-profile sexual assault cases. Last month, she confirmed the existence of the criminal investigation into the 2013 incident involving a woman who claims she was raped by Rose and two of his friends at her Los Angeles apartment. The woman has filed a $21 million civil lawsuit against Rose and the two men, a case that currently is being heard in U.S. District Court, and in September, Hernandez wrote a letter to the woman’s lawyer confirming the active criminal investigation. The woman’s lawyer, Brandon Anand, submitted the letter in an attempt to get Judge Michael Fitzgerald to reconsider his decision to have the woman identified during trial.

“The ability to offer anonymity to victims of sex crimes is an invaluable investigative aid to investigators as well as a great comfort to victims of crimes of such a sensitive nature,” Hernandez wrote.

Anand also used the letter to rebut allegations made by Rose’s defense team that the woman was lying about the existence of a criminal investigation “in order to extort a settlement from Rose.”

On Wednesday, Fitzgerald decided against a mistrial in the case after Rose’s lawyers alleged that the plaintiffs failed to disclose the existence of text messages that would help their client’s case. Fitzgerald said Rose’s attorneys will be allowed to question his accuser about the text messages, which he said “could be viewed as favorable to the defense,” according to the Los Angeles Times.
