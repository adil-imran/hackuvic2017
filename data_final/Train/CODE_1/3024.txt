Think The Trump Video Changed A Lot Of Minds? Maybe Not.

The Huffington Post ^ | October 10, 2016 | Ariel Edwards-Levy, Reporter and Polling Director

Posted on by 2ndDivisionVet

Even before the release of a video that showed Donald Trump bragging about sexual assault, most voters didnt think he respected women. But Fridays revelation had only a modest effect on the minds of those who did, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov survey.

Thirty-two percent of registered voters now think Trump respects women, identical to the percentage who said so in a poll taken days before the videos release. The share who say he does not respect women rose from 54 percent to 59 percent, as some people left the not sure camp.

The percentage of voters who say that a Trump presidency would be bad for women ― 46 percent ― is also up only slightly from the 42 percent who said so prior to Friday afternoon.

The lack of change shows how deeply opinions can harden along partisan lines, with voters willing to rationalize away criticism of the candidate they support.

While just 48 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning voters said in April that Trump respected women, that number rose to 60 percent once he became their partys nominee ― and its stayed there. In the post-video survey, 60 percent still say that Trump respects women. A quarter say that he does not, up from 20 percent in the previous poll....

More crap thrown up on every wall, I guess. This is NOT going to help Hillary, nor the POS GOPEers!



To: 2ndDivisionVet

What now? God bless and protect Trump and his secret service detail. Amen.

They lecture to the public for years on how nobody should be the judge of morality , what a person dies, says or feel about sex in their private life is their own business and should not be a litmus for governing. Then they are surprised that people don't care about Trump... honestly there is no pleasing liberals other than allowing them full control to make up the rules of whats wrong and right as to what ever whim suits their agenda ..

Bragging about sexual assault? I must have missed that. Trump was talking about how certain types of women are receptive to sexual touching/groping when you`re wealthy and famous. Of course, the femenist left views any sexual contact between a man and woman to be assault.

You see, it is what he actually said that so infuriates the libtards but they can not admit that what he said is in any case true.

Have 538, yougov, nbc/wall street journal show staggering leads for hillary and try to crush Trump voters into not showing up. lies, lies and more lies. Shouldn’t even be called an election. It is like a Russian election. When the media is so INCREDIBLY biased (can’t find any wikileaks at the big msm guys) then a country is past elections and onto revolution.

He’s up 2 percent in daybreak poll, down from 3, but it’s a very fluctuating poll.

Can any rational human being hold the belief that Hillary respects women? Trump’s policies will be good for America—that includes women. I don’’t believe we need our own separate president.

The other day I heard some pundit say that because of this even Kansas may go blue. Gee, Toto!

Good point. It`s alot easier to misrepresent what he said and get worked up over that. A classic strawman argument at work..



To: mbrfl

The Feminazis can’t admit that after five decades what he said is true. What matters to many women, especially attractive women, is the size of a guy’s wallet. In some cases they will even let very wealthy men treat them like whores.

My bad. I gues if Hillary wins, she`ll have to send me to reeducation camp.



To: wastoute

One thing Clinton has in common with any dimwitted democrat is they all lie. He has never made racist comments about minorities. He said rapists were included in hordes of illegals that pore over the border daily,which is fact. He said Muslims need to be vetted better. He said he wants to put blacks to work. He has not disrespected veterans. He did not disrespect McCain. McCain is no hero because he was a POW.His actions as a POW were treasonous. His actions as a veterans advocate are despicable. He votes with democrats.Trumps “war with women” is 100% BS. He employs more women than men and they get paid just as much or better. He never called Capt Khan or the Khan family disparaging names. I could go on forever. The media is out to destroy him, by lying. End of story.

To: mbrfl

Trump said (in crude language) what everybody knows to be true - money for nothing, chicks for free. Seems to me there was a song about it...

they would but have nothing on them that’s why Hilry said she thought they turned out well..she could not malign them.

It helped Trump big time because it gave him entre into the whole Bill Clinton rape and abuse scandals at the debate, especially when they opened with it. The millennials had no idea.

It made Trump even stronger. Hillary Clinton looked and acted like the last of “The Stepford Wives” robots.

The Dems can blame themselves - they worked hard to "normalize" and desensitize us for all sorts of perversions to include abortion and NAMBLA etc., then try to take the moral high ground and express outrage over some "bad words". Their "outrage" is as phony as they are.

I think people have pretty much made up their minds.



To: cardinal4

Just because Trump made those comments does not mean he doesn't respect women. Only a liberal douchebag would make that argument. I'm sure the writer thinks Bill Rapist Clinton has tons of respect for women. If we use liberal logic 90% of men don't respect women. That's because most men have said something similar or worse about women.

“So it didn’t work? What now?” They will bring up the next tape. What this election is about is the direction the country is headed. This is a crossroads election. We who want America to survive as we know it have no choice but to vote for Trump no matter what. It is about the country.



To: 2ndDivisionVet

So it didn't work? What now? I don't think Trump's idea of trotting out Jones, Broaddrick, et. al. had any impact either. Clinton's supporters aren't budging and neither are Trump's.



To: Impala64ssa

As this election cycle has proven, pundits blow a lot of hot air & nothing else. Kansas will vote Trump. Take it to the bank. Media is trying to BS us about Georgia too. Don’t believe them. Vote Trump 2016

I don’t think it was intended to change voters......it was about “rattling” the Clintons...and it did. You play hard ball with Trump he’s going to strike you out. It worked ...

I don't think it was intended to change voters......it was about “rattling” the Clinton's...and it did. You play hard ball with Trump he's going to play ball... In full view of the audience. Unlike the Clinton's who hide their dirty hands ....Trump let them clearly know....you play those cards and he'll counter-move....it was a wonderful way to checkmate! We know that Bill was rattled..and think about if your husbands women, that you threatened, were sitting in the audience of a critical debate you had to speak on....you have no control of the situation..... 'Psychological Warfare'...it was brilliant! After the debate Bill was seen “helping” Hillary down the the stairs they left in separate vehicles. This was not a victory lap they went into this debate believing...

I wrote.....”I dont think it was intended to change voters......it was about rattling the Clintons...and it did. You play hard ball with Trump hes going to strike you out. It worked ...” Your response...”We’ll see.” We’ll see what?...Did you not “see’ Trump certainly won ‘this round’ of debates?....Therefore mission accomplished and then some.



To: 2ndDivisionVet

But isn’t the latest Rasmussen proof it did work?



To: Parley Baer

So the Republic ends because Trump spoke what most men think in their minds?



To: Sam Gamgee

The tape says more about tawdry, gold digging type women than it does about Trump.



To: Sam Gamgee

Haven’t seen the Rasmussen yet, in the process of arranging a move.

Well...the pussy comment was over the top. But again, its not like this is James Dobson or Franklin Graham we are electing. It seems hypocritical of the left since they were not even phased by Bill's shenanigans in the White House.



To: FrdmLvr

True...I concur.



To: Sam Gamgee

Holier than thou liberals—an oxymoron.



To: DoodleDawg

Hey, troll-boy. The Millenials always thought Bill was just about free love and blow jobs. Most of them never heard any of the rest. Rather than trying to propagandize here, go on over to http://alamo-girl.com/0262.htm and cut-and-paste some of the MAINSTREAM news sources FROM THE TIME about what Clinton did to intimidate the women he assaulted, onto a bunch of SJW-infested sites.

Trump ain’t struggling. It is the media and the Hillary team that are in an utter, terrified panic.
