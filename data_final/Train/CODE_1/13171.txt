Geert Wilders: It is Time to Liberate the Netherlands

Gates of Vienna ^ | 7 Apr, 2016 | Baron Bodissey

Posted on by MtnClimber

On March 29, one week after the jihad massacres in Brussels, Geert Wilders, the leader of the Party for Freedom (Partij voor de Vrijheid, PVV) spoke in the Dutch Parliament about what had happened, and the danger that Islam poses to the Netherlands. He was immediately set upon by the usual ankle-biters of the Left (and the Center Right, i.e. the VVD) who denounced him for dividing the country.

In the video below, pay close attention to the back-and-forth between Mr. Wilders and his detractors  youll notice a subtle shift in the center of gravity of the debate. Some of his opponents now grudgingly concede his point that there is a problem with Islam in the Netherlands, and just savage him for his proposed solutions, or for being an extremist about it, etc. In other words, the argument is shifting from whether there is a danger posed by Islam to the best way to deal with that danger.

Many thanks to H. Numan and Kericjang for time-stamping the translation, and to Vlad Tepes for the subtitling:

The left and islamists are tied together at the waist.

The left and islamists are tied together at the waist. Natural bedfellows who share a hatred for responsibility, liberty, America, and Israel.



To: Mr. Mojo

BIG difference is the muslims will slaughter the lefties, BIG time.

The progs would be the very first ones on the Islamic head-chopping block, there’s no doubt.

absolutely. And they don’t see it coming. Only Israel clearly sees the absolute threat. Jews stand no chance unarmed against them.

After the Netherlands—Holland—liberate America, please.



To: dp0622

Jews stand no chance unarmed against them. And neither do the Europeans. Thank God and our Founders for the 2nd Amendment, 'cause we have far bigger problems than most Americans realize.



To: Mr. Mojo

what a depressing article. all after 9/11 no less. Those Saudi #####s. what was the number? 10 fold increase with them here. I see only a small light that will prevent civil war in the next 20 years. I hope that doesn’t happen but we keep letting millions of terrorists in and they are 90 percent on food stamps and having kids. talk bout national suicide.

I have been a big fan of Honorable Geert Wilders for more than a year now! Love this guy. I am also a huge fan of Dutch Masters art, viz Jan Vermeer - but that’s besides the point, sorry, just had to throw that in there. Save the windmills, stop the minarets.



To: dp0622

National suicide, cultural suicide. It seems to the be the Left’s natural inclination in both Europe and America. I hear ya — CW2 seems inevitable on this side of the pond if things don’t change drastically. In Europe, the situation is even more ominous — Caliphate West.

The “Right” in Europe and the USA like Republicans (George W. Bush calling Islam a ‘religion of peace’) are also too friendly with Islam because they believe in doing business with Muslim countries. There’s a lot of Muslim money invested in the Western nations supporting educational and business institutions.

Geert is Great! BTW, fine bumper sticker phrase you coined to save Holland - RE: “Save the windmills, stop the minarets.”

I read the entire transcript and there was a definite shift in the conversation among the speakers and it would be highly plausible that there was a shift of opinion in those listeners who did not speak. Wilder is an amazingly patient man. He knows his subject and speaks with the same clarity as did Churchill before WWII.

>> The left and islamists are tied together at the waist. Easier to sink.



To: MtnClimber

That is some damn fine rhetoric. But then again conservatives prefer dry tedious abstract “intellectualism” then wonder why they lose.

That was brilliant. I don’t expect the Netherlands to survive, not with so much ignorance of Islam.
