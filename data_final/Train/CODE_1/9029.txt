Baku. Mubariz Aslanov – APA. In connection with 31 March — the Day of Genocide of Azerbaijanis, the Congress of European Azerbaijanis have sent a letter to the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights, various European public and political organizations as well as government and non-government organizations, the State Committee on Work with Diaspora told APA.

Written in German and English, the letter provides detailed information on the genocide suffered by Azerbaijanis at the hands of Armenian nationalists 98 years ago — during March and April of 1918.

“Under the decree signed by Heydar Aliyev, 31 March is marked in Azerbaijan as the Day of Genocide. Although 98 years have passed since that genocide, these acts committed by Armenian nationalists have not yet been given any legal assessment. Having been left unpunished, Armenian nationalists became motivated to carry out new acts of genocide against the Azerbaijani people. As a result, Armenian armed units, on the night of February 25 to 26 in 1992, attacked and Azerbaijan’s Khojaly town and massacred its civilian population,” says the letter.

The letter calls on the international community to give an unbiased political and legal assessment to this aggression that is still ongoing against the Azerbaijani people. The letter urges the world’s leading organizations to show support to the just stance of Azerbaijan, impose sanctions on Armenia for turning genocide into state policy, and stop being indifferent to the violated rights of refugees and IDPs.
