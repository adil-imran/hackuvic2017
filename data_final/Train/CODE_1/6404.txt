Hillary Clinton and the Chain of Command at Waco

American Thinker ^ | October 23, 2014 | David T. Hardy

Posted on by Kaslin

Many politicians have a skeleton in their closet. Hillary Clinton has a cemetery, with a sign reading Waco.

The 1993 Waco showdown began when federal authorities rushed the communal home of a religious group, killing six of them, and losing four agents in return. The FBI then besieged the place with tanks and other armored vehicles, and ended up with the armored vehicles punching holes in the building, and injecting massive quantities of CS tear gas. When that didnt work, the tanks began to demolish the building, eventually smashing about a quarter of it and damaging the remainder. A fire broke out and 74 people died in the flames, including twenty-one children. It was the deadliest law enforcement operation in American history.

After the tragic debacle, the Clinton administration claimed that Attorney General Janet Reno had been solely responsible for the final assault. There had been no White House input during the siege, and at the end, President Clinton only acquiesced in a decision Reno had made.

Twenty-three years later, there are substantial reasons to doubt the truth of these claims. The evidence is strong that the Clinton White House was calling the shots, and that Hillary played a prominent role.

I don’t have any doubt Hillary directed this through RENO. But one thing that irks me is that no matter what you read about Waco, who/what started the fire, background actions, etc., they always seem to never give the precise number of civilians killed. I’ve seen 76 to 85, with 17-22 children killed, and I’ve seen where at least 12 age 5 or under were part (and that took some internet digging). Always in a hurry to scoot over that discussion it seems. BUT THEY ALWAYS GET THE NUMBER OF ATF AGENTS KILLED correct. I guess it’s that ATF lives matter thing, huh?

It was always clear that the attack at Waco was designed and executed by the Clintons to send a message to Conservatives. “Your guns won’t save you.” We came all unglued when the Soviets sent tanks into Czechoslovokia in 1968, and then the Democrats sent armored vehicles to attack Americans at Waco.

Thing is, so many locals here were happy to support them.

The ATF could have grabbed the leader any time they wanted when he came into town as he normally did. Instead they wanted a publicity raid and they got their asses handed to them on a silver platter. Then comes the whole regime down on the compound, ATF, FBI, local and state - even Lon (Ruby Ridge) Horiuchi was there. Not often mentioned is the MILITARY was there, supposedly in an ‘advisory’ role. Yeah, we’ve seen ‘advisory’ before, Viet Nam was riddled with it at the beginning. The bottom line is that any force that does anything to sieged civilians that ends up in multiple child deaths has no excuse. Everyone on the government side connected with that massacre should have been in prison a long time ago.

Hubbell couldn’t get through a Senate approval process so the Clintons put Reno in as puppet AG and put Hubbell in as a deputy. But really, Reno took orders from Hubbell, and Hubbell took them from the Clintons.



To: Gaffer

Absolutely correct. The feds found easy pickin’s in Waco because the town’s people had been watching a circus of lawsuits for years as the splinter groups of Seventh Day Adventist’s fought over that property. Instead of being horrified at the illegal military incursion the citizen zombies just sat back, ate popcorn, and continued to watch the circus. Just like good Romans. WalMart and every neighborhood convenience store made money on their items of “Support the ATF” and big banners out front welcoming the thugs. Ignorance. And the vast majority still blame Vernon Howell aka David Koresh instead of the invading forces if the Clinton Crime Family for the deaths.

Seem to remember Wesley Clarke was the local military commander.



To: Gaffer

I had friends in Waco who remember Koresh cruising the strip (Valley Mills?) in his camaro on Friday/Saturday nights. He would talk/preach in parking lots to the local kids. He would bring some people to the Health Club (a burger joint) from the compound as well. They would hand out literature about the end times and such. Point is, they could have grabbed him any old time in town.

Exactly. But Hillary wanted to push her early version of VRWC. She is a heartless bitch responsible for countless child deaths, IMO.



To: 1066AD

Maybe, I don't know...but this then begs the Posse Comitatus question. This government's response to that was “their role was purely advisory.” We've seen what “advisor” introductions become - Viet Nam was the worst example. SNIPERS, FLIR equipped helos, military assault vehicles, you name it. It sucks to high heaven and it has been going on for decades.....and our current soldiers stationed in foreign hostile lands aren't provided 1/10th of the support the Clintons used to murder all those VRWC religious nuts at Waco.



To: Kaslin

I would like to point out that the use of “cs” gas is a part of the big lie. It was “cn”, which is one reason noone got out. The proof is in the autopsies. CN coverts to cyanide in the bloodstream. The people at Waco were murdered by thr feral government.

“...they could have grabbed him any old time in town.” For what? Refresh my memory, and correct me if I am wrong.

IIRC, Koresh’s group was considered suspicious by the local concern trolls because it was a group of end-time believing religious “fanatics,” living in a commune (gasp!) with children and guns (gasp!) on the premises.

And, as you say, he’d also preach and hand out tracts about the end times in town. None of this is illegal, which is probably why Koresh wasn’t grabbed solo while in town. The arresters might have had to pay out millions for religious discrimination.

As I remember it, the Feds surrounded the compound after rumors of child abuse were floated by some of the locals.

Thus the Feds weren’t harassing uber-Christians, or violating anyone’s First and Second Amendment rights. They were saving the children by firebombing them.

Waco was one of the worst domestic abuses of federal power in history. To this day I am shocked that many Americans weren't particularly disturbed at the horrifying way innocent people, including many children, were put to death at Waco. I believe this was because the media so successfully demonized the Branch Davidians. This story about Hillary reminds me of one of the other great abuses of federal power in our history ... BJ Clinton's war against the Serbians. Iirc it was Hillary calling the shots there too. E.g., it was reported she was behind the bombing of the Serb TV building in Belgrade. Why did Hillary order it? Because Serb TV was "spreading propaganda," presumably about the Muslim invasion of Kosovo. But the people Hillary succeeded in killing were innocent tv technicians and make up girls. I've always thought this was the equivalent of, say, Serbia deciding to bomb CNN headquarters in Atlanta because CNN was spreading anti-Serbian propaganda.

I would like to point out that the use of cs gas is a part of the big lie. It was cn, CS is FAR worse than CN. CS will make you drown in your own mucous. CN is for police use, CS for military.



To: mumblypeg

“None of this is illegal, which is probably why Koresh wasnt grabbed solo while in town. The arresters might have had to pay out millions for religious discrimination.” If they had a warrant for his ARREST, they certainly could have grabbed him anywhere. If their warrant was to search the compound for illegal weapons and drugs, maybe not so much.

“Point is, they could have grabbed him any old time in town.” Yep... and don’t forget the sheriff at the time (Harwell, I think) stated that he could have nabbed him at a local club (Chelsea’s Street Pub... used to be at Richland Mall) with ease as Koresh quite often played music there. That sheriff also died under mysterious circumstances. Hmmmm. Wake up America.
