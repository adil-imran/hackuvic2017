Zaria students demand release of Zakzaky Emeka Okonkwo

Abuja – Some Muslim students at the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) in Zaria are protesting the detention of cleric, Allamah Shaikh Ibraheem Zakzaky, as well as others in detention.

The scholars are protesting under the banner of the Academic Forum of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (AFIMN).

They noted it was six weeks since when the Nigerian Army launched a coordinated crackdown massacre on members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN).

It is reported “tens” of students were killed by the Nigerian Army and hundreds more are still under detention.

“This is a display of inhumane and gross violation of fundamental human rights against fellow Nigerian citizens,” said AFIMN.

The group reported that based on the list that the Islamic Movement compiled, 750 men and women were either in military detention or murdered.

Among them are dozens of students, excluding the 220 others that are presently in Kaduna, they reported.

AFIMN demanded justice.

“We are calling for the immediate release of Allamah Shaikh Ibraheem Zakzaky and his wife as well as all others in detention. The perpetrators of these demonic acts be brought to book for the crime against humanity.”

Amid some violence, Zakzaky was arrested on December 12 at his house on his way to deliver a public lecture, according to IMN.

The army alleged that the violence was in response to an alleged attempt by the IMN members to assassinate an army leader. – CAJ News
