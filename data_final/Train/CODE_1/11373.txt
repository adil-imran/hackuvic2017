Washington has berated Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for using the term "ethnic cleansing" to describe the Palestinian Authority's aspirations to create its own state, saying Netanyahu's choice of words is "inappropriate and unhelpful."In a video message posted on Netanyahu's FB account, the PM that he has "always been perplexed by the notion" that the "Jewish community in Judea and Samaria [the Israeli name for the West Bank] is an obstacle for peace.""The Palestinian leadership actually demands a Palestinian state with one pre-condition: No Jews.
