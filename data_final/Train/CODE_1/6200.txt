Fourth-ranked Washington plays again on the road this week with a different challenge against pass-happy Cal than what the Huskies faced with run-oriented Utah last week.

The Huskies' top-ranked pass defense in the Pac-12 will try to contain the nation's most prolific passer, Cal quarterback Davis Webb, on Saturday night.

Webb, a senior transfer from Texas Tech, has attempted more passes than anyone in the nation (415) and has more touchdown passes (29) than any Power Five quarterback.

Washington sophomore Jake Browning has 28 touchdown passes with only three interceptions. Webb, who has eight interceptions, will face a Washington defense has yielded only 168.2 yards passing in five conference games. Webb is averaging 364.3 yards passing.

The Huskies (8-0 overall, 5-0 Pac-12) are coming off their most physical game of the season at Utah. Joe Williams, Utah's senior running back, rushed for 172 yards on 35 carries as the Utes amassed 33 minutes and 33 seconds of possession time but came up short 31-24 against the Huskies.

Cal (4-4, 2-3) lost to a resurgent USC, 45-24, last Thursday. The Golden Bears, executing coach Sonny Dykes' "Air Raid" offense, have run the most plays (695) in the Pac-12 and lead the conference in total offense (536.5 yards).

Dykes' defense has struggled, however, ranking No. 123 out of 128 teams allowing 505.9 yards a game.

The Huskies have shown strength on both sides of the ball. They remain ranked in the top 10 nationally in scoring offense (fourth at 46.1 points per game) and scoring defense (seventh at 15.8).

"I think each week is a new test, and I just like it when they answer hard tests," Washington coach Chris Petersen said after the win over the Utes, a highly-publicized game that should positively impact the Huskies' College Football Playoff ranking that is released Tuesday.

"They come out and they've been ready to play and we've started fast and got a good momentum going. So that's all fun. That's fun and that's nice. And I do like it when we get in these hard situations and you have to find a way -- I think that's going to give us some confidence down the road."
