Oliver Ivanovic, a former Serbian government official and head of a Kosovo Serb political party called Freedom, Democracy, Justice, told the appeals court in Pristina on Tuesday that his conviction should be overturned and that he should be acquitted.

Ivanovic said he did not order the murder of nine ethnic Albanians in Mitrovica in 1999 during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, when he was allegedly the leader of a paramilitary police unit.

“I wasn’t part of the crime scene and did not contribute to the 1999 event, as I didn’t agree with what happened,” Ivanovic told the court.

The Albanians were killed by so-called ‘Bridge Watchers’ - Serb hardliners who patrolled the main bridge in Mitrovica that divides the town into Serb and Albanian sectors.

Ivanovic’s lawyers claim that criminal procedures were violated and the facts were wrongly established at his trial which ended in conviction in January this year.

He also described the testimonies of key witnesses as unreliable.

The conviction in January caused anger among officials in Belgrade.

“The verdict is politically motivated rather than based on the law,” Serbian vice prime minister Rasim Ljajic said at the time.

Ivanovic however was found not guilty of inciting the killings of ten ethnic Albanians by the ‘Bridge Watchers’ during unrest that erupted in Mitrovica on February 3, 2000, when many Albanians were driven out of their homes by Serbs.
