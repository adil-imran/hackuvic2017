[JURIST] A federal court in Ohio on Tuesday sentenced [press release] Serbian refugee Slobodan Mutic to two years in prison for lying on immigration forms about his participation in ethnic cleansing and genocide in the former Yugoslavia. A spokesperson for the Cleveland District Attorney's Office said that Mutic will be sent back to Croatia to stand trial for war crimes following the completion of his sentence in the US. Interpol had issued a warrant for Mutic in 2002. In a 1992 affidavit, Mutic admitted to aiding in the killing a Croatian couple while serving in a Serbian militia group. In December Mutic pleaded guilty to lying on immigration forms, which is a federal crime.
