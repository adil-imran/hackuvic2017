The websites of Armenian embassies have been hit by a massive hacker attack, information security expert Sergey Martirosyan said.

“Azerbaijani hackers are continuing their actions related to January 20 (editor: an anniversary of the Armenian massacres in Azerbaijan),” S. Martirosyan said.

According to him, Azerbaijani photos have been removed from the websites, and the websites of all embassies remain offline at the moment.

“It is the first serious attack on a segment of Armenia’s state network since September 2009,” Martirosyan said.
