– Sheikh Ibraheem El-Zakzaky’s elder brother has supported the Nigerian army actions in Zaria

– The Shiite group was reportedly funded by Iran

This might sound unbelievable but the elder brother of Sheikh Ibraheem Yaqoob El-Zakzaky, the leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), Muhammad Sani Yaqoob has backed the Nigerian army actions during the unrest in Zaria, on Saturday, 12 December 2015.

Explaining his position Mr Yaqoob said the army would have been useless if they stepped back at the sight of Shia Muslim community members blocking the convoy of Lieutenant General Tukur Buratai, the chief of army staff.

Mr Yaqoob, who is the chairman of Jama’atu Izalatil Bid’ah Wa’iqamatis Sunnah, (JIBWIS) in Zaria, also shed light on his and his brother’s origin. He said they shared the same father but different mothers, there was no rivalry between them in childhood.

His younger brother, who is the 4th child in the family of 16, Mr Yacoob described as very sharp and intelligent. Muhammad Sani Yaqoob himself is the chairman of Jama’atu Izalatil Bid’ah Wa’iqamatis Sunnah, (JIBWIS) in Zaria.

Speaking at the ongoing judicial commission of inquiry probing the clash between soldiers and Shiites, Mr Yacoob said: “They (the Shiite group) are funded by Iran. They go to Iran twice in a year and they meet there. I have people who after they come back from their trip do come and tell me.”
