SRINAGAR: A BSF jawan was killed accidentally while he was retaliating to ceasefire violation by Pakistani troops in Macchil sector along the Line of Control in Kashmir.BSF constable Nitin Subhash sustained grievous injuries last evening when an explosion inside the chamber of the long range weapon led to a recoil while he was firing in retaliation to ceasefire violation from across the LoC, BSF IG (Kashmir) Vikash Chandra said."Subhash was injured due to recoil and was admitted to a medical facility where he succumbed late last night," the official said.Earlier, a top BSF official had said that the jawan was killed today in firing by Pakistani troops.28-year-old Subhash, hailing from Sangli in Maharashtra, had joined BSF in 2008 and is survived by his wife and two sons aged four years and two years.Pakistan Rangers also violate ceasefire in RS Pura and Kathua sectors along International Border today.In Macchil sector, terrorists, aided by the cover fire by Pakistani Army, had last night crossed the Line of Control in the sector. They killed an Indian army jawan and mutilated his body prompting the Indian army to warn that "the incident will be responded to appropriately".Four army and three BSF personnel have died in the latest escalation along the boundary with Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir.In last night's attack, one militant was also killed."In an encounter close to the Line of Control this evening, one solider was martyred and one terrorist was killed. The terrorists mutilated the body of the jawan before fleeing back into Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir under the cover of firing by Pakistan Army," an army spokesman had said.He said the incident reflected the barbarism pervading in official and unofficial organisations in Pakistan.Two civilians were also killed and as many injured yesterday after Pakistani troops pounded civilian areas and forward India posts with 120 mm mortar shells and automatic weapons in Jammu, Kathua, Poonch and Rajouri districts.BSF yesterday said that it had killed 15 Pakistani soldiers in retaliatory firing along IB so far after the flare up started.
