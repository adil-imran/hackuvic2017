ISIL Speicher Butcher Killed South of Kirkuk

TEHRAN (FNA)- Iraqâ€™s security forces killed a senior ISIL member wanted for the June 2014 massacre of hundreds of military recruits in the central city of Tikrit, a security source said on Sunday.

the security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Arabic-language al-Sumaria TV that Iraqi forces clashed with ISIL militants near Hamrin Mountains, south of of Kirkuk, killing the wanted militant, identified as Ali Salman, nom de guerre al-Azirah, and three of his aides in the process, International Business Times reported.

Around 1,700 recruits were seen being massacred in a gruesome video released by ISIL after they stormed the former US base at Camp Speicher on 12 June 2014.

Also a bomb planted in the nearby neighborhood of Hosseiniyeh, killing one person and injuring eight.

Iraqi security forces are now in control of the site, said BOC Lieutenant General Abdul Amir al-Shammari. Although ISIL has not yet officially claimed responsibility, the combination of a truck bomb and suicide bombers are consistent with the group's usual methods.

ISIL is losing territory across Iraq and neighboring Syria and has lost many of its most high-profile leaders, but continues to wreak havoc where it can. Baghdad has been a regular target of bombings and attacks.
