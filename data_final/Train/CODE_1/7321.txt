Srinagar: Complete shutdown was observed in Sopore, today, to mark the 23rd anniversary of the deadliest massacre in the town.

All shops and business establishments remained closed while traffic was of the road. Only Indian police and paramilitary forces were seen patrolling the roads of the town.Over 60 civilians were martyred and more than 350 shops and other structures including residential houses were gutted on this day in 1993 after Indian soldiers set the town ablaze. The victim families are still awaiting justice while the involved personnel are roaming free.

The memories of one of the bloodiest massacres carried out against the civilian population in the Valley remain fresh in hearts and minds of the people particularly residents of the apple town even after the passage of 23 years.
