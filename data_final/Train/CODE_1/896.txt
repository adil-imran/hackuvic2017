Lagos lawyer Femi Falana (SAN), has urged the Federal Government and Nigerians to shoot down the proposal to sell some valuable national assets, particularly in the oil and gas sector of the economy.

Biusiness mogul, Aliko Dangote, the National Assembly and others had suggested that some assets, including gthe Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) Limited be sold to get the economy out of recession.

The promoters of asset sales argued that the proceeds from such endeavour should be used to boost Nigeria’s foreign reserves.

But in a statement in Lagos yesterday, the activist-lawyer warned against seeling the NLNG, a lucrative subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), which he insisted, has earned the government good revenue over the years.

“If all assets are sold, how would the government fund the budgets of 2017-2019?”, he asked.

The lawyer quoted the 2016 facts and figures of the NLNG to justify why the gas company should not be sold.

According to him, “the total revenue from 1999 to 2015 was $90.3 billion while the figure for the last five years was $ 48.54 billion.

“Capital investment from 1999 to 2015 was $15.6 billion while the figure for the last five years was $ 1.3 billion”.

He said the dividend paid to NNPC (FGN) from 2004 to 2015 was $15.3 billion while the figure for the last five years was $8.74 billion while dividend (net of withholding tax (WHT), paid to other shareholders from 2004 to 2015 was $16 billion while the figure for the last five years was $9.43 billion.

He went further: “Gas purchase from NNPC from 1999 to 2015 was $11.8 billion while the figure for the last five years was $7.39 billion.

“Gas purchase from ( Shell, Total , Agip and Conoco/Phillip) was $9.6 billion while the figure for the last five years $6.3 billion”

He listed the Company Income Tax and Education Tax paid from 2011 to 2015 as $3.8 billion: PAYE – $ 334 million (from 1999 to 2015): VAT – $ 647 million ( from 2005 to 2015), state and local government area taxes – $8.1 million (from 2007 to 2015).

He said the regulatory fess, levies among others was $ 299 million (from 1999 to 2015) while WHT was $946 million (from 1999 to 2015).

Besides kicking against what he called “illegal”sale of the lucrative enterprise, the activist urged Nigerians to demand for the account of the dividend, taxes, levies of over $33 billion collected on behalf of the Government of Nigeria by the NNPC from 2004-2015.

The NLNG was incorporated in 1989 and its shareholders at inception include: NNPC ( representing Federal Government of Nigeria) 49 per cent; Shell Gas BV- 25.6 per cent ; Total LNG Nigeria Limited- 15 per cent and ENI International- 10.4 per cent

The NLNG on its own, has two wholly- owned subsidiaries, including Bonny Gas Transport (BGT) and NLNG Ship Management Limited (NSML).
