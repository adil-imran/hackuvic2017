AhlulBayt News Agency - On Mothers Day we celebrate the brave and courageous women of Islamic Movement of Nigeria:



During the brutal Zaria Massacre by the Nigerian army that killed close to 1000 defenseless and unarmed Shia Muslims, the Nigeria army specifically targeted the lower pelvic region of women of IMN while chanting anti-Shia slogans such as “you will not born Shia again in Nigeria”.



During the inhuman Zaria massacre the women of IMN were shot in the private parts by the Nigerian army and stabbed in their breast with riffle bayonets. Some IMN women were bombed with Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) in the Zaria Husseiniyyah…..



During the barbaric Zaria massacre the Nigerian army burnt some women of the IMN alive and their children. The 70 year-old sister of Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky was burnt alive by the Nigerian army after been shot.
