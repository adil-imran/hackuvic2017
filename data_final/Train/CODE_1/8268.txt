The Indian Association of Peoples’ Lawyers mourns the sad demise of Bojja Tarakam, a lawyer of Hyderabad who dedicated his entire life to serve people’s struggles especially those of the dalits and other oppressed communities. He was 77. Bojja was suffering from brain tumor since 2007. He had argued Rohith Vemula’s social boycott at University of Hyderabad.

As an advocate, he filed a case in Supreme Court against police encounters with a demand that cases should be booked against officers involved in encounters and investigate them. He won the case in the Supreme Court. Tarakam was popular for his fight against the culprits in the infamous Tsundur massacre of Dalits in Andhra Pradesh in August 1992. He resigned as pleader of High Court in 1984 protesting against the upper caste people who attacked Dalits in Karamchedu in Guntur district in AP.

He was not merely a lawyer and a democratic rights activist but also a leader, poet, orator. He penned several books on rights movement, which includes Police Arrest Cheste, Dalitulu Rajyam, Kulam Vargam. He was the son of Bojja Appalaswamy, another great leader and contemporary of Dr.B.R.Ambedkar. Tarrakam was also the president of Republican Party of India (RPI), Telangana Unit. He even boldly stated that Dalit victims who daily faced atrocities, should retaliate against the perpetrators and assured them that he will fight their cases and free them, if penalized.

Long Live Bojja Tarakam!
