The man hired by the city of New Orleans to remove four Confederate statues has had his 2014 Lamborghini Huracan set on fire and reduced to rubble.

According to authorities in Baton Rouge, the St. George Fire Department found the $200,000 vehicle ablaze early Tuesday morning behind David Mahler's company, H&O Investments, LLC. The city announced a few days ago it had hired Mahler to remove the monuments, which symbolize Confederate history.

The car's tire rims and seat frames are the only things suggesting that it had once been a luxury ride.

"This is just a possession and can always be replaced, but someone has something to say to us," Mahlerâ€™s wife wrote on Facebook Tuesday.
