Is Civil Unrest Coming to Suburbia? Rest Assured, the Media Will Lie About It

The Organic Prepper ^ | August 18, 2016 | Daisy Luther

Posted on by akalinin

Many people watching Milwaukee burn on the news from the safety of their homes in the suburbs feel immune. It seems like this only happens in big cities, right? These people are burning down their own neighborhoods, how ridiculous, observers say. They feel safe in their belief that the issue is merely a war on cops, and its nothing that could happen to them.



While cities like Milwaukee and Baltimore have been hard hit, keep in mind that Ferguson, Missouri is a relatively small town with a population of just over 21,000 people at the last census.



Suburbia isnt the safe haven many believe it to be. And guess who is covering up the threat? Thats right. The mainstream news. It certainly wouldnt be politically correct if they were to air the fact that the sister of the armed man shot by police in Milwaukee actually directed her fellow rioters to head to the suburbs.



In fact, CNN did the complete opposite. They carefully edited a clip and flat out said Sherelle Smith was calling for peace. In my part of the world, they would call this kind of deception a lie, not a mistake.

This is why we have weapons. And why they will be used.



To: akalinin

I agree that the riots will eventually spread to the suburbs, but I don’t believe that it will be for very long and it will only happen in certain areas. In conservative strongholds, these types of riots and looting will be met with extreme violence early and it will never happen again. In extreme liberal areas, the residents will attempt to shut themselves in and wait for help. Help that will never arrive in time.



To: akalinin

People in suburbia don't riot. There is NEVER anyone home to see it. They go to the big urban areas to see the action and to be a part of it, via an uplifted fist or something inane like that. Besides, T.V. cameras wouldn't go to suburbia. They would get LOST beyond all things trying to find their way in all the cul de sacs.

They could HEAR the freeways a-churnin' and a-burnin' but they would NEVER be able to reach them.

They would have to wait for the weekends when everyone is out washing cars and mowing lawns. They can't hire Mexicans because THEY can't even find them with a GPS.

THEN they would have to ask someone to lead them out of the neighborhoods toward the FIRST freeway to ANYWHERE else.



To: CPONav

My code for the last 15 years has been to move as far as reasonably possible from urban areas staying away from rail lines, bus lines and near interstates. Given where I am now, it is 3-4 days of trekking without same conveniences, more time than most recently urban nomads will foray.



To: akalinin

When rioters burn down their own neighborhood, who cares! When they drive to the suburbs and start to burn down other people’s homes who have a vested interest in those homes the homeowner may FIGHT to prevent his investment being burned.

I asked a Boston Police Officer for directions from China Town to the Interstate Highway going west towards Ft. Devens. I didn't understand one word he said.

To: akalinin

Never happen. I was in and out of the projects and those neighborhoods a bunch of times. They are TERRIFIED of anything a few blocks past their neighborhood. We forget they are like frightened children when in unfamiliar territory, and we give them WAY TOO MUCH credit if we think they are going to organize and strike out. Big cities and suburban malls under threat from muslims. Minority neighborhoods under threat from themselves. Those are real threats. An attack on Suburbia would be an act of suicide. Staten Island has NYC’s gun laws of course, but everyone around here owns a business and has guns. Then there are the wiseguys. And now the crazy Russians and Albanians. (they dont do neighborhood crime, bad for business). IT would be a massacre.

“In fact, CNN did the complete opposite. They carefully edited a clip and flat out said Sherelle Smith was calling for peace. In my part of the world, they would call this kind of deception a lie, not a mistake.” Not so fast. They refrained from publishing what she advocated: burn down the suburbs.

We don’t need that idea promoted on major media.

Broadcasting such things is how the Rwanda slaughter started.

Let’s not go there.

Only if you have savages living among you and also how you define suburb. I live in the exurbs/suburbs, no problem here unless they relocate the savages as per the Castro brothers.



To: IWontSubmit

So eight hundred miles. You're moving to Antarctica? Because there is no place in the USA that is 800 miles from any city



To: Da Coyote

Bingo. I live about 20 minutes from two powder kegs (Philly and Camden) and we’re getting ready for the spillover.



To: dp0622

I think (hope) you’re right. There are barriers else they’d have done it by now. One being transportation, it’s one thing to wander down the street or round the corner in the hood, but quite another to saddle up a few hundred of your pals, gas up on the EBT card, and roll like thunder into a suburban neighborhood which is unfamiliar turf without the usual rabbit warren of hiding places and alternate routes. And you might say the typical BLM rioter would ‘stand out like a sore thumb’ in most of them. Moreover, people in those suburban neighborhoods own guns. And the BLM types know it. (Is there a lesson here?)

To: akalinin

Bam is sending his favorite people to live in areas with “too many” whites. If there is ever a critical mass, they will take over as they have in the cities. I don’t see that happening soon. This is why they want whitey’s guns and are deliberately letting violent minorities keep them.



To: Harmless Teddy Bear

Common sense? I agree. In a SHTF scenario, I don’t believe the urban thugs will leave the cities until gasoline is gone. They won’t think of things worth stealing and people worth robbing being between cities, so they won’t consider coming out until they have no choice. They will be on foot, and there will be almost no food left in the city before they even start walking. Getting ten miles out of the city will be a challenge for predators, particularly since the suburbs will also be in crisis. I am far more concerned with a partial collapse than with complete collapse. Hillary’s uniformed minions would be exceptionally dangerous, and they know who actually has food and weapons. They also have the power to try to take what we have - at a cost that Hillary is willing to watch others pay.

The suburbs at risk deserve this fate. They will be the Blue burbs inhabited by anti gun liberal elites. Let them burn. The barbarians wont go into neighborhoods where they know they will be exterminated like rats.

“I didn’t understand one word he said. “ Why? (Not sarcasm,just curious) .



To: CPONav

In conservative strongholds, these types of riots and looting will be met with extreme violence In liberal strongholds, the police will be ordered to disarm suburban residents "in the interests of public safety". The police will follow those orders. Residents who use any type of force in self-defense will be arrested. Rioters will not be arrested, though a few may be killed by residents. You can expect severe restrictions on the sale or possession of ammunition after the first such incident. There will be multiple waves of suburban invasion before this changes. There will also need to be replacement of discredited public officials at various levels. (Think sudden resignations or firings of police chiefs and city managers for example).

To: akalinin

The Glenn Echo riot in the 60s. Large mob of inner city youts threatened upscale suburban homes as they made their way back to the city. They were met with lots and lots of 12 gauge shotguns. Not a shot was fired, and not a single home was touched. The news first reported it, then later forgot the details.



To: akalinin

I think that when such a threat to suburbia becomes a reality, so many other circumstances will have also been altered; the most important of which, (if you live in suburbia); I believe, will be the ability to drive on interstates and other freeways to flee the chaos. I always think of the grid-lock on I-95 during Katrina. For all people, but for many people in particular, reliance on God will be their only hope!

To: Pollster1

I agree with you on the partial being more dangerous then the full in many ways. But in either case you need a group to keep your area safe. So get to know your neighbors. Most will not be into prepping but there are ways to get them to agree to work together. One of the best is organize an emergency fire brigade. Out in the country it can be fifteen to twenty minutes until the fire trucks can get to you best case scenario. A fire on one property can spread in that time from one property to several. Once you get people used to the idea of working together rather then one family working and everyone else standing around it can transition very quickly into a community defense group.



To: akalinin

Whether in big city or suburb, all types of demonstrations are just a very small percentage of the population. That is true of both violent and non-violent demonstrations. Million Man marches rarely have even 100,000 marchers. After MLK was assassinated there were a lot of fires on the West side of Chicago. Most of those fires were set by members of Axelrod’s political organization to collect insurance and to get out of the neighborhood their parents grew up in. Most of those fires were not set by “angry Black rioters”. I know. I was the insurance investigator on the street during the riots and afterward. There were Black rioters. But they were very few. Of course, there are also the professional rioters, the Al Sharpton wannabes who go from fire to fire. They are skilled at getting infront of the TV camera so it seems like a lot of people when it isn’t. Most Blacks do not burn down their own neighborhood.

The body count will be so great the media will have to cover it may well be part of it. may well be part of it. Theoretically, of course.

I was there on the West Side of Chicago in ‘68. The fires were widespread, looting was rampant, and the rioters were many. Many.



To: Da Coyote

Shooting rioters and looters is the way to prevent future riots. Even the belief that you’ll not tolerate rioters and looters helps to prevent them. Just as tolerating rioters and looters, even protecting them from law enforcement after the rioting is done, is the way to insure you suffer riot after riot in endless succession Occasionally some anarchists or bloke who thinks it horrible that I say rioters and looters should be shot by those whose lives, persons, or property they threaten will bluster how those defending themselves will be outnumbered; but, when they do so they neglect the utter lack of discipline or tactical awareness that are two big the things that separates mere rioters from an uprising like with the Battle of Athens (which was NOT menacing any private citizen’s life or propery, and didn’t even seek to harm the homes or other property of the Sheriff and deputies in question). No, rioters and looters have all the soldierly discipline of herded cats. So, you can prevail with much inferior numbers so long as you’ve got resolve and especially if you are loaded for bear. The survivors won’t become emboldened to fight back but will scurry for cover.

http://nypost.com/2016/08/21/american-journalism-is-collapsing-before-our-eyes/ Donald Trump may or may not fix his campaign, and Hillary Clinton may or may not become the first female president. But something else happening before our eyes is almost as important: the complete collapse of American journalism as we know it. The frenzy to bury Trump is not limited to the Clinton campaign and the Obama White House. They are working hand-in-hand with what was considered the cream of the nations news organizations. The shameful display of naked partisanship by the elite media is unlike anything seen in modern America. The largest broadcast networks  CBS, NBC and ABC  and major newspapers like The New York Times and Washington Post have jettisoned all pretense of fair play. Their fierce determination to keep Trump out of the Oval Office has no precedent. ... Indeed, no foreign enemy, no terror group, no native criminal gang, suffers the daily beating that Trump does. The mad mullahs of Iran, who call America the Great Satan and vow to wipe Israel off the map, are treated gently by comparison. More at link...

I had a car that it would have been a thousand miles but decide to go with more conservative number. :)

Will be war in many places outside the cities. They best choose liberal areas outside the cities to attack. No where in Texas.



To: Rurudyne

Even four hundred miles 50 years ago would be next to impossible. People don't realize how much territory you can cover in a car with two tanks of gas. A far more reasonable number would be a half tank of gas.

Ruy Dias de Bivar :" When rioters burn down their own neighborhood, who cares!When they drive to the suburbs and start to burn down other peoples homes who have a vested interest in those homesthe homeowner may FIGHT to prevent his investment being burned." That quite true !

When folks in the inner-city get used to having things given to them , they have no appreciation of the work / value of thise items. they will be met with resitance and HOME OWNERS WILL FIGHT.

Arson is one of those crimes that justifies extreme physical reistance, .. even deadly physical force !

That is an amazingly good idea. It’s probably no help for whoever lives near to the fire hall, but almost everyone else in a rural county would benefit from it.

Short version: In Rwanda, the Tutsis and Hutus hated each other. One day, radio stations announced it was time for Hutus to kill Tutsis. Within days, a million were dead, mostly hacked to death with machetes.

Except Houston, Austin, etc. Downtown Houston and Austin- sure. Have at it. Burn down your own sh*t and kill your own kind. Texas "suburbia"? Go ahead, make our day. Any feral attempting to burn sh*t down in the outlying bedroom communities of either city will pay a dear price. Gun shows and range time are a major form of serious entertainment out here in Texas urban fringe land. We generally don't wait on cops to protect us. Cops are considered after the fact note takers here.

Yes, I live five miles from a small country town in Maryland where a campus of the Maryland University system is located. Just in the last three years we have seen an exponential growth of Sec. 8 people moving into the area and a steadily rising rate of criminal activity. The welfare system enables these people to move, or to be moved, to virtually anywhere in the country. So now you see them, bare asses hanging out, schlepping around the malls and shopping centers, WAITING AND WATCHING - FOR WHAT? one wonders. I anticipate that these people will soon be followed by masses of Muslims into areas such as this, with no jobs, on welfare, just WAITING AND WATCHING. Meanwhile longtime residents with deep roots here are also waiting and watching - and most of them who I know are also locked and loaded.



To: Pollster1

Just point out that the fire trucks can only be in one place at a time. It doesn't matter if you are next to the hall if all the truck are across the county.
