Residents of Garissa Town were on Monday night February 22, 2016 gripped in panic as heavy gunshot sounds filled the area.

It was reported that gunfire could be heard originating from the Kenya Defense Forces (KDF) army barracks in the area a little past 9pm.

Town dwellers hid in fear in their houses, as others, particularly those staying at Bula Mzuri area, fled their homes dreading a terror attack.

The loud firing is said to have been systematic and lasted for a while, before going silent about 30 minutes later.

A Garissa-based photojournalist Hussein Moulid informed Tuko.co.ke newsdesk that security agents who then started patrolling the town assured residents that there was no cause for alarm.

North Eastern regional coordinator Mohamed Saleh told The Standard that faulty performance of power cables near the army base caused an explosion, and the soldiers thought they had been ambushed, hence reacted by firing gunshots.

No casualties were reported.

Garissa County in northeastern Kenya bordering Somalia, has been one of the hotspots of terror attacks in the country, recording one among the deadliest of attacks in April 2015 when at least 147 university students were massacred by al-Shabaab militants in the town.
