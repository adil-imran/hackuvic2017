No Sanctuary Cities, No Muslim Immigration

FR | 10/16/16 | Self (chat)

Posted on by ifinnegan

No more illegal alien crime.

No sanctuary cities.

No more murders and rapes and crime from people who should not even be here.

No more liberal mayors and councils protecting criminals who have been deported over and over and come back.

No ISIS in US.

No more massacres in San Bernadino by Muslims who were welcomed with open arms and love by their co-workers only to be massacred.

No more massacres in Orlando in nightclubs by fake American ISIS supporter with Taliban supporting father.

No more Jihad in USA - Do Not. Let them in to murder us later

These are winning issues.

Wikileaks on horrors of Germany from migrants: Multikultistan: A house of horrors for ordinary Germans Groups of heavily armed young Turks and Arabs routinely beat white youngsters into pulp, especially their faces and teeth, while filming the whole episode for distribution among their mates.

Totally agree. Those who let them in should also be held criminally accountable for the crimes of those they let in.

we either deport/repatriate the Moslems or else we will all wind up having to defend ourselves in streets like many citizens now have to in Europe and elsewhere Moslem “immigration” is DANGEROUS for us all! This is EXACTLY how they invaded and took over 56 other countries already! airlift them all back to their homes in Krapistan, ASAP!

>These are winning issues.< .

America is not interested in winning issues — that’s why they elected OBama TWICE, even though his legacy will be that of the worst president in the nation’s history.

If there is ONE homeless human in America, ONE hungry person, ONE un-educated child, ONE sick and without insurance, ONE American in ANY kind of need whatsoever .... THERE IS NO ROOM FOR A PERSON FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY COMING HERE ! We take care of our own here and now before we take in one more Italian, Frenchman, German, islamist, African, Russian, Irishman etc., etc., etc. !

> Moslem immigration is DANGEROUS for us all! This is EXACTLY how they invaded and took over 56 other countries already! I know this isn't PC but our own Muslim traitors within the government who organized this invasion has just about forced us to line up at the borders to repel the invasion with whatever force is necessary to defend ourselves. And the bad part is its because we know what their end goal is.

...and don’t forget ...”No more Sanctuary counties”

The RUSSIAN military might tried and failed to drive the “WEST” out of Berlin in 1948, foiled by the courage of Harry Truman and the U.S. military.

In 2016, Berliners are being forced out of Berlin by an invasion of so-called REFUGEES, each invited by the German government. That same government lacks the courage and will to defend their own people. Even the police are not allowed to do anything to prevent the ongoing atrocities.

The suffering of Berliners is a self-inflicted horror.

Also, those in the rest of Europe. They are receiving exactly what they proudly asked for.

No muslims, period. There is no place in a free society for them

To: jsanders2001

border defense is one thing

BUT

we need them rounded up and repatriated FROM INSIDE USA.

They’re already INSIDE our country, communities border defense will be good and necessary but NOT ENOUGH, the enemy is already inside our tent (so to speak)...and needs to be sent home ASAP!

You’re right. But when Trump made the very mild statement that we should halt Muslim immigration just temporarily until we know what’s going on, everybody just about lost their minds. Lots of great suggestions on this thread, but it seems impossible that they will ever actually occur in today’s world. The hysterical screams of “Islamophobia!” will drown out any reasonable suggestions, until it is way too late to solve the problem.
