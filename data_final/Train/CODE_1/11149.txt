An outspoken professor from Florida, who publicly purported the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut was a staged event, is now out of a job.

FOX’s Eben Brown reports from Miami:

Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton has officially terminated tenured professor James Tracy, most notorious for online writings claiming the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, and perhaps other massacres, were phony events staged by the government, using actors depicting grieving family.

His termination, however, is related to non-compliance of disciplinary procedures, says the university. Tracy, who holds a Ph.D. has been accused of harassing parents of Sandy Hook victim Noah Pozner, demanding proof the couple’s son ever existed.
