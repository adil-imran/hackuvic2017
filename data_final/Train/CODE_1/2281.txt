The first five months of 2016 has continued to register a growing trend of pickpocketing reports as January-May of this year saw a total of 776 police reports.

This shows an increase of 168 police reports when compared with the same period of 2015. A surge in pickpocketing made headlines in April of this year after a crime report showed a surge in the crime. Between the years 2014 and 2015 reported pickpocketing was up by 492 offences, an increase of 32 per cent.

When looking at the trend between the years 2009 and 2015, reported pickpocketing shot up from 450 to 2030 reports respectively.

When comparing January to May of 2015 and 2016, only February and May saw a decline of pickpocket reports: February 67 reports (2015) and 65 reports (2016), May 295 reports (2015) and 242 reports (2016).

The remainder months all registered increases, some slight and others more drastic: January 43 reports (2015) and 83 reports (2016), March 86 reports (2015) and 125 reports (2016) and April 117 reports (2015) and 261 reports (2016).

The largest spikes can be seen in January, where pickpocket reports almost double, and in April. In line with previous trends, the most affected area between January and June 2016 are those typically frequented by tourists: St Julian’s (324 reports), Sliema (199 reports), Valletta (84 reports) and St Paul’s Bay (28 reports).

As the island’s population spikes in the summer months, mainly between June and August, it can be expected that these numbers continue to rise.

In one of many court cases due to pickpocketing which took place earlier this year, two Romanians were remanded in custody and charged with stealing from a woman at the Qormi flea market.

In the case, prosecuting officer Roderick Agius noted how one of the accused is a typical example of the type of people who commit such a crime, those that are unemployed, have no fixed address and therefore have no way of sustaining themselves. This, he said, makes a person more likely to go on committing such a crime.

At a press conference earlier this year, Assistant Police Commissioner Neville Aquilina confirmed that the spike in pickpocketing during 2015 was linked with a spate of incidents involving an organised gang from Eastern European countries.

He had said that reports of this type of crime started to decrease when the culprits where charged in court. Figures from the first five months of 2016 however, show that while this may be the case for the months of January and February 2016, pickpocket reports continued to climb between March and May.

Local media reports show that a significant portion of individuals arraigned in court over pickpocketing tend to come from Eastern European countries such as Romania and Bulgaria. Reports and statistics also show that the bulk of such crimes happen mostly in summer.

Other crime: vandalism

Summer months are not only known for a surge in pickpocketing, Sliema residents have taken to social media to express their frustration at being victims of car vandalism.

Frustrated residents took to social media, calling on authorities to take action against the vandals.

One resident who spoke with the Times of Malta said how he recently woke up to find his car mirror badly damaged. He said that this is not the first incident which took place, adding that some time ago a person had caught one of the vandals in the act.

He also said that a group of young students residing in Don Rua Street, Sliema, had recently committed a string of vandalism acts in the early hours of the morning – damaging roughly five cars.

Last summer also saw a surge of reports by Swieqi residents who complained of acts of vandalism against their vehicles, as well as loud and disruptive behaviour in the early hours of the morning.

Last month, 40 tourism police officers completed their specialised training and were deployed to Sliema and St Julian’s, two areas most affected by such crimes. They have the same powers and responsibilities of any policemen, and are also responsible for keeping an eye out on tourism-related offences, as well as informing them of their rights as tourists.
