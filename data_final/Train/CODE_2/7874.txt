Obama administration kills ITT Tech, stranding 40,000 students and destroying 8,000 jobs

Tyrants throughout history have known that beheading their enemies and placing the heads on pikes at the gates of their capitals sends a powerful message to everyone else. Behave yourself as we dictate, and you may survive. Cross the king, and you are a dead man.

Something very similar, but updated and taken to a vast financial level, happened to ITT Tech, the privately owned trade school/university. As the Wall Street Journal explains, it crossed the king (in this case, the Obama Department of Education):

ITT Technical Institute folded on cue Tuesday after the Obama Administration issued a regulatory death warrant last month. ITT investors must be wishing they had ponied up for political protection like Laureate International Universities, the for-profit college that paid Bill Clinton $17.6 million to serve as its honorary chancellor.

ITTs decision to close all of its 130 some campusesstranding 40,000 students and 8,000 employeescomes after the Education Department barred new enrollees from tapping federal aid, delayed loan reimbursements and raised its collateral by $153 million. ITT had a mere $78 million on hand at the end of June and no way of meeting the Administrations cash demand.

What difference, at this point, does it make?

The Mudslime-In-Chief killed 8,000 jobs. On the bright side, I'll bet a majority of the 8,000 employees and 40,000 students will be voting TRUMP!

Seems the citizens should hold our tax-payer funded government to a much higher and more penalized standard.

Don’t count on it. The Dems will tell the students that Trump and the republicans are responsible.



To: MtnClimber

Bttt.



To: Paladin2

ITT Tech must not brainwash its students with politically correct liberal horse-$hit. It they pushed white privilege and other stupid liberal nonsense they would still be in business.

They actually taught things that were useful. Not much politics to Fuel Injector “Studies”



To: MtnClimber

Indications are that this is the extraordinarily rare instance where the Obama Administration may have done something right. The organization seems to have primarily excelled at creating lots of student loan debt, and failed miserably at providing useful education.

Anybody in the San Diego area can check with KUSI TV, they did a story on the local ITT schools, and I learned that another local school is honoring the classes, and will help the students get the courses they need and they can still graduate .. and the school will also help them seek a job. Let anybody you know who got caught in Obama’s tantrum realize that there is some help out there.

A few months ago Obama did this to Heald College as well, right before graduation and many students here got screwed out of their tuition and diplomas. And the reason Heald got shut down had nothing to do with financial soundness, etc. The Department of Education made the decision it was not engaging in enough outreach to potential employers, and thus somehow was evil and had to be shut down.



To: MtnClimber

ITT has the option to stay open, as all they would need to do is exted Student Loans to they own students and liberate their students from being in debt to the federal government. It seems odd that ITT would not simply loan money to their students.

The organization seems to have primarily excelled at creating lots of student loan debt, and failed miserably at providing useful education. Perhaps, but competition in this sector would put them out of business if they failed to deliver. Maybe they were trying to cash in on the travesty of public school debt. Who knows how much a degree in women's studies will set a student back at Harvard.

I’m no big fan of these vastly overpriced tech schools, but at least they do teach people marketable skills,... produce people who can actually do something useful.... unlike the well accredited colleges and universities with their “Liberal Arts” degrees. Damn Feds once again stick their noses into things that is the province of the individual states.



To: MtnClimber

Obama, Hillary and the Democrat Party do not want the poor to be employed, so they shut down these centers that can teach them a skill. Of course, there is a high failure rate because the students have come from our very poor government schools and can’t read or write, or they are illegal aliens who are virtually illiterate.

But Obama thinks ITT should have the same failure rate as Haaaavahd. Too bad for those who were trying to better their lot in life. The Democrats won’t allow it.



To: Timpanagos1

Stop ALL gubmint money to ALL propaganda institution, which includes ALL publik universities. If it is useful, the market will self guide.



To: txrefugee

“But Obama thinks ITT should have the same failure rate as Haaaavahd. Too bad for those who were trying to better their lot in life. The Democrats wont allow it.” “Haaavahd” has $100 billion in private endowments. ITTT has ZERO, thus it is entirely a parasitic entity surviving off the gubmint.



To: FreedomPoster

I think the 18 Trillion US debt should be taken from government worker pensions. They were responsible for running it up instead of paying it off.

I have known several fellows who went through the ITT courses and have nothing but good things to say about it. They went straight from it to employment.

There must not be much to the Trump U “scandal” because the left is only using it very half heartedly and just throw it up occasionally but won’t talk about it.

Kinda reminds me of the Chrysler dealerships. Doing what he does best. Picking losers and destroying winners.

They even have a wiki entry ITT Tech is owned and was operated by ITT Educational Services, Inc. (NYSE: ESI), a publicly traded company headquartered in Carmel, Indiana. The company also owns and operates Breckinridge School of Nursing and Health Sciences schools. ITT Technical Institute charged among the highest tuition fees in the industry. It also had the industry’s highest rate of loans that go into default within two years of attendance. **In 2014, the tuition for attending an ITT Tech campus ranged from $45,000 to $85,000.** A group of more than 2000 students and former students called the ITT Tech Warriors have protested that they received a subprime education. According to one source, early career pay for associate degree graduates of ITT Tech’s Seattle campus in 2015 was $42,400, while mid-career pay was $66,500. As of September 2016, College Scorecard reported that graduates of ITT Tech schools nationally earned an average income of $38,400, measured at ten years after graduation.

ITT hands out grades based on race, it does not actually prepare the student for the work force. They haven’t been able to find my son’s attendance or grades records, yet he’s still billed for student loan. Their Electronic course.
