APNewsBreak: UN criticism of Trump prompts Russian response

Yahoo News ^ | 7 Oct 2016

Posted on by mandaladon

GENEVA (AP)  Diplomats tell The Associated Press that Russia's government lodged a formal complaint last month with the United Nations over a top U.N. official's condemnations of Donald Trump and some European politicians.

The intervention underscores the unusual links between the Kremlin and the Republican presidential nominee.

There is no evidence Trump sought Russia's assistance, or was even aware of the criticism by Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights.

But three diplomats say the criticism prompted Vitaly Churkin, Russia's U.N. ambassador, to issue a verbal "demarche" to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a private meeting on Sept. 13.

The diplomats weren't authorized to speak publicly about the matter and demanded anonymity, fearing possible diplomatic repercussions from Russia, a powerful, permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.

You’re not helping, Russia.



To: mandaladon

Exactly how has Trump mistreated or did ANYTHING that would warrant anyone associated with U.N. Human Rights to make a condemnation?!? This is the STUPIDITY that oozes throughout the walls of the U.N.!! If someone wanted to blow that building off the map, I would encourage them!!! Waste of space, time, effort, and energy...the whole damn thing!!!

notice how the story fails to name the “other European politicians” who were criticized?? either a fake story or potentially allies of clinton...



To: dfwgator

No, but I do see why the Russians prefer Trump. Russia wins the Syrian Civil War with a Trump Presidency.

My thanks to Putin for elevating this UN obscenity into the public view, now I hope he completes the job and hacks Trump into the presidency. If the Ds can stuff the ballot box with impunity, the Russians should be afforded equal access to our election process.

The UN had no basis to criticize Trump as they did, it was a blatant attempt to interfere in the election.



To: dfwgator

Russia wants Hillary to win So they are going to publically support Trump Putin is not stupid, he knows how to play this game



To: mandaladon; MeganC

Call me Crazy, But I think this is a Russian Crazy Ivan Move. Trump = Strong America. Which Means Russia can do what they like, so they will try and stop Trump form being elected by subtly trying to undermined him by denying he is in league with them, which gives Clinton Ammunition to say he is.

Youre not helping, Russia. Why should they? They probably want 8 more years of feckless American leadership. Remember, we're more "flexible" now.

The MSM knows about this because the Clinton campaign is busy manufacturing this myth about “Russian interference in the US Elections” since it gives the MSM an excuse to talk about something other then the daily evidence of Clinton;s corruption and incompetence

The little bastard hadn’t done anything remotely worthy of a Nobel Prize before getting it, and has PROVEN to be a worthless P.O.S. everyday since getting the B.S. award!

To: dfwgator

This action is almost a campaign plug for Hillary. That’s who they want because they know she is spineless and is philosophically closer to communism than free-market capitalism.



To: RegulatorCountry

The UN is afraid of him. Trump won’t allow their dream of control of the US.

To: dfwgator

I think Russia, Hillary, and Obama are working together. Hillary campaign has been way too loose blaming Russia for everything from Hacking to loving Trump. They have a deal with Hillary who helped them obtain 20% of US uranium and will probably have a lot more goodies for them when Hillary is President.



To: henkster

Let ‘em!!! Obama has chosen the WRONG SIDE of every faction in the Middle East - PERIOD!!! He chose to kill Ghadaffi, the Egyptian leader, Nuclear arm Iran, ISIS (against Syria), etc... At this point, we need to get out of that mess and let it take it’s course!!! The King of Jordan put it best...we are in the Third World War! And right now, we are supporting the Axis in this battle!!!

The intervention underscores the unusual and traitorous ties Canckles and her corrupt cohorts in both the Dhimmicrats and Global Rino parties have with the UN.



To: KC_Lion

I don’t see it that way. Russia knows a weak USA leaves a vacuum that the islamo-fascists will fill. He also see’s hilLIARy as a muzzie enabler almost as bad as Obama. He is FIGHTING the muzzie brotherhood in Syria on the side of Assad. He sees Odumbshit hellping the MB side. He knows hilLIARy will continue to help the muzzies, as well as being stupider than stupid can be, and a liar and cheat. He knows Trump would be a stronger leader. Maybe even one he can deal with and become actual friends with. It would be nice not to be an enemy with Russia forever.



To: Sans-Culotte

Youre not helping, Russia. Why should they? They probably want 8 more years of feckless American leadership. Remember, we're more "flexible" now. I have a friend who works in Russia that often translates and sends me things he sees in the Russian press about the election. The Russian's have absolutely zero respect for Hillary and they mocks and belittle her daily. A popular cartoon portrays her as a befuddled old bag lady. She is commonly referred to as "Obama's Старый пес" which is Russian slang for an "old whore".

“What unusual links????” The ones we, the Leftist Mainstream Media, make up. Outside of arresting the Media and having them shot, I don’t know what else we can do to defeat them.

The same lack of anything but perception that got Obama a Nobel Prize for simply not being President George Bush.



To: mandaladon

“criticism by Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights.” This is rich coming from a Jordanian Arab. This POS needs to turn his criticism towards his Arab Muslim fascist brothers who delight in Sharia as their tool of oppression. But that’s asking too much from another Islamic fool.



To: dfwgator

Russia is just stepping in where the USA is not doing its job. The UN is supposed to be nonpolitical. Putin knows he will be next on the UN list if he doesn't stop it now.

The Russians apparently learned something from the long folly of a stream of corrupt communist regimes that brought them to their knees. Their leadership is willing to take a chance on an outsider to lead our country because the sooner we return to sanity the better it will be for the entire world.

Personally, I found it much more disturbing that our own Dear Leader criticized Trump at the UN meetings in NY a couple weeks ago. How dare he criticize - and undermine - someone that could be our next President? Traitorous.

Why isn’t the story the Clinton connection to the corrupt UN and why the UN is messing in our national election?



To: KC_Lion

Trump = Strong America. So Putin knows that Trump will put America first just like he puts Russia first. Therein they have an implicit understanding and can predict each others actions. With a dem in the white house there is no implicit understanding and no way to anticipate future US actions. Dems do not put American interest first and frequently take actions directly against Americas best interest. Dems and the EU (and sadly most of the GOPe) put the interest of the globalists/imperialist new world order a head of any and all nation states. Russia wants no part of that BS. Because the dems follow ideologies and feelings, global warming, skittles, unicorns and social justice ect. They make fundamental mistakes because their thought processed are not basted on fact, reason or reality. This leads to severe problems for the rest of the world including Russia. Russia would much rather deal with a strong predictable America serving it's own interest than another dem president who wields Americas power like a toddle who found his fathers loaded gun. Putin exactly knows what he will get with Trump but there is no telling what the next stupid thing Hillary will come up with. She is unstable, unpredictable and based on her past performance a menace to the world.
