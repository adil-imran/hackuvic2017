New York, Colorado and the District of Columbia may soon join the handful of states where doctors are allowed to help terminally ill patients die by prescribing a lethal dose of painkillers.

A proposal to allow physician-assisted dying will be on the ballot in Colorado next month. In the District of Columbia, the District Council’s Health and Human Services Committee last week approved a physician-assisted dying bill that the full council could vote on before the end of the year. New York lawmakers, meanwhile, are hopeful that support in the Legislature for aid-in-dying bills will soon overcome opposition from religious leaders and some medical groups.

Victories in the three jurisdictions would galvanize a movement that seeks to give terminally ill Americans a dignified alternative to the dismal choices they face in most of the country. In states where assisted dying is banned, some terminal patients manage to get a lethal dose of drugs from medical professionals under the table, which exposes the health care workers to prosecution. Others are advised to starve themselves to death.

Doctors are allowed to help terminally ill patients die in Oregon, Washington, Vermont, California and Montana under strict guidelines. Two physicians must concur that the patient is likely to die within six months. Doctors must ensure that patients making the request are of sound mind and that they are not being coerced. In four of the states that allow it, a request for a lethal dose of painkillers must be reiterated 15 days after it was originally made in order for the drugs to be prescribed.

Some medical groups, including the Medical Society of the State of New York, oppose physician-assisted dying. “Although relief of suffering has always been a fundamental duty in medical practice, relief of suffering through shortening of life has not,” the group says in its position statement. “Moreover, the social and societal implications of such a fundamental change cannot be fully contemplated.”

In fact, terminal patients in excruciating pain and their relatives contemplate those implications every day around the country. There is no compelling reason to deprive them of physician-assisted dying as one option alongside high-quality, innovative palliative care.

A New York assemblywoman, Amy Paulin, agreed last year to introduce an aid-in-dying bill after meeting with a constituent and a lobbyist who made a persuasive case. Within months, the issue became personal as her sister, who lived in Georgia, was told she would soon die from ovarian cancer. “The pain was unbelievable,” Ms. Paulin said, describing her sister’s final days. “She would be crying in agony.”

If her sister had lived in a state where requesting a lethal dose of medicine was legal, Ms. Paulin said, she may have been spared days of misery. Relatives could have gathered to say goodbye before she took the pills.

“It would have been a much better ending to losing your sister,” she said. “We could have all been there. We could have held her hand.”
