LUDHIANA: Ludhianvis won't see the usual 10-headed Ravan during Dussehra celebrations at several parts of city.With passions running high against Pakistan following Uri terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir, which claimed the lives of 18 Indian soldiers, the Azaad Dussehra Committee , Millerganj, has decided to burn the effigy of Pakistan prime minister Nawaz Sharif and 26/11 mastermind Hafiz Saeed in place of demon king Ravan and his son Meghnaad, respectively.Moreover, the All Parents Association, Ludhiana, will celebrate Dussehra by burning the effigy of 'school mafia' in place of Ravan.Explaining why they chose Pakistan PM as Ravan and Hafiz as Meghnaad, members of Azaad Dussehra Committee said this festival celebrates the victory of good over evil and this time Pakistan has committed a lot of evil activities at the border.They said that India had tried its best to strengthen the bonds between the two countries, but Pakistan has backstabbed India every time causing damage to the country, its people and the armed forces. There is lot of anger among the residents and Pakistan should stop encouraging terrorism.Committee president Parminder Singh said the recent Uri attack has shaken the whole country and that too when Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made all efforts to create a friendly environment. They are celebrating Dussehra for the past 42 years.He said surgical strikes by the Army at terror camps across the Line of Control were a befitting reply. He said everybody knows about Hafiz Saeed and how he is trying to create disturbance in India. "So we will burn his effigy too this time," he said.Committee chairman Kuldeep Sharma said they would also pay tributes to soldiers who gave up their lives at the borders to save the country from the evil and will also raise tricolor during the celebrations.Meanwhile, the effigy created by All Parents Association, Ludhiana, has posters of 'School Mafai' as the main head of Ravan and nine heads depicting different schools.Parents will gather at Bharat Nagar Chowk at 11am to burn the effigy. The idea was floated by a parent during a meeting of All Parents Association comprising parents of students studying in different schools.According to parents, schools have been harassing children and parents by adopting different means.Inderpal Singh Chawla, a parent, said, "Dussehra festival depicts the victory of good over evil. Be it unjustified fee hike, building funds and other charges, commercial activities or misbehaving with children -- schools are harassing us in different ways."It may be recalled here that, this year the new academic session of schools started with long and continues protest by parent of different schools. To resolve things, the district admonition had to intervene and a separate committee was constituted for the same."Although protests have stopped, but our fight is going on against the school. Education builds future and with the commercialization of education, schools have become money making institutes. Besides, schools are also violating many rules and harassing parents," said Sandeep Singh , a parent, who suggested the idea.Viewing the support of China to Pakistan, there is strong wave on social media against using Chinese goods and crackers during Diwali celebrations this year. People are sharing pictures, personal messages to urge people not to buy Chinese goods in order to his the economy of China.
