The Religious Right Begins to Flex its Muscles in Secular Mexico

The Washington Post ^ | 10/8/16 | David Agren

MEXICO CITY  Conservatives from all corners of the country converged on Mexico City on a recent Saturday for the National March for the Family, which took aim at the presidents plans to enshrine same-sex marriage in the constitution.

The LGBT community and its allies launched a counterprotest, waving rainbow flags and carrying pictures of former presidents Benito Juárez and Plutarco Elías Calles  lionized as heroes of the secular state, figures who curbed Catholic Church privileges in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

These contradictory images symbolize a growing conflict in this nation, where the church has been relegated to the sidelines of public life for decades. Now the religious right is rising as a political force, with conservative Catholics and members of the growing evangelical community attempting to influence the National Congress and mobilize the masses.

This is a clash between the secular state and the sectors that dont accept the secular state, said Ilán Semo, historian at the Jesuit-run Ibero-American University in Mexico City.

The modern Mexican state was created by revolutionaries at odds with the Catholic Church, and they sought to curb its authority through measures such as introducing a secular school system. For decades, Mexico was considered the most anticlerical country in Latin America outside of Cuba, despite the fact that the country is overwhelmingly Catholic. Census data shows that 83 percent profess the faith.

But politicians have punted the old protocols over the past 25 years as they have sought the blessing of bishops, appeared publicly with prelates and kissed the popes ring  unthinkable a generation ago.

The use of religious symbolism is increasing: Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a leftist who is among the front-runners for the 2018 presidential election, christened his new party with the acronym MORENA  also a name for.....

LOL....for the record, the Mexican government confiscated all Church property, including hospitals, monasteries, convents, and schools. Priests were forbidden to wear clerical dress in public. They were not allowed to express opinions on politics, even in private conversation. They could not seek justice in the Mexican courts. To take a religious vow became a criminal act. All foreign clergy were deported. I guess that falls under the general heading of "curbing Catholic Church privileges".

Shows what an alternative reality the Ministry of Propaganda inhabits.

Mexico is one of the most devoutly Catholic countries in the world

The modern Mexican state was created by revolutionaries at odds with the Catholic Church, And those "revolutionaries" also turned Mexico into the statist, corrupt, socialist basket-case it was for most of the 20th century.

Unbelievable that they would hoist the picture of that disgraziato.

pictures of former presidents Benito Juárez and Plutarco Elías Calles ... Calles tried to eradicate the Catholic Church in the 1920s with military force. Read about the "Cristero War" on Wikipdeia. These counter-protestors adore Calles.

To understand Mexican politics, see the DVD For Greater Glory with Andy Garcia, Eva Longoria. Recently PAN pushed for the right to bear arms in Mexico, a right lost as shown in For Greater Glory. PAN is the Republican Party of Mexico and had 2 of the last 3 presidents. Fox leaned libertarian Republican. Calderon went social conservative, think Santorum. Current PRI president, who met Trump, is a corrupt opportunist, think Clinton, or Chicago style Democrats. Playing the PAN card was significant in my success with American voters of Mexican heritage. Even when the don’t know their history or political theory, their culture defines them to a large degree.
