The House of Representatives yesterday suspended its former chairman of the Appropriation Committee, Abdulmumin Jibrin, for one year over breaches of privileges of the 360 members of the House.

The decision was taken after the adoption of the report of the Ethics and Privileges Committee which probed the matter between Wednesday last week and Tuesday this week.

The committee headed by Rep Ossai Nicholas Ossai (PDP, Delta) made four recommendations to the House, one of which was that Jibrin be reprimanded and suspended for 180 legislative sitting days in the first instance in line with Chapter 9 (1) of the Code of Conduct for members of the House.The panel recommended further Jibrin was required to tender a formal written apology to the House, prior to his future resumption of duties.The panel also recommended that the House should further regulate its procedures. All the recommendations contained in the nine-page report were adopted by the over 200 lawmakers present at plenary, with no dissenting voice.Our correspondent reports that 180 legislative sitting days amount to a period of one year as the House only conducts plenary sessions three days a week, from Tuesday to Thursday.With the suspension, Jibrin will not be able to attend any plenary or committee session and will lose all his entitlements as a lawmaker, including salaries and allowances, among others.Also, all the five legislative aides attached to him will lose their entitlements during the period, while his Kiru/Bebeji Federal Constituency of Kano State will not have any representation in the House as the suspension lasts.In his reaction, Jibrin told journalists that he would never apologise to anybody in the House because he believed he was right.“The most important thing is that Nigerians saw the entire process: how the motion was passed, what transpired at the level of the ethics committee and entirely the process was flawed. For me, it’s a non-issue and complete nonsense and it is not going to stand anywhere in the world.“As you are aware, the matter is a subject of litigation. I have instructed my lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), to file charges of contempt against Speaker Dogara and of course the House of Representatives. I’m sure the matter will move over to the judiciary and decision will be taken. I’m pretty sure it will be in my favour”. He gave his colleagues in the House 72 hours to declare their running costs or face legal action.
