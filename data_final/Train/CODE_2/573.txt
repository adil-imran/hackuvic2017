Alleged Guccifer 2.0 hack of Clinton Foundation raises suspicions

thehill.com ^ | 10/4/16 | Katie Bo Williams

Posted on by ColdOne

A new posting from the hacker alias Guccifer 2.0 purported to be documents stolen from the Clinton Foundation appears to be a hoax.

ADVERTISEMENT

Guccifer 2.0  believed to be a misinformation campaign operated by Russian intelligence  posted an 860-megabyte file on Tuesday afternoon that he claimed was donor information he hacked from Clinton Foundation servers.

A sampling of the posted documents include a spreadsheet of big bank donations, a list of primarily California donors, an outdated spreadsheet of some Republican House members  and a screenshot of files he claimed to have obtained, one of which was titled Pay to Play.

I am trying to think in the last 25 years when has a Clinton told the truth? Yeah............never. Heck even if this isn't real, best election EVAH!



To: ColdOne

I agree, best election ever. Maybe instead of a vote, the deciding event should be a duel between the two candidates, broadcast live on pay-per-view.

What we have seen so far, while interesting, seems totally unrelated to the Clinton Foundation. Much of it is probably available in the public records - TARP funding recipients and amounts for example. And corporate contributions to Congressmen. I’ll start to buy in when we see some damaging info on the Foundation itself. So far I don’t think we have. But looking for it should be the focus of the document dump review.

Right, RatherGate was totally true but none of Guccifer 2.0 is. Yeah. /S

First, an inspection of the individual documents is warranted. If any of them were prepared by someone who was not an American with an American vocabulary and understanding of English usage, it should be quite evident. We have all seen Help screens and user documents which were obviously written by someone other than a native American speaker. Such a test would not conclusively prove their validity, but it could certainly disprove them. Second, perhaps, even if the documents are not genuine, we should dredge up the phrases used in the Dan Rather defense. He tried to establish the benchmark that genuineness was not as important as conveying someone’s notion of the truth.

Do we know what this list is? Big Dem Donors? Big Clinton Donors? Big Foundation Donors?

HRC press conference right now. A female reporter asked her about Assange and the info he was going to release and did she really say to someone, “Can’t we just drone the guy?” She looked down during the entire question and then answered that she knew nothing about it. I DESPISE THIS WOMAN.



To: ColdOne

So if the documents really belong to the Democratic Committee then it’s OK that donations to democrats from big banks are tied to TARP?



To: ColdOne

Not a hoax. All of the email addresses and phone numbers are authentic.



To: Former Proud Canadian

I read it that they are actually from the Democrat committed, not the Clinton foundation as claimed.



To: Former Proud Canadian

So, the spin is going to be that the documents are fake. Who fakes this many documents? Why Donald Trump, of course, who asked Putin to do it. Or so the media and Democrats will insist, perhaps as soon as tonight's VP debate.

Unless she had Ashok from India (nod to Dilbert) make them up. That would be such a hoot if someone like that, KNOWING what Hillary was about and that she never really looked at the system, put Pay to Play in there ON PURPOSE.

I am not sure. They were broadcasting Trump here in AZ and then abruptly cut away to the hag. So I went to a local station to hear Trump because I can only take her for a couple of minutes. I only heard her remark on Assange, Trump and his remark about PTSD and the debate tonight. She looked like hell.

Who did it really does not matter. It’s a minor issue at best. The fact is these criminals have beeen exposed is what matters, but criminals do not like being caught. Globalist idiots keep saying it’s Russia but have no evidence to back up their claim. Even if it was the case so what? What has been exposed is what matters.

The Clintons form a network of unscrupulous political hacks that think they are smarter than everyone else. They are criminally minded persons forming a mafia-esque network. When referring to a Clinton ‘technique’, it means a technique or scheme that is hatched and executed by a member of the Clinton network. A technique used by the Clintons is to soak media with hoaxes in response to a real event that implicates them. Their news members will dominate the news cycle with the hoax work to dilute any news value of a real event. Such a technique is no different than a smokescreen used in a wartime setting or any different from using decoys to confuse adversaries. The Clinton network is good at this and because they are good at this, they tend to think they are smarter than everyone else.

Well, writer Katie doesn’t waste any time stating in the first sentence that it “appears to be a hoax.” No “We’re taking it under advisement, considering Guccifer’s hack of the DNC which resulted in Sgt. `Mayohead’ Schultz’s resignation and much gnashing of `rat teeth.” Looks like Clinton damage control but I’ll take it under advisement until we get more info.

Clinton is best destroyed by herself, her own appearance, her own missteps, her repeatedly calling for issues that are not popular. Her supporters dismiss scandals associated with her as right-wing hate or as unimportant in contrast to negatives of her opponent. Al Franken talks about Trump stiffing his lawyers and his workers as huge negatives about Trump without understanding that tens of millions of Americans do the same when work is shabby or not performed at all per contract. Yet Hillary’s supporters will fight back using Franken’s words. It’s what they do. To win over those sitting on the fence comes down to likeability. And that requires Clinton to be seen and heard. She’s not likeable even with a script. It also requires Trump to ably bypass the media’s landmines to paint him as a bully because that’s what they are waiting for him to step on.

I looked really hard and I did NOT see two of Hillary's biggest sponsors: 1. Muslim Brotherhood and Al Qaeda 2. Iran The terrorists and Iran are pouring money to Hillary because if Trump is elected, he will tear up the agreement with Iran that gives them nuclear weapons AND he will join the Israelis when they destroy the Iranian reactors. The Muslim terrorists are big supporters of Hillary because she is going to continue the Muslim invasion of the US. And of course, Trump would actually use the US military to kill terrorists rather than help them as Hussein Obama has done (America's FIRST Muslim President).

The Russians As most Americans know who have an IQ a bit greater than dirt, it's what is in the emails that is the story, not who hacked them. The Demorats line is to contend it would be unpatriotic and in support of the Russians if you talk about Hillary's pay for play Secretary of State scam. But here is the important point, since this later "story" mentions the Russians, it's a sure bet this is straight from the DNC delivered to all of the presstitutes. And we know from an earler hacked email that the DNC gives some of the presstitutes their marching orders.

Wow. So the writer for ‘The Hill’ jumped right in to mention it could be a hoax without doing any research or fact checking. The Hill is a Beltway brand that follows a moderate path of bias, omitting most findings supporting conservatives but never failing to omit democrat allegations against republicans. They have very little credibility. That said, beware the psyops of the Clinton network dominating the news cycle by throwing out fake stories of scandals about them that are soonafter proven to be false.

The Clintons would. It looks to be a firebreak leak. To counter Wikileaks expected leak, they are flooding the field with false information.
