Confirmed: Rupert Murdoch Instructed Fox News To Take Down Donald Trump August 2015

In an extensive article within New York Magazine, mostly outlining the rather sordid details of Roger Ailes, readers may also note specific confirmation of something we outlined in August of last year (2015). Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch instructed Fox News executives to take down Donald Trump.

(NY MAG) [ ] Murdoch was not a fan of Trumps and especially did not like his stance on immigration. (The antipathy was mutual: Murdochs been very bad to me, Trump told me in March.) A few days before the first GOP debate on Fox in August 2015, Murdoch called Ailes at home. This has gone on long enough, Murdoch said, according to a person briefed on the conversation.

Murdoch told Ailes he wanted Foxs debate moderators  Kelly, Bret Baier, and Chris Wallace  to hammer Trump on a variety of issues. Ailes, understanding the GOP electorate better than most at that point, likely thought it was a bad idea. Donald Trump is going to be the Republican nominee, Ailes told a colleague around this time. But he didnt fight Murdoch on the debate directive.

On the night of August 6, in front of 24 million people, the Fox moderators peppered Trump with harder-hitting questions. But it was Kellys question regarding Trumps history of crude comments about women that created a media sensation. He seemed personally wounded by her suggestion that this spoke to a temperament that might not be suited for the presidency. Ive been very nice to you, though I could probably maybe not be based on the way you have treated me, he said pointedly. (read more)

This is interesting on many levels, but more importantly for a few very specific confirmational aspects.

Last year many people were struggling to understand what was going on within Fox News. Many people saw the bias; even more people grew outraged at what they were witnessing; but unfortunately many people would not (or could not) accept what was brutally obvious.

Additionally, when CTH outlined the specifics of the factional alignment that was coming from this directive, multiple entities within the conservative blog-o-sphere claimed we were advancing some form of ridiculous conspiratorial analysis.

The last third of an earlier CTH outline, during this event timeline (July/August 15), specifically warned Trump in advance of the first debate that Fox News had this intention. (Scroll down to the part of Megyn Kelly HERE).

Additionally, within the cited New York Magazine article youll note that Lachlan Murdoch personally instructed Harper Collins Publications, another Murdoch business, to give Megyn Kelly a $6,000,000 advance on a $10 million book deal. In 2015 when we found out who Kellys publisher was, we presented that specific prediction  again, in the face of much antagonism. However, we were correct.

Why is this confirmation important?

If you go through the timeline, and look at the confirmation in the NY Mag, youll note the specific group within Fox News who formed the internal Pro-Murdoch/Anti-Trump Fox coalition. They are: Bret Baier, Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace.

Not coincidentally these key Fox hosts were the ones specifically directed to take down Trump AND the three anti-Trump amigos on the Fox Debate Panel.

Rubio debate 2

Wallace, Baier, Kelly and (circled) Fox News VP Political Executive Bill Sammon  during debate preparations. Bill Sammon is the father of Marco Rubios National Campaign Spox, Brooke Sammon. Senator Marco Rubio was also the preferred candidate of Rupert Murdoch because of his immigration position.

Secondly, if you think about Baier, Kelly and Wallace beyond the scope of the debate itself, you might also begin to remind yourself and cross reference in your mind which Fox shows consistently highlight (what later became known as) the #NeverTrump punditry.

Thinking specifically about Fox News and Brett Baier, Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace. Now think about which shows give continual voice to: Brit Hume, Stephen Hayes, Charles Krauthammer, Bill Kristol, George Will, Jonah Goldberg, Ben Shapiro, Rich Lowry, Glenn Beck, Dana Loesch, Katie Pavlich, Chris Stirewalt and Guy Benson.

Never trump crowd

What you realize is the 2015 #NeverTrumpers (pictured above) were/are almost exclusively booked for appearances on Ruperts Three Amigos: Bret Baier (Special Report), Megyn Kelly (Kelly File), and Chris Wallace (Fox News Sunday and Special Report).

These three Fox Hosts are the primary voices behind the Rupert Murdoch anti-Trump faction within Fox News. Remember when Donald Trump pulled out of the second Fox News debate:

Megyn Kelly tweet Stirewalt

Another key aspect to keep in mind is that Rupert Murdoch doesnt operate alone. There are other media entities, not as big but still influential, that follow the exact same set of directives. The Salem Media Communications group is one example (Hot Air, Human Events, Twitchy, Red State, Hugh Hewitt et al), and iHeart Radio is another.

Just like Murdoch at Fox News, Salem Media Communications and iHeart Radio hold the same ideological objectives. Every entity within those enterprises is part of the same synergistic networking group. Politically, Club 4 Growth and a host of other PACs and political enterprises are funding mechanisms aligned in ideology and providing financial support to the aforementioned political media sales force.

As more and more people awaken to the reality they become increasingly self-aware. With that awareness comes a realization that conspiracy theories are quite often not just theory.

ps. Do you still think Chris Wallace should moderate the third presidential debate? Knowing full well that the person who determines his income, Rupert Murdoch, has been specifically identified as giving instructions to Chris Wallace to take down Donald Trump?

Not happy about Chris Wallace as debate moderator. He’ll do everything he can to help Hillary. If Gary Johnson were less weird and nerdy, they would make sure the polls showed he was eligible to be on the debate state with 15%.

talk about burying the lede/Lewinsky NY Mag! Still, the whispers about Ailes and women were growing louder. Karem Alsina, a former Fox makeup artist, told me she grew suspicious when Fox anchors came to see her before private meetings with Ailes to have their makeup done. They would say, Im going to see Roger, gotta look beautiful!  she recalled. One of them came back down after a meeting, and the makeup on her nose and chin was gone. In 2012, after I had been reporting my Ailes biography for a year, Megyn Kelly became so concerned about the rumors that she went to Ailess thenPR chief, Brian Lewis, and attempted an intervention, according to a person close to Kelly. She told Lewis that Ailes was being reckless and that I might include his behavior in my book. (I did report the stories of two women who claimed Ailes had harassed them earlier in his career, and though I heard rumors of Ailes and Fox News women, I could not confirm them at the time.) Lewis, according to the source, asked Laterza to tell Ailes to stop because he thought Ailes might listen to his longtime assistant. Instead, according to the source, Laterza told Ailes that his PR chief was being disloyal. Less than a year later, Ailes fired Lewis.

IIRC, Mr. Murdoch has subsequently “tweeted” out some support for Trump’s stands. Let’s not read too much into this—while not ignoring the evidence, too. Remember: the enemy wants to divide us.

For most of us here, we already knew this.

It was an obvious Trump set up.

Starting with the hack debate moderators, to the talking heads afterwards

The Clinton crime foundation needs to be shut down and these Foreign enemy agents like Rupert Murdoch and Soros needs to be ejected or deported to the countries with warrants out for his arrest.

The phony non profits Soros set up need to be shut down too .Fox Globalist News has evolved into a open borders propaganda outfit .

I’ve always “known” it was Murdock behind the anti-Trump effort, not Ailes. And it was transparently clear that someone high-up was calling the shots.

Most of Fox is pure communists garbage. Never watch the Wallace, Kelly and Baier garbage and they spin everything. Wallace is a real insane case. Kelly is beyond hope. But the big O? Most of the time he is crap. Trump for President.

Well, Meg got $6 million advance for her book (which she’s probably paying someone else to write for her) and the others aren’t exactly underpaid. Murdock found their price and now they are doing what he tells them to. Not really unlike any employment situation, just with more zeros on the paycheck. If the boss says to wear a certain kind of shirt or uniform and talk a certain way to customers, that’s what we all do. The Fox hosts just do it with words. If “we” look at any news outlet as “gospel truth” without bias, then who is the dummy? That’s why were were equipped with functional brains that are capable of critical thought. I will say O’Reilly tends to get the best guests, which is why I watch, but now that Eric Bolling has been filling in most of the summer, it’s a much better program. If O’Reilly would take a permanent vacation I bet the ratings would improve, as it’s a good show with an annoying host.

This is a big story actually. Just blasted this out to my nevertrump friends, and ex friends. Most will not accept that they have been duped by once trusted media, but it makes me fell good, so there.

Fox News is and has been part of the Ministry of Propaganda.

They were never “conservative”

They work for the Cheap Labor Express.

They failed to convince us to give up our country without a fight by accepting McCain/Kennedy/Gang of Eight amnesty “reform”.

Next they failed to convince us that Trump could not be President. In every election since the last amnesty the GOP has nominated amnesty candidates, effectively blocking the citizens from stopping the illegal alien inundation.

This time they got Trumped and they are pissed. The most important thing to the establishment is preventing the citizens from reversing 30 years of bipartisan policy of non-enforcement of immigration laws.

They do not intend to allow us to keep the rule of law or our country.

This was the event that probably gelled lots of us early Trump supers into an adhoc team. That debate and the actions around it made me certain Trump was the guy. All of the things in this article were discussed then. I remember saying on this board the Meygan Kelly bookadvance was payment for her part in the attempted take down. This event began the transformation of how many view the GOPe, Fox, Conservative Media - They over played their hand and walked right into Trumps trap.

"Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch instructed Fox News executives to take down Donald Trump." Maybe.

But the real fact is that Fox News is almost uniformly pro-Trump, certainly in any Trump v. Hillary contest.

The number of obviously pro-Hillary reporters or analysts you can count on a few fingers (let's see... Juan, Alan, Jennifer... who?). I was not "pro-Trump", but favored somebody more genuinely conservative, like Ted Cruz, so I found Fox's reporting **surprise** Fair and Balanced.

Today I have no problems with any of the analyses from 90% of Fox's conservative personalities.

Sure, Megyn & Chris do nothing for me, but most of the others seem fine. So it's just inconceivable that any Fox conservatives would favor Hillary over Trump.

Just a guess, but I’d say that they see Hannity as preaching to his followers, not able to change hearts and minds, and Judge Jeanine is filler on a night when no one watches FNC anyhow. Since they live in the same bubble, they no doubt believe the powerful words of Brett, Meg, and Chris are the ones that can really influence people.

Remember those on FR with severe TDS denying the above and attacking Trump and us for saying “No thank you to Faux re their lynching masquerading as a debate.” I wonder how many of us stopped watching Faux after their Iowa planned lynching of Trump!

"Why when they have so many neverTrump people on?" TakebackGOP: Fair & Balanced, donchaknow? Fox's Trump & Hillary supporters are usually clearly identified ahead of time.

Allegedly impartial analysts -- UVA's Larry Sabato comes to mind -- do not reveal their own views, but nearly always respond to the pro-Trump views of the shows' hosts. A typical question to Sabato goes like this: "Larry, you've studied all the polls, so what does Trump have to do now to overcome Hillary's lead?" Sabato never tells us who he favors, but he does answer such questions, objectively, imho.

I saw Wallace discussing politics on a you tube video and his whole look has changed. He appeared to be squinting and beady eyed. He’s acting like his job depends upon him being a radical craven kook. I also saw that Fox morning show on you tube as they interviewed Trump’s son and the Brian guy, who used to play the good humored cut up guy is now Mr. Serious Left wing politics. How boring.

And I would say the entire performance backfired spectacularly. Instead of ruining Trump’s chances, it increased his popularity as he wittily fought back against the sneering and hateful Kelly! After that debacle, there was no way I was gong to turn against Trump. And I doubt I’m alone in that regard. Murdoch miscalculated bigtime. Hello, President Trump!

The one I watch is obviously pro-Trump from early morning to late-night.

None -- zero, zip, nada -- are clearly pro-Hillary. Of course, they do have pro-Hillary analysts and even some reporters, but none host a show and most get beaten up pretty severely by the hosts.

As I said, Megyn Kelly & Chris Wallace don't do anything for me, but I wouldn't call them obviously pro-Hillary.

How do Hannity and Judge Jeanine get away with criticizing Hillary and defending Trump? Hannity, especially, from the start has never made a secret out of his dedication to conservatism (and support of Republicans) and he has not wavered. In other words they knew what they were getting in Hannity. And remember he was a part of Hannity and Colmes when Colmes was demoted to contributor. So somebody liked Sean. In the case of Jeanine,some of the same reasons may apply, Im not sure.
