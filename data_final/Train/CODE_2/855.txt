Florida AG Shuts Down Boynton Beach Tech Support Scam

Florida AG Shuts Down Boynton Beach Tech Support Scam August 24, 2016 11:12 AM

TALLAHASSEE (CBSMiami)  A Boynton Beach tech support company which reportedly scammed its customers out of $25 million has been temporarily shut down again by court order, according to Floridas Attorney Generals Office.

The company Client Care Experts, formerly known as First Choice Tech Support, LLC, is owned by CEO Michael Seward and his partner Kevin McCormick. The states Attorney Generals Office said the operation was run out of a boiler room in Boynton Beach and employed more than 200 telemarketers at the location.

The court order follows an effort by McCormick and Seward to dissolve an earlier order obtained by the Attorney Generals Office that temporarily shut down the business, froze the companys assets and appointed a receiver to oversee the operation through the conclusion of the case. This week, the court denied the defendants motion to dissolve and kept the previous order in place pending the final judgement.

Floridians rely on computers to communicate with family and friends, make purchases and conduct business, and when scammers target these devices they can scare and frustrate consumers, especially our seniors. That is why we are working diligently to identify and stop tech scams targeting Floridians, said Attorney General Pam Bondi.

State investigators say the company used deceptive marketing tactics to create alarming pop-up windows claiming a persons computer was infected. The pop-up warnings directed them to contact a toll-free number. Once connected to the boiler room, unscrupulous sales agents posing as computer technicians would claim to conduct a computer diagnostic test that uncovered malware, according to state investigators. The sales agents would then reportedly convince the unsuspecting callers that they had to spend, on average, $250 to fix their devices.

Bondis complaint wants McCormick and Seward barred from engaging in deceptive business practices and seeks full restitution for those they reportedly scammed.

Isn’t she the one who decided to prosecute George Zimmerman? Yeah, to hell with her, if so.

Okay, but who's going to prison? "Someone's got to go to prison, Ben."

I wonder if this involves those polite Indian gentlemen who call every week to offer Windows technical support.

This crap happens to me a lot more often than I'd like. It locks up your computer and won't let you do anything and gives you a "help line" number. Don't panic, and don't call anybody. Press the "on" button that you use to start your computer until the machine turns completely off, wait a minute or so, and then re-start the machine. Works for me every time.

“Isnt she the one who decided to prosecute George Zimmerman? Yeah, to hell with her, if so.” You are incorrect. She is an enemy of the Democrat Left. And the Leftist media has been out to get her for years. Did Pam Bondi and Rick Scott Conspire to Give the Zimmerman Case to Angela Corey?

Submitted by Nancy Smith on July 18, 2013 - 8:11pm The conservative newspaper National Review — highly critical of Jacksonville State Attorney Angela Corey since the Zimmerman trial ended — sees a sinister collusion between Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and Gov. Rick Scott. Reporter Ian Tuttle questions the decison to give prosecution of the trial to Corey instead of Norm Wolfinger, state attorney for the 18th Circuit at the time Trayvon Martin was killed. http://www.sunshinestatenews.com/blog/did-pam-bondi-and-rick-scott-conspire-give-zimmerman-case-angela-corey Pamela Jo “Pam” Bondi (born November 17, 1965) is an American attorney, politician and member of the Republican Party who serves as the current Attorney General of Florida.[1]

no these guys are different. I was sent to their trap by a fake Amazon Technical support web site. I finally figured out it was a scam

I had a group of Jamaicans calling me up to twice a day for weeks telling me I had a virus and they were there to fix it. I hung up on them over and over. Finally, I had some free time and played around with them for over an hour. I was driving and didn’t even have my computer with me. I just kept making up reasons why they couldn’t access my computer. After an hour, a third guy came on the phone and we went round and round again. He was getting angry and started saying “Why are you wasting my time?” over and over again. I let him have it with every cuss word I could think of and told him that they had been wasting my time for weeks. And that I would track him down and “gut him like a fish” if they ever called back. Surprisingly, they never called again.

A n old farmer was trying to tell a young ag school graduate about how to feed hogs. He had a wheel barrow with ears of corn and he would place 4 or 5 ears at a time in the feeding trough. it took a long time. The Ag school grad was watching attentively and asked “wouldn’t it save time to just dump the whole load at once” The old farmer looked at him like he was crazy and said “what’s time to a hog?” Iknow I know...... its fun to lead those bastards on

I sometimes have a lot of fun with those idiots

by stringing them along for a half an hour or so.

I’m pretty sure I got one of those popups. I have a screenshot. It was easy to get rid of, but I can see a lot of noob seniors getting ripped off.

If it is a browser pop-up, there are probably easier ways than re-starting the computer. What I do (windows) is press CTRL+ALT+DEL, open the task manager, then quit the browser (firefox). Then when I re-open the browser, it asks me which of the windows and tabs I want to re-open. I deselect those windows or tabs that I think are associated with the problem, and then it just re-opens all the other browser tabs without the problem sites. There may be an even easier way, I’d have to look. I wish there was a way (and there may be, I don’t know) to do this same thing without closing the browser, but this way works. I do have several pop-up and ad blocking add-ons but they don’t seem to work all the time. One thing I wish for is a browser that gives total control to the user; not no auto-play of videos, no auto-play of sound, no auto-play of ads. An ideal software/browser should never leave the user at the mercy of the websites visited.
