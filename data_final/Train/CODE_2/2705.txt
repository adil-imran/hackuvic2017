Bangladesh needs to be very balanced in its approach in going forward with India and China with the correct economic and foreign policy to become a middle-income country by 2021, foreign and strategic affairs experts have said.

Talking to The Daily Star yesterday on Bangladesh and China establishing a “strategic partnership of cooperation”, experts said this is purely for commercial and economic development.

Former and serving diplomats, security and strategic experts said, Chinese President Xi Jinping's announcement to upgrade China's relationship with Bangladesh is not just diplomatic jargon but means an elevation in relationship.

Chronicling the evolution of relationship between the two Asian countries, a serving Bangladeshi Ambassador, who has long been following Bangladesh-China relations yesterday said, during the visit of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao in April 2005, the two countries established a “Comprehensive Cooperative Partnership” featuring long-term friendship, equality and mutual benefit.

Both sides also declared the year 2005 as the "Year of China-Bangladesh Friendship" to celebrate the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations.

During Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina visit to China in March 2010, the two countries issued a joint statement to build a "Closer Comprehensive Partnership of Cooperation."

Again in June 2014 during Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina visit to Beijing, Bangladesh and China agreed to further expand and raise their partnership of cooperation.

And this time (Oct 14-15, 2016), on the Chinese President's visit, the two countries issued a joint statement on “Establishing Strategic Partnership of Cooperation.”

So, the Ambassador said, both sides are continually working on improved relations since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1975.

Asked whether Dhaka's current bonhomie with Beijing will have any geo-political nuance that might concern New Delhi, the foreign affairs expert said India and other regional powers centering the Indian Ocean have nothing to worry about from this closer relationship as the two countries reiterated their commitment for a peaceful, stable, open, inclusive, and developing and prosperous South Asia.

Former Ambassador Humayun Kabir said, this strategic partnership has goals with a long term perspective in wide range of areas.

He said some quarters in India might look at the Bangladesh- China growing relationship as a challenge or concern. “But given the level of confidence and current relationship between Bangladesh and India, I think they can look at the ties very positively.”

The Chinese economic support on the mega projects will improve economy in Bangladesh, bring out people from poverty, build infrastructure, expand market, and explore new areas of development, that would also benefit India, he said.

As India and Bangladesh are moving forward with connectivity and expanding trade and investment, this cooperation with China would also contribute to those areas. He said, Bangladesh, China, and India can move together to achieve greater economic development in the region.

“If Bangladesh can handle or manage things with keen practicality, the Chinese investment may be win-win for all in the South Asia and South-East Asian region,” Humayun Kabir said.

Noted security and strategic affairs analyst Major Gen (Retd) Abdur Rashid said the huge Chinese investment in Bangladesh's mega projects are important opportunities for Bangladesh to reach its goal of becoming a middle-income country by 2021 and a developed country by 2041.

“None but China came forward with the billion dollar economic support. We must not cloud up this strategic relation with security and geo-politics because China is investing and giving financial support in our infrastructure, power and energy, information and communication technology, investment and blue economy,” he said.

In this context, he pointed out, India is also receiving China's support for their economic development. So India has no reason to be concerned at the turn in Dhaka-Beijing relation.

However, General Rashid suggested that Bangladesh must be careful and maintain a balance among the powerhouses and players in the region so that none feel aggrieved. Bangladesh should maintain a policy that will benefit its own economy and not hurt ties with others.

A senior official at the Foreign Ministry said, “I am not seeing any particular change or elevation of Bangladesh-China relations. Rather, I see Bangladesh-India relation is strengthening, not only politically, but also socially and culturally.”

The relation with China, he said, is basically economic. “The other dimension is international politics where Bangladesh counts on China's support.”

“With India, it may be less of defence, but more with security and that is in line with USA. Bangladesh's interest in the US State Department is largely supported in India,” the Foreign Ministry official observed.
