Instead of initially offering condolences, Donald Trump looked ahead to Election Day when reacting to news that Chicago Bulls star Dwyane Wade’s cousin had been killed. Nykea Aldridge, a mother of four, was reportedly caught in the crossfire while pushing a baby stroller in Chicago’s South Side on Friday.

“Dwayne [sic] Wade’s cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!” the GOP nominee tweeted Saturday morning.

The tweet stunned many on Twitter. It was somewhat similar to the “appreciate the congrats” message Trump had posted in June in the aftermath of the mass shooting at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub.

There’s nothing more horrifying than a presidential candidate patting himself on the back after someone is killed. https://t.co/TrrmEl0zpw — Josh Jordan (@NumbersMuncher) August 27, 2016

This is the digital equivalent of passing out yard signs at a funeral. Emotional intelligence here is less than 0 https://t.co/llFI8kDOcX — Tim Miller (@Timodc) August 27, 2016

Trump later updated his tweet with the correct spelling of Wade’s name but left the rest of the message intact. Then, four hours after sparking the initial firestorm, he posted another tweet offering his sympathies to the basketball player’s family.

My condolences to Dwyane Wade and his family, on the loss of Nykea Aldridge. They are in my thoughts and prayers. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 27, 2016





Trump has been making direct appeals to black voters in recent weeks. Last week, he held a rally in the predominantly white suburb of Dimondale, Mich., and asked the African-American community what they had to lose by supporting him.

“You’re living in your poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58 percent of your youth is unemployed,” Trump said. His stereotype of African-American neighborhoods was widely criticized as offensive.
