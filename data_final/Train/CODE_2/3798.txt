USS Mason Fired 3 Missiles to Defend From Yemen Cruise Missiles Attack

The crew of a guided-missile destroyer fired three missiles to defend themselves and another ship after being attacked on Sunday in the Red Sea by two presumed cruise missiles fired by Iran-backed Houthi-forces, USNI News has learned.

During the attack against USS Mason (DDG-87), the ships crew fired the missiles to defend the guided-missile destroyer and nearby USS Ponce (AFSB(I)-15) from two suspected cruise missiles fired from the Yemini shore, two defense officials told USNI News.

Mason launched two Standard Missile-2s (SM-2s) and a single Enhanced Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) to intercept the two missiles that were launched about 7 P.M. local time. In addition to the missiles, the ship used its Nulka anti-ship missile decoy, the sources confirmed. Mason was operating in international waters north of the strait of Bab el-Mandeb at the time of the attack.

According to a defense official on Monday, Mason employed onboard defensive measures against the first suspected cruise missile, although it is unclear whether this led to the missile striking the water or whether it would have struck the water anyway. The official did not specify that the defensive measure was a missile fired from the ship.

So did the captain have to consult a WH lawyer first, before defending themselves? Obama’s rules of engagement, you know.

Hillary’s ROE will not be any different so you can expect more of this crap to take place. Only with Trump will it subside.

1. We defended successfully. 2. We destroyed the enemy who fired at us. 3. More details about the devastation we unleashed on them? (/s)

Sounds like it was way way more serious than was previously characterised. If we don’t respond we are asking for more

“Obama lets them shoot back ?” Not likely, not in a fundamentally transformed military. Watch for a Court Martial, and a few billion for Yemen.

Why did we not shoot back? If we shot back, it might discourage the enemy from taking hostages later.

I don’t see anything in the article that says the Mason then began counter battery operations. Did I miss something? 5.56mm

It went to voicemail. The skipper acted anyway. Will expect to see him “purged” shortly.

Big improvement..! After the USS Cole was rammed and almost SUNK, the Captain forbade distribution of live ammo to the crew. NOT before the blast, okay..? AFTER the blast. Cuz he wanted to prevent a TRAGEDY. You think I'm kidding, but I'm NOT kidding. This is a YUGE improvement.

........to some of us, and depending what the targets were, he could go a long way toward redeeming himself if he did. A possible "enemy" target list could include towns such as: Mecca, Medina, Jedda, Tehran, Allepo, Damascus and all of the following towns in Iran: 1 - Tehran, Tehran Province. 2 - Mashhad, Khorasan Razavi Province. 3 - Isfahan, Isfahan Province. 4 - Karaj, Alborz Province. 5 - Tabriz, East Azerbaijan Province. 6 - Shiraz, Fars Province. 7 - Ahvaz, Khūzestān Province. 8 - Qom, Qom Province. That oughta about do in the Jihadis for another century plus stop them from getting nukes about that long also. And, oh by the way, Truman did not send "warnings" to Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Just sayin!

The target to hit should be Iran. Hopefully president Trump does so.

Operation Praying Mantis II', as approved by President Donald J. Trump. January 21, 2017, the beginning of '', as approved by President Donald J. Trump. If however, enough deceased and illegal aliens vote (oops, I mean 'undocumented residents'), then President Illary will order ' Operation Jizya', the giving of billions of additional dollars to the Islamic Republic of Iran (less a small handling fee of 10% to the Clinton Foundation), along with an apology for the existence of the US, and a promise to cease all aid to Israel and any Arab countries.

No one respects the Obama led military. The commander in chief identifies with the Jihad not the American people nor the Constitution.

Iran has been on a shopping spree this year. SAM missiles. Su-30 fighter planes. T-90 main battle tanks. And it looks like anti-ship missiles. Where did they get the money???

“Barry is gonna nuke SOMEBODY before he leaves office.” I think so too. Nice diversion for the Democrats.

Glad to hear that our defensive hardware did the job. Also glad that Captain deployed without hesitation. I would like to hear that event missile launcher was destroyed though. No mercy.

That poor captain will probably get court-marshaled.

The Emirates News Agency has just released pictures showing damage to the HSV Swift after it was destroyed in an attack on Saturday.

The HSV Swift was on a humanitarian mission in the Red Sea when it was targeted by Yemens Houthi group in a missile attack near the Bab al-Mandab strait off Yemen, a key chokepoint for ships transiting between the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Indian Ocean via the Suez Canal.

Details of the incident are still unclear. http://gcaptain.com/photos-show-catastrophic-damage-to-hsv-swift-following-missile-attack/

And then the ship destroyed the Yemeni shore battery. Probably sent some money to the Iranians.

How do we know they were actually in International waters? what were they doing there in the first place? It sounds like Obama is ordering the navy to get into position to invite an attack. The war between the Saudis and Yemen is none of our business - unless they are trying to start a false flag attack.

So you think that before the election, Obama wanted to show the utter failure of the Obama-Clinton Iran policy by reminding everyone that Iran was trying to take control the Red Sea?

It is complicated, and I would be guessing as to what actually happened, or if it has any connection to Obama and his policies or agenda. Since these incidents happened the military investigation of the so called missile attacks on the ships has come under question. this means that the retaliation could have most definitely been an over reaction, a knee jerk reaction or, was done to show their military might. In my opinion, anytime the US military is attacked they should defend themselves 100%. and if need be stop any further attacks on them. But with the political upheavals going on right now it makes me wonder if events like that are not created or fabricated to deflect from the political problems at home. I hope that was not the case.
