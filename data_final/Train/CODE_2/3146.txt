WHA Corporation Plc, the country's largest warehouse developer, aims to more than double its market capitalisation to 100 billion baht in 2019 through the earnings growth of companies under the group.

Continuous growth in all business units will boost WHA's earnings and consequently raise the company's share price and market capitalisation, chairman Somyos Anantaprayoon said.

The company, which owns the lion's share of Hemaraj Land and Development, had a market value of 46.7 billion baht as of Friday, a 590 percent surge from its initial public offering (IPO) of 6.76 billion in market capitalisation four years ago.

WHA plans to spend 35 billion baht to set up an industrial estate in Vietnam on 20,000 rai of land. The industrial estate has seven phases and is expected to be sold out within 22 years.

The first phase with 3,000 rai of land will start development and sales next year.

In the next five years, the company expects to expand its warehouse areas to 3.3 million square metres, of which 3 million will be in Thailand. It currently has 2.2 million sq m in Thailand.

WHA aims for its revenue to break 21 billion baht in 2019, fuelled by the company's investment plan to catch up with the government's Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), said Jareeporn Jarukornsakul, chief executive and vice-chairman.

Hemaraj announced it will raise up to 5.69 billion baht by offering Hemaraj Leasehold Real Estate Investment Trust (HREIT).

Hemaraj will allocate up to 569.36 million units of the property trust fund at a price of 10 baht each through an IPO within next month.

HREIT will spend 8.02 billion baht to invest in the holding rights of six land factories and warehouses of Hemaraj's industrial estates and logistic park, with a combined area of 261,314 sq m for 30 years, with an option for renewal of another 30 years.

WHA Corporation Real Estate Investment Trust (WHART)'s holders will have priority to subscribe for HREIT's units and the leftover units will be sold to Hemaraj, institutional investors and patrons of both Hemaraj and HREIT's selling agents.

Siam Commercial Bank (SCB) will act as HREIT's financial adviser and selling agent.

HREIT is estimated to yield 7.75-8% in return to unit trust holders in the first year, SCB's executive vice-president Veena Lertnimitr said.

WHA shares closed yesterday on the Stock Exchange of Thailand at 3.12 baht, down 14 satang, in trade worth 584 million baht.
