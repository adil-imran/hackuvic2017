Meat dragged exports down in the month of September according to Statistics NZ's latest Merchandise Trade Statistics.

Overall, goods exports were $3.5 billion in September, down $210 million (or 5.7 percent) compared to the same month last year. Meat exports were down $152 million (or 35 percent) to their lowest level in three years. The slide was equally evident for both main meat commodities with beef down 35 percent and lamb down 39 percent. Wool exports were also down 39 percent.

Exports of milk powder, butter and cheese exports also down but only slightly (by $8 million or 1.2 percent) and on the plus side there were strong monthly increases for fruit, seafood and forest products.

With imports up by $86 million (or 1.8 percent) to $4.9 billion, the monthly goods trade deficit was $1.4 billion, or 41 percent of exports. This comes after a $1.2 billion deficit in August. August and September are usually the quietest months for exports, due to seasonally lower volumes of agricultural exports. There were also some large one-offs on the imports side, such as aircraft. However, these deficits were bigger than economists' forecasts.

For the year ended September 2016, exports were $48.6 billion, down 1.1 percent on the previous year. Milk powder, butter and cheese were down 7.5 percent to $10.9 billion, while meat was down 6.6 percent to $6.2 billion.

Annual imports clocked in at $52.0 billion, down 0.6 percent on the previous year. This resulted in a widening of the annual goods trade deficit to $3.4 billion.

Business numbers are up according to Statistics NZ's annual Business Demography Statistics.

As at February 2016 there were 515,000 businesses in total, up 1.6 percent on 2015. They employed 2.1 million people, up 2.3 percent, with the 'average' business employing 4.0 people.

There were 69,300 agriculture, forestry and fishing businesses and they employed 120,000 people. The 'average' business employed 1.7 people - much less than the average for all businesses.

Statistics NZ has also released its annual Subnational Population Estimates for 2016. It shows that Auckland grew by 44,400 people (or 2.8 percent) to 1.6 million. Auckland's population growth accounted to 45 percent of the country's total growth of 97,300.

Other regions to grow rapidly included Canterbury (up 2.3 percent), Waikato (up 2.3 percent), and Bay of Plenty (up 2.2 percent). West Coast was the only region to decline (down 0.5 percent).

The fastest growing districts and cities were Queenstown-Lakes (up 7.1 percent) and Selwyn (up 6.7 percent), followed by Tauranga (up 2.9 percent). Growth exceeded 1 percent in 50 of New Zealand's 67 territorial authorities, with three declining in population: Wairoa, Buller and Grey districts.

Rapid population growth is likely to continue with Statistics NZ's latest National Population Projections, released last week, suggesting that New Zealand's population could exceed 5 million by 2020.
