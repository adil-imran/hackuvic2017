An Afghan refugee, whose portrait became one of the most iconic magazine covers in history, is set to be deported to Afghanistan from Pakistan after she pleaded guilty to acquiring Pakistani identity documents fraudulently, one of her lawyers said Friday.

Sharbat Gula, who became famous after a portrait of her as a girl was published on the cover National Geographic magazine in 1985, was arrested last week by Pakistani authorities.

Ms. Gula is among the millions of Afghans who sought refuge in Pakistan from the fighting that broke out after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Pakistani officials say 1.4 million Afghans still live in Pakistan as registered refugees. An estimated 400,000 Afghans, including Ms. Gula, are based in Pakistan as unregistered refugees.

In a court hearing Friday, Ms. Gula accepted the charges against her.

“She was given a punishment of 15 days in prison, and fined 110,000 rupees ($1,050),” said Mohsin Dawar, one of her lawyers.

Mr. Dawar said, Ms. Gula is expected to be released and deported next week.

Ms. Gula’s arrest got global attention, and top officials from both Afghanistan and Pakistan pledged to help her.

“She will be on her way back to her own country as soon as next Monday where she still is a beloved image and a national icon,” Omar Zakhilwal, the Afghan ambassador in Islamabad, wrote on his Facebook profile.

Amnesty International condemned Pakistan’s decision to deport Ms. Gula and said it was “a grave injustice.”
