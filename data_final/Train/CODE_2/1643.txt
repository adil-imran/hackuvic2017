Speaking ahead of the UN General Assembly meeting, she predicted that a free trade agreement would be mutually beneficial for the UK and the remaining 27 EU member states. She said: “We will be ambitious in what we want to see for the UK. A good deal for the UK can also be a good deal for the other member states.” “The 27 will sign up to a deal with us, we will be negotiating with them. We will be ambitious in what we want to see for the UK. “I’m a believer in good trading relations, I want the UK to be a global leader in free trade.” In an interview with a US radio station, Mrs May confirmed that she has begun preliminary talks with world leaders.

"There's a limit to what we can formally sign up to while we are still members of the European Union, and obviously, one of our negotiations is going to be our trade relationship with the EU, but I'm very clear, and I've been talking to leaders. I've talked to President Obama,” she said. "I've talked to other leaders around the world, and there is a real interest in ensuring that we can develop the economic and trading relationships between the UK and a number of other countries including the United States." Ivan Rogers is said to have warned his fellow EU ambassadors that the UK will hold trade negotiations as it simultaneously withdraws from the crumbling bloc. During a meeting this week, Mr Rogers reportedly announced that Liam Fox has already begun preliminary talks with countries willing to make a deal with Britain. He was warned by EU diplomats that the UK is not legally allowed to sign any agreements until it is completely divorced from Brussels. Secretary of State for International Trade Liam Fox sad said that 10 countries are already lined up to make deals with the UK, including India, China, Japan, Australia and Canada.

Will Australia make a trade deal with Britain? Australian trade minister Steven Ciobo met with International Trade Secretary Liam Fox to discuss what a UK-Australia trade deal might look like. While the UK is unable to enter into formal negotiations while still a member of the EU, Mr Ciobo confirmed that a deal would be completed “quite quickly” following Brexit. He added that “strong historical bonds” meant there was a “good alignment” between the two nations, with Australia even offering to loan experts to help with talks. In a joint statement, the two ministers announced the creation of a working group to discuss bilateral links. It will hold its first meeting in Australia in January. "We want the working group to advance an agenda that will ensure the expeditious transition to free trade agreement negotiations when the UK has formally completed its negotiations to exit the EU," the letter read.

Will the US make a trade deal with Britain? Outgoing President Barack Obama caused anger by suggesting that Britain would remain “at the back of the queue” for a trade deal with the US. Speaking at the G20 summit, he said that American Government would instead focus on its stalling TTIP negotiations with the EU, although he wanted to “ensure that we don't see any adverse effects in trading and commercial relationships between the United States and the United Kingdom." Both of Mr Obama’s potential successors, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, have confirmed they would forge ahead with a UK-US trade deal and ditch TTIP.

Will China make a trade deal with Britain? Chinese President Xi Jinping told Mrs May that he is "entirely open to a bilateral trading relationship" with the UK during their G20 meeting, which he said had “provided solid groundwork” for a future deal. The Prime Minster agreed to visit China again next year after the positive meeting despite concerns over her refusal to green light the Hinkley Point nuclear power station – of which China is the main investor. Mrs May has so far failed to approve the project over fears that China could hold Britain’s power supply to ransom. Mr Xi said that his Government will be “patient” while she makes her decision.
