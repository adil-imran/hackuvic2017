When the capital’s biggest landfills, Bhalswa and Ghazipur, caught fire in April, Environment Minister Imran Hussain had tweeted that 15 fire tenders would be stationed at the Bhalswa landfill site round-the-clock. In the past week when fires broke out at Bhalswa, there wasn’t a single fire tender at the site and the fire brigade had to be called.

The fires in April, which came into the limelight as they were reported in the midst of the second odd-even road rationing scheme, raised enough eyebrows for a committee — comprising officials from the Delhi government’s Delhi Pollution Control Committee, transport department, revenue department and urban development department — to be set up. Permanent stationing of fire trucks at landfill sites was one of the recommendations made by the committee.

Six months later, as the city’s air quality starts to dip, the list of recommendations made by the committee have been ignored. Among these recommendations were long-term plans as well as small changes that could be implemented in a few day’s time, such as stationing fire trucks near the landfill sites. Hussain could not be contacted despite repeated attempts. The Indian Express conducted a spot check at the Bhalswa and Ghazipur landfill sites to review the status of the recommendations.

There was a problem between the two consultants and we did not get a final report. The recommendations, though, are under consideration
