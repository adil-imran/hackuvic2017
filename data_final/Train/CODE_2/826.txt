“In terms of the actual vote itself, if you’re here at a rally and you’ve not yet volunteered to participate in the electoral process by respectfully providing accountability at a polling place come Election Day, then you haven’t yet done all you can do,” Pence said. ”Voter fraud cannot be tolerated by anyone in this nation. Demand that our public officials are upholding the integrity of the vote, but do all you can to respectfully participate in the process and ensure the outcome, an outcome we can all be proud of,” he said

“You have potentially a really catastrophic situation here. I’ll be honest with you.
