Conservative Central H.S. student gets lesson in intolerance

Posted on by Phillyred

Michael Moroz was prepared for backlash.

But he wasnât expecting death threats.

The 17-year-old, a senior at Central High School, recently wrote an opinion piece for the schoolâs newspaper criticizing protests by student racial-justice activists at the University of Missouri. It ran alongside a piece that applauded the demonstrations.

Moroz pulled no punches, calling Michael Brown, the black teenager killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., âa delinquentâ who was âat worst, justifiably killed, and at best, a thug.â Moroz dismissed Missouri studentsâ demands as ânonsensical,â and blasted protesters who went on a hunger strike.

Things blew up once the story hit the Centralizerâs Facebook page shortly after Philadelphia schools let out for winter break. On social media, there were calls to âdeal withâ Moroz and âshootâ him, and he was decried as a racist. Fearing for his safety, Moroz did not attend school Monday.

âI definitely felt threatened,â said Moroz, a Northeast Philadelphia resident and the newspaperâs managing editor. âItâs hard not to feel threatened.â

Student editors pulled Morozâs piece from the newspaperâs website when the online commentary began turning ominous toward Moroz and said in a Facebook message that âif an article comes across as insensitive, and the Central community would rather have it taken down â¦ then the article will be taken down.â

Later, administrators at Central, one of the cityâs top schools, backed the studentsâ decision.

Twenty-Five Top Quotes from the DOJ's Report on the Michael Brown Shooting http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/doj_report_on_shooting_of_michael_brown_1.pdf (For official DOJ report, Google "DOJ Report on Shooting of Michael Brown PDF.") [01] The evidence, when viewed as a whole, does not support the conclusion that Wilsonâs uses of deadly force were âobjectively unreasonableâ under the Supreme Courtâs definition. (Page 5) [02] when the store clerk tried to stop Brown, Brown used his physical size to stand over him and forcefully shove him away. (Page 6) [03] Wilson was aware of the theft and had a description of the suspects as he encountered Brown and Witness 101. (Page 6) [04] Autopsy results and bullet trajectory, skin from Brownâs palm on the outside of the SUV door as well as Brownâs DNA on the inside of the driverâs door corroborate Wilsonâs account that during the struggle, Brown used his right hand to grab and attempt to control Wilsonâs gun. (Page 6) [05] there is no credible evidence to disprove Wilsonâs account of what occurred inside the SUV. (Page 7) [06] autopsy results confirm that Wilson did not shoot Brown in the back as he was running away because there were no entrance wounds to Brownâs back. (Page 7) [07] witnesses who originally stated Brown had his hands up in surrender recanted their original accounts (Page 8) [08] several witnesses stated that Brown appeared to pose a physical threat to Wilson as he moved toward Wilson. (Page 8) [09] The physical evidence also establishes that Brown moved forward toward Wilson after he turned around to face him. The physical evidence is corroborated by multiple eyewitnesses. (Page 10) [10] evidence does not establish that it was unreasonable for Wilson to perceive Brown as a threat while Brown was punching and grabbing him in the SUV and attempting to take his gun. (Page 11) [11] Wilsonâs account is corroborated by physical evidence and that his perception of a threat posed by Brown is corroborated by other eyewitnesses (Page 12) [12] Wilsonâs account was consistent with those results, and consistent with the accounts of other independent eyewitnesses, whose accounts were also consistent with the physical evidence. Wilsonâs statements were consistent with each other in all material ways, and would not be subject to effective impeachment for inconsistencies or deviation from the physical evidence.8 Therefore, in analyzing all of the evidence, federal prosecutors found Wilsonâs account to be credible. (Page 16) [13] Witness accounts suggesting that Brown was standing still with his hands raised in an unambiguous signal of surrender when Wilson shot Brown are inconsistent with the physical evidence, are otherwise not credible because of internal inconsistencies, or are not credible because of inconsistencies with other credible evidence. (Page 78) [14] Multiple credible witnesses corroborate virtually every material aspect of Wilsonâs account and are consistent with the physical evidence. (Page 78) [15] several of these witnesses stated that they would have felt threatened by Brown and would have responded in the same way Wilson did. (Page 82) [16] there are no witnesses who could testify credibly that Wilson shot Brown while Brown was clearly attempting to surrender. (Page 83) [17] There is no witness who has stated that Brown had his hands up in surrender whose statement is otherwise consistent with the physical evidence. (Page 83) [18] The media has widely reported that there is witness testimony that Brown said âdonât shootâ as he held his hands above his head. In fact, our investigation did not reveal any eyewitness who stated that Brown said âdonât shoot.â (Page 83) [19] Wilson did not know that Brown was not armed at the time he shot him, and had reason to suspect that he might be when Brown reached into the waistband of his pants as he advanced toward Wilson. (Page 84) [20] Wilson did not have time to determine whether Brown had a gun and was not required to risk being shot himself in order to make a more definitive assessment. [21] In addition, even assuming that Wilson definitively knew that Brown was not armed, Wilson was aware that Brown had already assaulted him once and attempted to gain control of his gun. (Page 85) [22] Wilson has a strong argument that he was justified in firing his weapon at Brown as he continued to advance toward him and refuse commands to stop, and the law does not require Wilson to wait until Brown was close enough to physically assault Wilson. (Page 85) [23] we must avoid substituting our personal notions of proper police procedure for the instantaneous decision of the officer at the scene. We must never allow the theoretical, sanitized world of our imagination to replace the dangerous and complex world that policemen face every day.â (Page 85) [24] âIt may appear, in the calm aftermath, that an officer could have taken a different course, but we do not hold the police to such a demanding standard.â (citing Gardner v. Buerger, 82 F.3d 248, 251 (8th Cir. 1996) (same))). Rather, where, as here, an officer points his gun at a suspect to halt his advance, that suspect should be on notice that âescalation of the situation would result in the use of the firearm.â Estate of Morgan at 498. An officer is permitted to continue firing until the threat is neutralized. See Plumhoff v. Rickard, 134 S.Ct. 2012, 2022 (2014) (âOfficers need not stop shooting until the threat has endedâ). For all of the reasons stated, Wilsonâs conduct in shooting Brown as he advanced on Wilson, and until he fell to the ground, was not objectively unreasonable and thus not a violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 242. (Page 85) [25] Given that Wilsonâs account is corroborated by physical evidence and that his perception of a threat posed by Brown is corroborated by other eyewitnesses, to include aspects of the testimony of Witness 101, there is no credible evidence that Wilson willfully shot Brown as he was attempting to surrender or was otherwise not posing a threat. (Page 86) For the reasons set forth above, this matter lacks prosecutive merit and should be closed.

Central used to be the top public school in Philly, where the most gifted boys were sent (the most gifted girls got to go to Girls High). Now, Marxists want everyone to be identical; that is, the lowest common denominator. Hence, no conservative thought allowed.

To: TigersEye

On liberals’ (Marxist) violence - the ideology is based on coveting and that is one of the big ten to avoid in mentality because it leads to rape, theft and violence. Leftists stand on coveting as THE major principal of their lives and being. This is why those who adopt the leftist ideology manage to murder and sadistic abuse of millions when they get total power.

Leftists always inflame violence through tribalism.

There’s anecdotal evidence showing liberalism is caused by a parasite in the brain. I’m inclined to believe it.
