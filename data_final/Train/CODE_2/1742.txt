I hope Jeremy [Corbyn] will support me in such a move.”
“Jeremy Corbyn’s decision to call for Article 50 to be invoked immediately after the referendum result was deeply irresponsible and, if he had been listened to, would have damaged Britain’s interests.” The British people were lied to by the Leave campaign – they deserve to have a say on whatever exit deal the Tories strike with the EU. Theresa May says that ‘Brexit means Brexit’ – but nobody knows what Brexit looks like. It could involve trashing workers’ rights and environmental protections, opening our NHS up to foreign competition, making it harder for us to trade with our neighbours and damaging our economy.“I’m a passionate pro-European, and I will fight tooth and nail to keep us in the EU.”
This pledge is clearly an attempt by Smith to appeal to Labour voters who mostly support Britain staying in the EU. Corbyn’s critics accuse of him failing to campaign enthusiastically enough for Britain to stay in the 28-nation bloc in the lead-up to the June 23 referendum.MARK TEXTOR: Starstruck political fanboys need to reassess their definition of a political heroElon Musk may singlehandedly revive a business practice that's gone out of styleNew Zealand's 'rockstar' economy does it again as unemployment tumbles to an 8-year lowIt looks like the tobacco industry found a way around Australia's tough plain packaging lawsNintendo Pulls The Plug On Wii UCuriosity Just Found A Freaky Metal Meteorite On MarsStop What You're Doing: There's A New xXx: Return Of Xander Cage TrailerACMI's Game Changer Is A One-Day VR Festival In MelbourneAn Interview With A 'Boring' GamerI Can't Stop Watching This Destiny Player Wreck Trials All By HimselfA Look At The Civilizations Of CivilizationNobody Asked For This, But Cruis'n Is BackMicrosoft Releases Minecraft Education Edition in AustraliaHow Customisable Is The 2016 MacBook Pro Range?Waltr 2 Simplifies Sending Any File Type To Your iPhone Or iPad WirelesslyEnable The Classic Startup Chime On The New MacBook Pro With A Terminal Command
