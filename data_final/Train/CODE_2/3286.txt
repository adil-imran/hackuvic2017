The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State has described as a manifestation of frustration, the media attacks on the Minister of Transportation, Mr. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) following allegations against him by Justices John Inyang Okoro and Sylvester Ngwuta of the Supreme Court.

The party stated that the frustration was as a result of the fact that Amaechi, who is the immediate past Rivers State governor, spearheaded the dislodging of the PDP government at the centre during the 2015 general elections.

Chairman of APC in the state, Dr. Davies Ibiamu Ikanya, in a statement issued in Port Harcourt yesterday by his senior special assistant on Media and Publicity, Eze Chukwuemeka Eze, also described the calls by the leadership of the opposition party at the state and national levels for the resignation of Amaechi as vindictive, laughable, mischievous and shameless.

Ikanya said, “These calls being championed by the PDP are just the latest manifestation of the party’s frustration and fight against Amaechi in retaliation for his role in dislodging the PDP government at the centre during the 2015 presidential elections.

“These useless calls based on the unfounded and baseless attempted bribery allegations against the former Rivers State Governor and the Minister of Transportation confirms our fears and stand that the two discredited Justices made these allegations as part of a political strategy to destroy APC and run down the political fortunes of this rising star.

“PDP is only acting out its frustration over the key role that Amaechi played to end the corruption system engineered by the past PDP administration at the centre but let us assure the public that this plot has already failed before it was hatched because no sound Nigerian will buy this lame allegation that have no logical stand.

“Having failed to deny him the 2007 PDP gubernatorial ticket and to stop his appointment as a Minister, PDP is now sponsoring some unpatriotic, chronic corrupt and confused Judges to start mentioning Amaechi’s name in the hope that doing so will save them.
