MANILA, Philippines - Following budget cuts, the Department of Agriculture (DA) has moved by another two years its target to achieve 100 percent rice self-sufficiency.

“We will have a slight delay, probably by 2020 to 2021. We will just have to make use of what we have. It’s difficult but I have to wage the battle. We just have to really focus on our resources and lessen our expenses,” Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Piñol told The STAR in a phone interview.

The finance team of the Department of Budget and Management did not approve the P18 billion Rice Productivity Enhancement (RIPE) program, the first tranche of the three-year rice program worth P64 billion that would focus on rice production including seeds, inputs, new areas, irrigation projects and fertilizers.

The approved budget of the DA and its attached agencies for 2017 was P50.6 billion, P3.4 billion lower than this year’s level.

The Agri chief proposed a 31 percent increase in the DA’s 2017 budget to P71 billion

Piñol originally planned to attain self-sufficiency in rice in 2018, but moved it to 2019 due to insufficient funds.

The DA was earlier looking to produce 18.5 million metric tons of rice next year, 20.3 million MT in 2018 and 21.6 million MT in 2019.

Pinol said the 2017 budget was also affected by the P7 billion unspent fund from the previous administration.

“The past performance of the DA in terms of absorption and expenditure also affected our budget ceiling. The Finance team based their budget ceiling on the previous administration performance,” he added.

“I still believe that unless government makes huge investments in agriculture and fisheries, we will never be successful in our effort to combat poverty in the countryside and ensure food sufficiency for the country,” Piñol said.

Despite being unhappy with the 2017 budget, Piñol is not complaining and will make sure its budget will be effectively spent for programs that will ensure greater food production and reduce poverty in the country.

“We cannot sulk in disappointment simply because we did not get what we were asking for. This is a challenge for us to think of other ways to achieve food sufficiency,” he added.

Given the budget reduction, Piñol said he would cut the travel and international meetings of employees and officials which would not have an impact on the department’s programs.
