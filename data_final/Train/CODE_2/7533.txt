Clinton: I cheated Bernie last time and now I will cheat all America. They'll never believe it.

Youtube ^ | October 14, 2016 | Project Veritas

Posted on by Beautiful_Gracious_Skies

Video only. Full title: Clinton: I cheated Bernie last time and now I will cheat all America. They will never believe it.

my Transcript from the video:

Alan Schulkin - Commisioner Board of Elections -NYC.

There's lots of voter fraud going on out there.

They put people in busses and move them around to certain neighborhoods. They drive them from polling site to polling site to vote.... The buses frequent all kinds of minority neighborhoods: Black, Hispanic, and Chinese.

We can't ask for ID. It is against the law to ask for identification to vote in NY.

Doesn't matter anyway, Mayor de Blasio gave out ID cards. You can use them to do everything. It's costing the state a lot of money. He doesn't care about the voting.

And who is going to pay for all this? You are the taxpayer. He doesn't care.

There's absentee ballot voter fraud in the thousands, I know where these ballots come from.

And people can hide their face with a veil or burka and you have no idea who they are when they vote; or how many times they vote.

Your vote doesn't count much any more. It gets discounted.

I take my voting seriously and my vote doesn't count for much. We have some people voting multiple times and they aren't even a citizen.

The interviewer ask if Schulkin is voting for Hillary, he says he doesn't have much of a choice. Al says these programs are costing the state a lot of money and he is getting very concerned as he's getting older. I hope Al keeps his job.

Poor Al.

He’ll be pilloried (if not worse) for telling the truth.



To: Beautiful_Gracious_Skies

I hope he votes for Trump



To: Beautiful_Gracious_Skies

This video is a couple of weeks old,De Blasio wasn’t too happy



To: Beautiful_Gracious_Skies

The last semi-principled democrat, I fear for what will happen to him.



To: Tx Angel

Maybe Obama will what this and other videos, as he said yesterday when he told Trump to stop whining that there was no shred of evidence. He is a “Denier” of a different kind. What a photo-op when he has to transition and give the keys to the WH to Trump.



To: Beautiful_Gracious_Skies

I Trump beats her butt tonight.

The title is misleading. Hillary Clinton does not actually appear in the video, which is a re-post of a Project Veritas video.

An honest man.



To: Beautiful_Gracious_Skies

The title reads like it’s quoting Hillary. Did I miss something?

Yea, the title sucked me in too. (We know she says this in private w her pals.) This is the listed title of the Youtube creator and we shouldn’t alter titles. Plus you know that it is 100% entirely true.



To: Beautiful_Gracious_Skies

Why do you hope he keeps his job? He’s a guy that has first hand knowledge of crimes regarding election integrity. He’s a guy that is in a position to do something about it and chooses not to. He deserves a supoena and deposition.

The title is the title used on the video landing. It's actually a You Tube account named Hillary Clinton. Looks like the account was created 5 days ago. LMAO..... It is definitely an eye opening video from Project Veritas.

Call me naive... When I vote, my voting pct has a book that I have to sign to match the signature that is in the book. I always produce my ID anyway,because for some strange reason it pisses the election people off!!!!...I guess other voting places you can just show up and vote 5 times????



To: Beautiful_Gracious_Skies

A sadly misleading title.



To: Beautiful_Gracious_Skies

in my upper west side building in Manhatfan, our lobby was the voting location for our area. Vans would routinely pull up and people would go in to vote. Note a precient in Manhattan is tiny geographically. At most it’s a couple of blocks to walk. The vans are clearly going from polling place to polling place.

So you expect me to arbitrarily change their title? Or you want the mod to take it away and have it re-titled to your personal preference which is____________________? While it was more recently posted, it is dated December 15, 2015 within the video and it IS legitimate. A cursory search demonstrates this below. So why are you a tattler? Elections official caught on video blasting de Blasios ID ...

To: Damifino

I hope he keeps his head for daring to speak the truth. Doubtful that he can control or change the business of voting in NYC. He’s probably already toast. Poor Al.



To: Beautiful_Gracious_Skies

In the first post-Saddam elections in Iraq, they made people dip their finger in ink after voting to help ensure integrity. Naturally, we could never do such a thing here in America. We would never want to have honest elections or anything!

Trust American ingenuity; a democrat manufacturer would sell fake index finger covers to get around the law!!!



To: Beautiful_Gracious_Skies

I wish the creators had titled the video properly and I would have shared it on social media... It shows some shameful stuff and a misleading title like that seriously detracts from it.
