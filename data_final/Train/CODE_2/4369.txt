District and Principal Sessions judge V. Shreeshananda on Friday granted conditional bail to those arrested in connection with last weekâ€™s violence during the Navalgund farmers protest.

The judge had, on Thursday concluded hearing advocates representing people from Navalgund and reserved judgment for Friday. Conditional bail was granted to all 179 persons.

The Dharwad District Bar Association represented the petitioners, while the public prosecutor refrained from filing objection to the bail petition moved by the petitioners.

Conditions

The judge has directed the petitioners not to tamper with prosecution witnesses in any manner, and they should not hamper the investigation in any way.

The petitioners shall not repeat a similar offence which would affect peace and tranquillity in the area. They should not leave the jurisdiction of the court without prior permission.

The judge has also asked the petitioners to mark their attendance in the respondent police station on Mondays between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. till the charge-sheet is filed.

While making the attendance before the police, the accused/petitioners shall maintain law and order situation, peace and tranquillity in and around the police station.

If any of the above conditions are violated by the petitioners, the prosecution is at liberty to seek cancellation of the bail, the judge said. Dharwad Bar Association president V.D. Kamraddi, advocates P.H. Neeralkeri, B.D. Hiremath, A.S. Shinde, V.G. Holeyannavar, Ramesh Badnoor, H.C. Kori and K.H. Patil were present.
