Movement for Democratic Change Vice President Thokozani Khupe was briefly detained and quizzed by police in Magunje for addressing an unsanctioned meeting at Chiedza business centre on Saturday.

The party’s Mashonaland West provincial spokesperson Blessing Mandava said in a statement the police were abusing sections of Public Order and Security Act, Posa.

“It is our observation that the police are misinterpreting sections of Posa to restrict our movementr as a party. It seems they have imposed an unofficial quarantine on Hurungwe West so that the June 10 by election skeletons may not be exposed. As a party and province, we will not be intimidated by these political gimmicks meant to dampen our spirits and quash our grassroots activities” said Mandava.

He added that police were keen to interview other senior members of the party including provincial chairperson Ralph Magunje, treasurer David Mutambirwa, organising secretary Wilson Makanyaire and Richard Mubaiwa.

Although there was no immediate police confirmation, some sources said there was confusion in the camp after police had cleared the meeting at Karereshi area.

“It is unfortunate that some party members were misled by a senior member after police turned down that application although they approved another venue. There are some members trying to create confusion and confrontation with authorities” said a member who declined to be named for fear of victimisation.
