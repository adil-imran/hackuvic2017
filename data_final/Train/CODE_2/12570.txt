New York Times' Dire Warning About Polling Accuracy (rutt rohh)

zero hedge ^ | 8-17-2016 | Tyler Durden

Posted on by ak267

As I demonstrated in yesterdays article, How Bloomberg Spun its Own Poll Data to Make Hillary Clinton Seem Inevitable, the media is intentionally spinning poll results at best, and completely fabricating them at worst.

While thats bad enough, there are also some deep, fundamental problems which plague any attempts to conduct accurate polling in 2016. Cliff Zukin, professor of public policy and political science at Rutgers University and a past president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, wrote about many of these issues in a 2015 New York Times opinion piece titled, Whats the Matter With Polling?

Hillary can’t fill a high school gym while Trump can’t find a venue large enough to hold his supporters.. You figure who’s lying.

When Bush defeated Kerry, the left said that fake voting was to blame because the votes did not align with exit polls. They of course ignored the fact that the left feels entitled to public abuse as inferior anyone not voting for their candidate - it seemed obvious that no one wanted to admit to exit polls that they voted for Bush. So, if the vote goes to Clinton, then libs are fine with it and if the vote goes to Trump, then they will cite more accurate “exit polls” as “proof” yet again, that they wuz robbed.



To: Don Corleone

They are starting to get very nervous. The scam polling cat is out of the bag.



To: ak267

So NOW the NY Times and LA Times are WARNING about polls WTH!!!! These campaigns have in house polling data don’t they ???? They MUST know the truth!!!



To: Col Frank Slade

“The scam polling cat is out of the bag.”

They’re laying the groundwork for an “unexpected” swing excuse on why they got things so wrong.

Trump is asking for volunteers to do poll watching, he has hired 7,000 attorneys to take care of ANY discrepancies nation wide!!!! There are 180,000 polling places nation wide so WE NEED to volunteer there are numbers directly to attorneys for each area volunteers are to call!!! Freepers get onto Trumps website and VOLUNTEER!!!!!!!

Pollsters today are like the buggy whip makers in the early 1900s, facing economic devastation because they cant poll many people. They are in a losing battle with social media. Many of the so called pollsters have been Democrat Operatives for decades going back to when they predicted Carter would beat Reagan. Now, they are trying to compete with cell phones, social media and the problem of less landline phones. More and more people on both ends of the age spectrum do not have landline phones. They only have cell phones. Does anyone with a cell phone ever answer any unknown numbers and specifically any 800 #s?

Probably not. We use no more robocalls on our two land lines. Zero pollsters have gotten through since we started using no more robocalls, 2 plus years ago. None of our voting age relatives have received a call from any pollster this election. That is 20+ Trump voters. Then, there is this on social media versus polls:

Social Media Patterns Show Trump Is Looking at a Landslide Victory Gateway Pundit ^ | Aug 7th, 2016 | Jim Hoft

Posted on 8/7/2016, 8:32:37 AM by detective Current polls show the race for President is much tighter than it really is. Ann Coulter warned us years ago in her bestseller Slander that Democrats and the liberal media always use polls to manipulate and discourage conservatives from voting. Thanks to social media there is more and more evidence that the polls are way off and if things stay as they are, Trump will win in a landslide! Its evident that, Hillary has a hard time filling a Union Hall or high school gym while Trump regularly turns people away from his stadium and arena venues. http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/3457347/posts A final question have you or any Trump voters, you know, actually been polled this year?

I know for certain that polling results show that Donald Trump

is finished here in August 2015. The likely candidates will be Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush. News Cartel/ You Must Believe Us Survey

3.5 % margin of error.

So, if the vote goes to Clinton, then libs are fine with it and if the vote goes to Trump, then they will cite more accurate exit polls as proof yet again, that they wuz robbed. True but to be fair I have seen the same thing thing happen around here in reverse. In any event this NYT article is correct in that building election projections around dialing up people via dinosaur landlines is (and has been) antiquated. It also makes it harder for dems to know how many extra votes they must steal. This is the real reason the dems will demand better polling methods.



To: combat_boots

You are the first. Where you called on a land line or cell phone? Who polled you? Thanks

To: ak267

So Bloomberg decided to put a gun to the head of the people who said they wouldn’t vote...amazing



To: Grampa Dave

There’ve been two calls, IIRC. Both were land line based. One was automated, one live person.



by 16 posted onby combat_boots (MSM: We lie to you sheep at the slaughterhouse to keep you calm during slaughter)

To: ak267

Its because the polls have been bogus and they know it..to save face as it gets closer to closer to election day all of a sudden it will show Trump in the lead



To: dirtboy

I’m pretty sure 98% of folks here in the U.S.A. think the same way....

Did they call you on your landline? Thanks

To: Grampa Dave

The probability of you being polled for a national political survey is 00000428% In that poll, the Margin of Error for that poll would be 3.5%.



To: ak267

Here is the money quote: “Some polling organizations will move to sampling from voter lists, which will miss recently registered voters and campaigns efforts to mobilize them.” So this is where the recent “likely voter” polls get there outdated information. They are missing a large chunk of Trump voters. But, of course, that’s ok...because it fits their narrative.

Hillary cant fill a high school gym HALF a high school gym ! ML/NJ

Reuter Roooters is “warning” Dems(?) LoL about the polls. “(Reuters) Pollster warns Clinton’s lead over Trump is so” http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/3460409/posts Pollster are so full of it.



I saw a stats geek’s piece...think it was at 538....saying “the pols are accurate” Yet in the same week you can find a poll that has it a 1 point race and a TEN point race. They can’t BOTH be true.....



To: ak267

With all the media going after Trump... what makes anyone think their polls would be accurate if Trump was ahead. These aren’t romney polls. these are TRUMP polls. They’d report them in favor if Trump? not on your life! Fox news spent 1 hour hating Trump this evening .. 5 minutes on hillary. They do not understand YET.. that they are insulting millions of voters who have more sense than any in Washington. If ya don’t think like they do, you’re an idiot. Idiocracy is that there are people who see nothing wrong with what all she has done and would vote for her .. Blows my mind that this country is THERE.



To: Grampa Dave

“More and more people on both ends of the age spectrum do not have landline phones. They only have cell phones.” That’s why poll questions are weighted. With that pollsters can determine the answers that cell phone only households would provide if they were to be polled. With weighting, and an accurate sample frame, pollsters can interview 856 people and obtain results with 3.5% margin or error.



To: ransomnote

If Trump should be able to overwhelm Rat fraud the libtards can whine all they want. The question is, “What are they prepared to do about it?”. Nothing unless I underestimate libtards. Ask the converse question and an entirely different result will come forth.

There are libs around these parts who still moan that the election was out and out stolen by Bush/Repubs and now we’ve got anarchists hard at work using police for hunting practice while claiming that they are the victims. If libs lose, these forces will join with the “intelletual” left which has openly whined that they wish Obama could be a dictator (then everything will be ok). Toss in the jihadis and it could be a violent race war/terrorism start to the next administration. Or we could get lucky and all the lib whiners/anarchists/and intellectuals will immigrate to the lovely UAE where everyone is “freer” to be good.

I got no heartburn either way. Immigrate or fight. We win.

We use no more robocalls on our two land lines. Zero pollsters have gotten through since we started using no more robocalls, 2 plus years ago.” ditto. and i also have a white list to let those through I want, and a catchall filter that shunts the rest to an interactive voice response of me explaining how to press 1 if you want to talk with me. that little baby stops the rest cold. And i’m building my own block list of numbers that routes them to a “this number is no longer in service” message followed by the related ‘Special Information Tones’ (S.I.T.)tone, which robocaller equipment will respond to by deleting your number from its lists. Now that has REALLY cut down on the junk calls as the word gets out that my number has been disconnected!

Some bad ones sneak through, usually local ones, and I put them on a call forwarding list. Their calls get forwarded to the local DA’s office to report scams. They never call again.

A final question have you or any Trump voters, you know, actually been polled this year? I have been robo-called on an unpublished digital phone at my office since the beginning of the primaries (not so much lately though). Once in a while I listen until the machine asks for the first response. The questions are always aimed at someone living hundreds of miles from where I work. They need to work on their location algorithm.

What does “rutt rohh” mean in the header? .



To: Mears

IIRC it is from the Soupy Sales show where one of the characters, a dog, couldn’t say uh oh and instead said rutt rohh



To: morphing libertarian

Thanks-—my God,Soupy Sales——haven’t heard him mentioned in years. .



To: morphing libertarian

Did Scoobie-Doo steal it from Soupy Sales? because Rut Roh was Scoobie the dog saying uh oh in the cartoon series. it was one of his signature phrases.

you may be correct. I stated IIRC and I am losing it slowly. I thought white fang used to say it, but I stand corrected. And of course Sales preceded Scooby.



To: dirtboy

I only have a mobile phone and I dont answer any number I dont recognize. I figure if its important, theyll leave a message and a call-back number. Exactly. That's undoubtedly what 99+% of most people with smart phones do. And everybody and their brother has a smart phone nowadays. This reinforces more than ever how Freepers should not allow themselves to be discouraged over these pro-Hillary poll numbers. I think the Media and Establishment (but I repeat myself) are in for a rude awakening the night of November 8. Every single conservative should make sure they vote, no matter how negative the spin is, and make sure they get out the vote of their family and friends. Trump is going to win, and win BIG! The article stated that back in the "old days" during the 1980's, pollsters considered 80% response rate to be acceptable. Over the last couple of decades, response rates have plummeted, and now stand at less than 10%! And the Media is trying to have everyone believe that these polls are accurate? Don't fall for it, people. I'm more convinced than ever, due to the facts of the unreliability of modern day polling, that these rosy numbers for Hillary are absolute garbage. And the Establishment KNOWS it. It's the elephant in the room that they refuse to acknowledge. So I don't want to see any more despondent, hysterical hand-wringing from Freepers, because, at this point, it flies in the face of all the real evidence we're seeing of Trump's solid and growing support. We need to spread the info far and wide that modern-day polling has devolved into almost total guesswork and wishful thinking. These polls are more propaganda than ever! Whenever they are accurate, it's probably more by accident than anything else... Vote Trump!

Same here... I quit watching Fox.. TV was on and heard most of it... hard to watch that stuff. The gal who is taking the 9 pm Fox slot, (looks like megyn is gone?) is doing a great job.. I’m in a position that the TV is on where I am this week.. otherwise I would not know whose on any of the channels. .. but she is obviously not a liberal and is defending Trump.... pretty too.. she’s a lot better than megyn ever was.



To: frnewsjunkie

This Megan fill in is Trish Regan she is from the Fox Business channel, which is what I have been watching lately instead of Fox News! Trish IS GREAT I hope Megan leaves permanently and Trish stays!!! I am only watching because of Trish I hope the ratings go up while Megan is gone!!!



To: frnewsjunkie

I guess I snapped. I got sick of interviews that start off with polls, followed up with what some hack said about having a bad week or other and nothing about policy. I mean, if the purpose is to inform the viewer how do they think any of this does that. Without looking it up, I guess it's the really smart 'sweet young thing' that covered the Supreme Court and filled in for others.... Now I got it, Shannon Bream?
