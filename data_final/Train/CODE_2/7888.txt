BREAKING: Rep. Lamar Smith Demands Interview With Stonetear aka Paul Combetta

conservative treehouse ^ | 9-20-16

Posted on by doug from upland

Hillary Clintons IT technician Paul Combetta has been confirmed by all reasonable inquiry to be online user stonetear as originally discovered by Katica. The Clinton camp is scrambling and took the day off today in a transparent attempt to come up with a coordinated strategy. Today, the House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith is demanding answers:

(Left) Paul Combetta aka stonetear, (Right) Katica Specifically, Chairman Smith is demanding an interview with Paul Combetta to get answers to the myriad of questions which surfaced yesterday as an outcome of the Stonetear discovery. Two Platte River Network (PRN) officials Paul Combetta and Bill Thornton, plead the Fifth Amendment last week when subpoenaed to testify about Hillary Clintons server set-up before the House Oversight Committee. Originally, Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) demanded transcribed interviews with seven Platte River Networks employees in July 2016, but was rebuffed. However, yesterdays reports an outcome of Katicas research that Combetta was specifically asking for on-line assistance to modify emails for a VERY VIP client prior to extraction from the Platte River Network server system, have led Representative Smith to demand the interviews be scheduled by Friday of this week:

I want to take out a life insurance policy on “stonetear” with me as the beneficiary.

Crooked Comey directed Combetta to coverup for

Peter Comey (brother and auditor of Clinton Foundation). Then Comey and Clinton murdered witnesses. The FBI, could not care since they let Islamic terrorists

free en masse from Boston, to Florida, to New York,

to California.

To: doug from upland

Let me see if I understand this. The Congressional Commitee wants to hear the guy explain himself. But the DOJ grants him inpmmunity and he disappears. I thought you gave immunity so people WOULD TALK. Not to help SHUT THEM UP. Maybe it’s just me.

And that is why the FBI gave him immunity. When Trump wins, he must clean out the Justice Department and FBI

starting with the hack Comey.

stonetear would be prudent to use a private personal protection team. WITSEC doesn't exactly have a good reputation protecting witness plus someone with Hillary's connections would know to check there first.



To: doug from upland

If he did not reveal this information as part of the immunity agreement, they should be able to get it nullified by a judge unless they were appointed by a dem. Then Combetta should be immediately arrested, by order of Congress if necessary. Then we just need a few honest people at the FBI willing to question him. Sadly, that’s the toughest part.

To: wastoute

Whatever immunity deal Combetta had has pretty much been ripped to shreds by the latest disclosures When you get criminal immunity, you spill all the beans and don't hold anything back or you could really be screwed The DOJ most likely intentionally wrote the immunity deal to shield Combetta from any potential prosecution while shielding Hillary from any claims that she personally ordered any destruction of evidence His lies and omissions of critical details probably automatically destroy his immunity agreement and the immunity agreement does not extend to these new revelations Combetta is really screwed and his life may actually be in danger

Why did he feel it was necessary to write VERY VIP? Seems a bad mistake or a desire to get caught. Undoubtedly, the former.

Arrest them or shut up.



To: aynrandfreak

Mike Cernovich, who is an attorney says this new revelation about Combetta is outside of the immunity deal he struck. How come all this email stuff isn’t RICO or Obstruction of Justice?

Is it because Comey’s brother has ties to the Clinton Foundation? Or that they are all above the law because they are Criminal Elites?

Oh, it’s on baby...and poor tired old Hillary is about to have stroke knowing that she’ll be spending her golden years in the hoosegow...

To: doug from upland

Would a DOJ immunity deal extend to cover a congressional investigation? Doesn’t seem like it would, and certainly not for new information. Personally, I think anyone being paid directly or indirectly by the government for work should be jailed for taking the 5th to avoid answering questions about that work.

To: wastoute

In the Obama administration things like issuing Executive Priveledge claims to protect a US AG (Eric Holder) from facing felony perjury prosecution, as well as use of immunity to prevent people FROM talking in order to protect these criminals, is how our justice system has been perverted.

Trump needs to fire Comey asap.

The Americans Anonymous twitter feed is showing how in his testimony, Combatta said that he did not save the e-mails as a pdf file, but in his Reddit posting, he said he had it as a pdf. https://twitter.com/ANONAMERICANHQ/status/778407381701189632

#30 Oops. Comey said lying to them is bad. Let’s see what he meant by how they deal with him.... My bet.....they fill his pockets with cash and send him on a 10 year European Vacation. Unavailable to Congress of course. Or he is found in Fort Mercy Park...

Why does everyone here believe he Violated his Immunity Agreement??????? I think he told ALL OF THIS to Corrupt James Comey, Head of the FBI, US Attorney in charge of Whitewater where Every Last Parson involved went to PRISON, Except the Clinton’s

The only way he will talk is if he becomes the fall guy and is prosecuted. We don’t know what kind of immunity he was given nor do we know if the FBI was aware of this new information. He will talk if he is pressured by the FBI and DOJ. How brazen will the FBI and the DOJ be in protecting Clinton? Time for a special prosecutor.

rumor is he is talking
