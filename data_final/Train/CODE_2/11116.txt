Amidst tweets from Bollywood celebs hoping and praying for the end of evil in the country on Dussehra, Swara Bhaskar, an actor known for speaking her mind, hoped for the death of evil thoughts. The actor took to Twitter and talked about how actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui was not allowed to perform in a local Ramleela in his hometown. The tweet read, “This #Dussehra may v rise above the pathetic mentality that disallows a Muslim artist from participating in a #Ramleela performance. #nawaz.”

In another tweet, she added, “This #Dussehra may we rise above the demon within us: the demon of hatred, stupidity, bigotry & blind superstition. Burn Proto-fascism.” The post is in response to an event that took place recently. Nawazuddin was asked to pull out of the Ram Leela programme in his hometown Budhana in Uttar Pradesh after members of Shiv Sena reportedly raised objections as he is a Muslim. Earlier, even Deepika Padukone responded to this situation saying that the society needs to be “sensitive” to people. When asked about her opinion on the incident, Deepika told a TV channel, “I think as a society, in general, we need to be more inclusive and sensitive to people and situations.”
