Francis: Sexual Morality Determined Case-by-Case, Even for Transgender

The National Catholic Reporter ^ | 10/2/16 | Joshua J. McElwee

Posted on by marshmallow

Pope Francis has said that Catholics must discern difficult situations of sexual morality on a case-by-case basis, even when presented with a person who is considering or has had gender reassignment surgery.

In a lengthy press conference aboard the papal flight back to Rome Oct. 2 after a weekend visit to Georgia and Azerbaijan, the pope said "you must take things as they come" and give time to accompany and discern individually with the various situations people are facing.

Francis recounted a meeting at the Vatican he had last year with a Spanish transgender man who had written to the pontiff to describe his own case and had asked for a personal encounter together.

"She is a young woman who suffered much because she felt like a young man," the pope explained. "She felt like a young man, but she was physically a young woman."

The woman, Francis said, had undergone gender reassignment surgery and had then married a woman. "He wrote me a letter saying that, for him, it would be a consolation to come [see me] with his wife," the pope said, clarifying: "He that was her but is he."

The pope said that during the meeting the transgender man spoke of his experience in his parish in Spain, where a younger priest had recently replaced his former pastor, who had turned 80.

"When the new pastor would see him, he would shout to him from the sidewalk: 'You will go to Hell.'" Francis said. "But when the old pastor would come find him, he asked: 'How long has it been since you confessed? Come and confess so you can have communion.' "

"Do you understand?" the pope asked the journalists aboard the flight. "Life is life and you must take things as they come."

Francis said. "But when the old pastor would come find him her, he asked: 'How long has it been since you confessed? Come and confess so you can have communion.' " Why confess if the penitent has no remorse and has full intent to continue in her mortal sins and not ammend her life?

Wow, Frankie, I “feel like” the owner of a harem of 30 young beauties, rather than a 69 year old man married for 48 years. 1) Will you “Determined Case-by-Case” what applies to me?

2) Should I change my name to Bill Clinton and get a Free Pass from the Pres also?

3) Or should I just grow up and honor my vows?

3b) and learn from a lifetime of observation of others that while Promiscuity appears to bring momentary excitement it does not provide lasting joy or peace in old age.

I would caution everybody against taking Fishwrap headlines at face value. They totally omitted the "Sin is sin" quote and relegated the call to confession to the bottom of the page: confession entails confession of sin; absolution requires repentance. Don't count on the Reporter (Fishwrap) to tell you that, even if Pope Francis does. ` `

Sorry, but the example he used clearly indicated the woman was living in sin with another woman. According to Pope Francis, the priest who was concerned for her soul was the "bad" one. (And I don't for one minute believe the story; it sounds like a typical homosexual fraud.) The "good" priest was only concerned about how long it had been since the unrepentant sodomite had been to confession so she could go to Communion. Francis's use this typical Jesuit false dichotomy confers Papal approval of sodomy. Another day, another scandal.

Would God hold a mental illness against these gay people? Are they all mentally ill, or do they just choose to do wrong? And if our spiritual leaders believe they are mentally ill, let them say so.

“Life is life and things must be taken as they come. Sin is sin. Inclinations or hormonal imbalances cause many problems and we need to be careful when claiming all cases are the same: we need to embrace and study each case, accompany the person, discern and integrate them.” Quote as reported from Vatican Insider for those who question the headline here. http://www.lastampa.it/2016/10/03/vaticaninsider/eng/the-vatican/this-is-how-i-as-pope-welcome-homosexual-people-and-transsexuals-xcDn46kAkYW2xSiTEM85OL/pagina.html

"Would God hold a mental illness against these gay people?" The problem is that gay people have rejected Gods grace to repent and turn their lives around. Note that 1 Corinthians 6-9-11 warns, Do not be deceived about sexual immorality, that people who practice it will not inherit the kingdom of God.

Looks like neither the elderly priest nor the elderly pope have stressed "repentance". Pope Francis meeting with woman who underwent sex-change surgery (to right of pope) and her 'wife' (to left of pope.)

I don’t disagree with you and they also parade their sins. I mostly feel bad for the molested ones that went gay. About half try to kill themselves as well, so I don’t know why they are called gay when they are not often happy.

The Pope once again asserts his knowledge of God's word over that of Scripture. Who should we believe? A South American Jesuit Liberation Theology devotee...or the Apostle Paul? Frankie is killing the arguments against Sola Scriptura...and he hasn't even gotten started.

Agreed. Sin is a choice. But following that choice does lead to mental and physical illness. There is only One Cure.

And also from the Vaitcan Insider: For a person to have this inclination, or this option or those who change sex, is one thing. It is quite another to teach according to this line at school, in order to change peoples mentality. This is what I call ideological colonisations. Uh-oh...so much for Francis being against sex changes. His main concern is ideological colonizations: school indoctrination.

Little or no evidence? Let me give you a couple of examples: Pope Benedict XVI agreed to meet with Nancy Pelosi, but Benedict refused to give her a photo op with him. Pope Francis was introduced to Kim Davis, a defender of traditional marriage, during his visit to the U.S. It is reported that he was furious at this surprise and no photos of him and Kim Davis, if any were taken, have been released. Francis however has no problem greeting and posing for photos with homosexual "married" couples.

“This man loves the whole world,” Neria [the she/he] says of Pope Francis. “I think there’s not — in his head, in his way of thinking, discrimination against anyone. I’m speaking about him, not the institution.” Catholic doctrine holds that sex change procedures do not change a person’s gender in the eyes of the church. “But if this Pope has a long life, which all of his followers hope,” Neria says, “I think things will change.” http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/30/living/pope-transgender-man/

In its description of actual papal words and acts, the article shows only what Pope Francis has been saying all along: welcome, accompaniment, inclusion of sinners. You can argue that this is a wrongheaded pastoral strategy -— “Those sheep need to be smacked upside the head! What does he think that papal crozier is for?!”—— call it sentimental treacle, call it Pollyanna fudge-— but it’s not moral heresy. Clasping unclean lambs to one’s bosom is not moral heresy. For that, look to paragraphs 83, 156, 159, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 304, and 311 of Amoris Laetitia.

Clasping unclean lambs and delivering them to the wolves is not pastoral.

“Delivering to the wolves” is not pastoral, but warmly recommending Confession of sin is pastoral, and that’s what Pope Francis -— according to this article -— used as his illustration of the proper pastoral response.

Are you kidding? Francis has even said we don't have to confess sins of which we are too embarrassed. If someone comes to you and feels something must be removed from him, but perhaps he is unable to say it, but you understand its all right, he says it this way, with the gesture of coming. First condition. Second, he is repentant. If someone comes to you it is because he doesnt want to fall into these situations, but he doesnt dare say it, he is afraid to say it and then not be able to do it. But if he cannot do it, ad impossibila nemo tenetur. And the Lord understands these things, the language of gestures. Have open arms, to understand what is inside that heart that cannot be said or said this way somewhat because of shame you understand me. You must receive everyone with the language with which they can speak.

So far into his short pontificate, Pope Francis has attacked three Sacraments: Penance, Holy Communion and Holy Matrimony.

It would be a mistake to over-construe the Pope's statement about the rare instance of a person unable to confess every detail of his sin. He used the word "impossible", and that does not mean difficult, challenging, awkward: "impossible" means, I think, "impossible." It is still, after all, pastorally wrong to make the impossible mandatory. At times--- I can't guess how often --- a priest can't press for an exacting degree of specificity, even in a sacramental Confession. Say a person confesses, with evident repentance, a drunken indecency with a barmaid, but is overwrought with emotion and can't for shame specify what the indecency was. Maybe can't even quite remember. At some point, I suppose, the priest will surely stop pressing for putrid details: he will give up on the Kinsey taxonomy, and just accept the repentance. That's my take on it, anyway.

Amoris laetitia in Para. 298 and attendant footnote #329 as well as in Para. 301 with the claim that living in continence won't work for some folks.... Francis tosses things in the "too hard" basket quite a bit. He did it inin Para. 298 and attendant footnote #329 as well as in Para. 301 with the claim that living in continence won't work for some folks.... A subject may know full well the rule, yet have great difficulty in understanding its inherent values, or be in a concrete situation which does not allow him or her to act differently and decide otherwise without further sin. Is this an example of Francis the merciful....or....is it faithlessness masquerading as mercy? John Paul II, (in Familiaris consortio) on the other hand, has no such doubts: With firm confidence she [the Church] believes that those who have rejected the Lord's command and are still living in this state will be able to obtain from God the grace of conversion and salvation, provided that they have persevered in prayer, penance and charity. IOW, with God's help, all things are possible. Isn't that the Gospel? Likewise, regarding the confessional situation, is it really "shame" that makes confessing certain sins "impossible".....or is it pride masquerading as shame? True shame and repentance makes confessing easier.......pride makes it more difficult. I'll argue this with anyone, including Francis, since over the years, I've confessed pretty much any sin you can imagine, apart from kidnapping and murder!! There is no reconciling #84 of FC and Chapter 8 of AL. Now here's something which really illustrates how far things have gone. Casti Connubii of Pius XI quotes St. Augustine when it says: By conjugal faith it is provided that there should be no carnal intercourse outside the marriage bond with another man or woman; with regard to offspring, that children should be begotten of love, tenderly cared for and educated in a religious atmosphere; finally, in its sacramental aspect that the marriage bond should not be broken and that a husband or wife, if separated, should not be joined to another even for the sake of offspring. This we regard as the law of marriage by which the fruitfulness of nature is adorned and the evil of incontinence is restrained. IOW, rather than staying married and living in continence, Pius XI says....separation is the best way to live in continence. From there we went to John Paul II saying "stay married for the kids but live in continence" and now Francis saying "continence is tough....talk to your priest...there could be a way around it." I'm guessing that Francis has little love for Pius XI. Probably one of those "rigid" "doctors of the law".

At times--- I can't guess how often --- a priest can't press for an exacting degree of specificity, even in a sacramental Confession. A priest can not give absolution unless the sin is understood and confessed; it's not up to the penitent, nor Pope Francis, nor even you, to make the terms of the sacrament.
