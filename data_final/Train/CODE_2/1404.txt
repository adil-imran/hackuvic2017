Asyraf Wajdi: No binding agreement on Saudi aid to victims of Mecca crane tragedy

Asyraf Wajdi said there was no issue of lateness on the handing over of the aid to the families of the seven Malaysian pilgrims who were killed in the tragedy last September. — Picture by Yusof Mat IsaKOTA BHARU, Sept 12 — There is no binding agreement between the Malaysian and Saudi Arabian governments on the time period for handing over of aid contributions to the families of Malaysian victims in the crane collapse tragedy in Makkah last year, said Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department, Senator Datuk Dr Asyraf Wajdi Dusuki.

As such, Asyraf Wajdi said there was no issue of lateness on the handing over of the aid to the families of the seven Malaysian pilgrims who were killed in the tragedy last September as it was only a contribution and not compensation.

“The Saudi Arabian government has taken full responsibility over the incident and has announced that they would give contributions (not compensation). That is why there has been no agreement made between the Saudi and Malaysian governments to ensure that the contributions are channeled swiftly within a certain period.

“Meanwhile, as Malaysian citizens were involved in the tragedy, it is also the Malaysian government’s responsibility to constantly communicate with the Saudi government on the matter,” he told reporters after attending the World #QuranHour programme at the Muhammadi Mosque, here today.

Also present were Karangkraf Media Group Chief Operating Officer, Syahmi Fahim Mohd Fahim, and the State Islamic Development, Dakwah, Information and Regional Relations Committee deputy chairman, Dr Yusnan Yussof.

According to the Saudi Press Agency, the King of Saudi Arabia, Salman Abdulaziz Al Saud, who is the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, had instructed for a payment of SR1 million (RM1.14 million) to be given to the families of pilgrims who were killed and victims who became permanently disabled and SR500,000 for each injured pilgrim. — Bernama
