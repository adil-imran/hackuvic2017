The Supreme Council for Shari’a in Nigerian has said that the activities of the members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), also known as Shi’ites, are not Islamic and called on the government to implement the report submitted by the Kaduna state Commission of Inquiry to put an end to the sect’s activities.

The Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Council, Sheikh Yusuf Sambo Rigachikun and Sheikh Muhammad Suleiman, spoke yesterday in Kaduna after a seminar organised to enlighten Muslims on the activities of the Shia. They said the seminar was meant to highlight the ‘dangerous activities’ of the Shi’ites and to also caution the Northern chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) about their speech in which they called on Christians to arm themselves against Muslims.

“We are trying to enlighten the Muslims to know that Shia is not Islam, what they are preaching is not Islam, they abuse the companions, the wives and the followers of the holy prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) which shows that they are against Islam,” they said. They added that even in Iran, there is no way the Chief of Army Staff would be passing and members of the Shi’ites will block the road. They called on the government to implement the white paper submitted by the Kaduna state Commission of Inquiry, adding that the Shia were wrong and the soldiers were only doing their work.Commenting on the call by Northern CAN that Christians take up arms against Muslims, they said, “The Christians should know that Nigeria belongs to all of us, we are all Nigerians. We should try to live in peace and harmony, so saying that every Christian should go and arm himself is very wrong and not in the interest of peace.”Meanwhile, members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria have claimed that security operatives were planning to attack those among them trekking to Abuja to demand release of their leader, Sheikh Ibrahim Zakzaky.Daily Trust gathered that Shi’ite youth commenced trekking to Abuja from Zaria sometime last week to demand the release of Zakzaky who has been in detention since December 2015.The Shi’ites in a statement signed by the President of the Media Forum of the movement, Ibrahim Musa, ‎said, “The sinister plan shows that the unsuspecting youths will be attacked by some unscrupulous security operatives as they approach Abuja and some weapons will be claimed to have been found on them. These security agents will then rush to town to accuse the Islamic Movement of planning to launch an attack on the capital. We will like to inform the general public that these young men and women are peaceful in all their actions.”
