Kansas State University student Hunter Jobbins got sweet, sweet revenge after someone broke into his car to steal a Kit-Kat last week. After a photo of the robber's note went viral, snagging more than 180,000 retweets and 480,000 likes, as well as inspiring several memes, Kit-Kat stepped in, offering to replace his stolen treat. And then some.

The company stuffed his car with 6,500 Kit-Kat bars, according to a representative for the brand. Rather than backstroke through his sea of chocolates, Scrooge McDuck-style, Jobbins turned it into a candy free-for-all, inviting students-and anyone around-to grab a bar.

I'm the type of person that when I see food lying around-I want it. It doesn't matter if I'm actually hungry, or if it's even an appropriate time to eat that food (do I want a piece of chocolate cake at 10 a.m.? Hell yeah, I do). If it's there, uneaten, and looks at least mildly appetizing, that animalistic instinct kicks it and it is mine. So I can totally relate to the sentiment of this handwritten note that's going viral.

Kansas State University student Hunter Jobbins had his car broken into over the weekend, and as crappy as that sounds, the reason why is actually pretty hilarious. Apparently the burglar saw a Kit-Kat bar in the cup holder, found the car unlocked, and went in for the candy. He didn't take anything else, though, or like vandalize the car or anything cray-he just needed his chocolate wafer fix. And had the balls to admit it. Guess there's no such thing as going too far when candy is involved.

Left my car for maybe 15 minutes in front of the dorms and I come back to this. College man pic.twitter.com/KlDx5BtXLX - Hunter Jobbins (@jabbins) October 30, 2016

Jobbins Tweeted out a photo of the note that the Kit-Kat thief left, and naturally, it's getting shared like crazy. It's already popped up on several Instagram meme accounts, and has been retweeted more than79,000 times and liked over 200,000 times.

Moral of the story: Never leave your car unlocked when there are valuables inside.
