Speaking at the World Energy Congress in Istanbul, the Russian president said that limiting production was the "only way" to stabilise the oil market which has suffered from a long-standing supply glut.

"Russia is prepared to join joint measures limiting production and calls on other exporting countries to do the same," Mr Putin said, according to an English translation by AFP.

Amrita Sen, a chief oil analyst at Energy Aspects, said Russia's commitment to joining a potential Opec deal "has a clear motivation" in coordinating with Opec, given that the Russia's economy has suffered from low oil prices.

"With another 0.45 mb/d (million barrels per day) of new projects due to start-up in Q4 16, the country will be committed to ensuring higher prices and the global rebalancing, which any co-ordinated action will speed up," Ms Sen said.
