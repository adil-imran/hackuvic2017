Anambra State government has said it is collaborating with the Nigeria Erosion and Watershed Management Project (NEWMAP) to provide palliatives for communities ravaged by erosion.

This collaboration followed reports of erosion and flooding sites, which endangered the affected communities.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that residents of Urunabbo in Enugu-Ukwu, Njikoka Local Government, had lamented the destruction of 100 homes and displacement of over 500 residents by flood and erosion.

The community spoke when a team of NEWMAP visited the erosion site to evaluate and monitor the situation.

A community leader, Mr. Emmanuel Nwadinigwe, said residents tried in vain to control the erosion at the initial stage through planting of bamboo and Melina trees.

“We appeal to governments through the NEWMAP to assist us and save our history and livelihood.”

Speaking to NAN, State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) Executive Secretary Chief Paul Odenigbo said the agency would visit the affected communities to assess the devastation.

He wondered why such communities had not reported their plight to SEMA.

Odenigbo said: “The report we got about the erosion challenge and threat to life and property is serious. We shall visit these sites to see how we can assist.”

NEWMAP’s Project Coordinator in Anambra State Mr. Mike Ivenso, who noted that the Enugu-Ukwu site was one of four sites approved by the World Bank, said bidding for the job had been opened.

He told NAN that other sites were in Ikenga Ogidi, Nnewi Ichi, Ire Obosi and Ojoto of 960 geo-referenced erosion sites.

Ivenso said Enugu-Ukwu erosion measured two kilometres and covered about 70.5 hectares, resulting in the erosion of farmlands and access roads, forcing residents to abandon their homes.

He said the call by Governor Willie Obiano that erosion in Anambra be declared a state of emergency was valid.

The project coordinator said four sites under recovery, including Amachalla, St Thomas/Neros Plaza, both in Awka South, Ommagba Onitsha and Abagana in Njikoka were at completion stages of between 50 and 90 per cent.

The people of Amachlla village in Awka South where NEWMAP intervened hailed the agency.

A resident, Mrs. Florence Anigbogu, said she vacated her home in 2011 when erosion almost swept it away.

She said she returned early this year after the bio-remediation project of NEWMAP recovered the land.

Mrs. Anigbogu praised the government and its lead agency, pledging that the community will be more environmental-friendly
