Third shipment of goods for Venezuela

By Sasha Harrinanan Tuesday, September 6 2016

A THIRD shipment of locally- manufactured goods is due to be sent to Venezuela later this month, following the visit to this country by a delegation from the South American nation.

The update on the US$50 million revolving fund thats being used by Venezuela to pay for basic food items and manufactured goods from TT was provided yesterday morning by Trade and Industry Minister Paula Gopee- Scoon.



Following the initial shipments in July 2016, discussions have been ongoing between Venezuelas procurement company Corpovex and TT, in preparation for a third shipment of goods, Gopee-Scoon said. Just last week, a Venezuelan team returned to Port-of-Spain to negotiate a second three-month contract for the purchase of locally manufactured goods. The minister said these items include food and personal hygiene products, previously negotiated, which will now be expanded to include a few new products as well as new suppliers following negotiations and factory site visits.



This shipment is expected to take place by mid-September. We are very pleased with the collaboration with our partners from Venezuela and the trading arrangement which has progressed to the benefit of both sides; this resulting from firm commitments made between Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley and Venezuelas President Nicolas Maduro, during the latters visit to TT in May this year, she said.



Gopee-Scoon noted that her ministry, together with and the TT Manufacturers Association, will continue to have oversight of the arrangement and provide support during the process.



It is expected, however, that the Governments involvement in the business negotiations and logistics will be reduced as the parties adopt more traditional private sector trading arrangements. Gopee-Scoon spoke about the TT-Venezuela trade deal while delivering remarks at the launch of the Oxford Business Groups second annual economic review of this country, The Report: Trinidad and Tobago 2016, at the Hyatt Regency, Port-of-Spain.
