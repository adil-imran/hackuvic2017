Are Jews who refuse to renounce Israel being excluded from "progressive" groups?

Hard left activists are trying to exclude Jews who do not renounce Israel from "progressive" organizations.

Last year, Rabbi Susan Talve, a longtime activist on race issues in the St. Louis area was told that her advocacy for Israel was incompatible with the objectives of Black Lives Matter: "Solidarity from Ferguson to Palestine has become a central tenet of the movement" she was informed, because "Israeli and U.S. state oppression are deeply interconnected." Similarly, a student who attended a Black Lives Matter rally at Northwestern University last year was told "you support Israel, so you cannot also support us."

Recently, that seems to be the response of many of the hard left activists who dominate so-called "progressive" social justice movements.

Over the past several years, progressive Jews, and progressive supporters of Israel have had to come to terms with the reality that those who do not reject Israel and accept Boycott Divestment Sanctions ("BDS") and its unique brand of bigotry are no longer welcome in some progressive circles. And while both Democratic and Republican parties have embraced the importance of the U.S. alliance with Israel, that dynamic is under threat more so than at any point in my lifetime.

For hard left activists, this sort of nuanced position is impossible to accept. Their hostility towards Israel does not stem from any particular Israeli actions or policies. Even if Israel were to withdraw from the West Bank, destroy the security barrier, and recognize Hamas as a legitimate political organization, it would still not be enough. For these radicals, it is not what Israel does; it is about what Israel is: the nation state of the Jewish people--or to use hard-left terminology: an imperialistic, apartheid and genocidal, colonialist enterprise. The recently released Black Lives Matter policy platform offers a perfect example of such extreme rhetoric: it states that U.S. military and economic support for Israel makes American citizens complicit in "the genocide taking place against the Palestinian people."

The Jews who support leftwing causes really need to wake up before they discover that they are being shipped off to a prison camp.

“The Jews who support leftwing causes really need to wake up before they discover that they are being shipped off to a prison camp.” Or whatever people like ISIS have in store for them. There have been some pretty atrocious events happening with ISIS in how they kill people. These are the people that Obama and Hillary helped nurture.

ho support leftwing causes really need to wake up before they discover that they are being shipped off to a prison camp. I have had many Jewish friends over the years. Many people who call themselves Jews and are progressive, are not ones to learn from history.....I don't understand how so many brilliant people, in so many ways, can be so stupid when it comes to self preservation. Then they shake their heads ‘why’ as they are herded into cattle cars

These secular Israel-hating Jews are a disgrace to America and a disgrace to their own people, yet they have the chutzpah to send out appeals for financial support for their special “Jewish” causes, whining about persecution, yada, yada. Screw all of those Democ-RAT bastards. And they also use gullible Christian groups to push their anti-American programs. SPIT!

Jews and Christians do not join such Satanic groups. Period. Renegades and atheists and fallen- away lost souls might join such evil cultic conspiracies. The question should be: how soon can they be banned under sedition, RICO, treason, and other laws?

Most American Jews have been straddling the fence for 50 years, being pro-Israel when its good for them and being pro-Socialism as much as possible. But, the Progressive Movement has taken control of their goal of a Glorious Socialist America and part of that Movement’s goals is the eradication of Israel. So, which is more important to each American Jew, because each one needs to decide: a Jewish state on the ground previously occupied by the Israel of the Hebrew bible or a Socialist State in the New World that replaces the nominally Christian USA? Like it has become for all of us, this election is a final decision for the future of America and the world. If Hillary wins, there is no “next election to set things right”.

They won’t. If they haven’t discovered that by now, they never will. The self-hate is obvious

“The Jews who support leftwing causes really need to wake up before they discover that they are being shipped off to a prison camp.” I think that the truth of the matter is “Jews” who don’t support Israel are only people who though they came into this word via a Jewish mother, aren’t really Jews, they are just “passing” as one.

Seems so. Why are they so self-destructive in their political alliances here? Enemy of my enemy (Christians) at work here, too? Miserealites.

Jews who don’t support Israel and who support Hillary are Capos/Kapos. They will be judged by God and found quite lacking. Eternity won’t be pleasant for them, IMO.

Back in the day, when Israel was the “underdog” and had successful collective farms, they were the darling of the left. But now, after winning wars, becoming giants in worldwide invention, industry, biotech, and electronics, they are successful “capitalists” and are no longer the darling of the left. Not to mention that they are Jews (!) and the left hates Jews. So there ya go.

Just take note of Hitlery’s comments about Jews!! What sane Jew would ever support a witch like that?

You’d think with a recent history of 6 million killed and the Muslim world out to do them in, they’d be the first ones to fight tyranny and the political worship of false idols

Just how long will it take for Alan Dershowitz to smell the coffee and HIMSELF wake up to his continuing to stick with the Democratic Party, which abandoned him decades ago in favor of the enemies of the U.S. and Israel? He’s been whining like this for decades, yet he voted for Obama, I believe twice! He is a poster boy for cognitive dissonance.

The BLM is nothing more than a collection of knuckle walking thugs and halfwits manipulated by outsiders such as Muzzlimes and Commies to do their bidding. Not a very hard job either—with a few catchy slogans and a catchy beat to them, they’d follow you to hell and back, shaking their fat a@@es to it. Think of these bigoted hypocrites as “The Clan With the Tan”.
