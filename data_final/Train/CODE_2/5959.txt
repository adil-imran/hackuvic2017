Largest Voter Fraud Investigation in Texas History Underway in Tarrant County

empowertexans ^ | Oct 6, 2016 | Ross Kecseg

Posted on by dila813

A massive investigation is underway in Tarrant County as law enforcement officers from the Texas Attorney Generals Office investigate a vote-harvesting scheme alleged to involve as many as 20,000 ballots.

Last month, Texas Scorecard reported that Tarrant County Elections administrator Frank Phillips disclosed the AGs office had launched a criminal investigation into voting abnormalities inside Tarrant County.

The investigation was the result of a complaint filed by Aaron Harris, of Direct Action Texas, an organization that also uncovered significant errors in Hill Countys primary election results.

Today, Harris confirmed that AG investigators have been spotted on the ground in Tarrant County interviewing witnesses. In a statement released online, Harris claimed the investigation is into a vote harvesting scheme involving as many as 20,000 ballots.

voterfraud

This same thing was described by my sister as happening to my father, the nursing home drove everyone to the polls and the same nurse who was the union steward took each one of them into the voting booth one by one and voted for them. For those that couldn't physically go to the polls, they assisted them filling in absentee ballots. Folks, this is where a lot of the dead people voting come from.

Anyone found engaging in election fraud should be given a fair trial - and then hanged by the neck until dead.

They need to make that an option in Texas

Skip the trial and proceed directly to the hanging—Save time.

I know now that this has occurred in at least 3 states. I think this is a widespread conspiracy

Happens every year, and according to the statistics almost nobody ever gets prosecuted.

I don't think that these people are smart enough to have a conspiracy. It's just people with the same interests, acting in the same way. Until punishment is handed out, they'll continue to do it. FReepers have been yelling "Voter Fraud" as long as I've been here. The media has been saying "It doesn't exist", just as long (see the Doonesbury comic from last weekend....). It's just a question of which do you believe, the media or your lyin' eyes? Indiana is currently investigating up to 45,000 votes - there have been articles on FR about it of late. Now, we're looking at 20,000 from Texas. Both are easily enough to swing elections.



To: dila813

So how many fake primary votes went to Ted Cruz? “ducks and runs,,maybe this is sarcasm?”



To: dila813

Tarrant County. Big Surprise.



To: wbill

I think this will continue on until every accepts a national ID card, and there’s some open data across state-lines where you can determine some folks are listed in two or more states. Personally, I’d to see a $10,000 fine automatically assessed (leaving a judge no choice but to assess and collect the money) if a guy is listed and votes in two districts, or participated in voter fraud....for EACH vote. At that point, it might persuade some folks that it’s not worth the trouble.



To: wbill

You don’t think that this could be coordinated through union halls? The one common denominator has been unions in all these cases. Nurse Alliance - SEIU - Service Employees International Union

To: pepsionice

Agree - penalties must be assessed or it’s going to continue to get worse. A light spot is that there seems to be a number of vote fraud investigations happening now. I can only hope there ends up being some consequences - the more severe, the more likely it will reduce. I hope Trump has something to do with the increased fraud investigating activity.

It is an form of coup d’etat. It is treason. It undermines the citizens’ faith in the electoral system. The death penalty is only appropriate. Fines are paid by organizing agencies. Only direct punishment will slow it.



To: dila813

What about Harris Co. (Houston)? It would be comforting to know that the Black dunce, Sheila Jackson Lee, is in Congress only because of voter fraud, rather than having so many stupid Texans voting for this Leftist New Yorker for decades.

The globalists will not be denied. Same same in 2012. We’ve lost control of our once great republic.

To: Noamie

The main purpose behind early voting is so that fewer fraud operators are needed. This is why the Dems scream so loudly when the number of early voting days is reduced. Ignoring absentee balloting - which does at least leave a paper trail - with early voting, one fraudster can drive multiple “voters” to the polls over several days. In contrast, making many hauls on election day increases visibility and raises suspicions.



To: dila813

Sure, absolutely it's possible. I just think that if it were a conspiracy, then sooner or later someone would talk. Either they'd have a change of mind, or would get caught, or get cut out of having a bigger piece of the pie. It's possible to have people working together to achieve the same thing, without a conspiracy. Look at the MSM being in the tank for Hillary.



To: TTFlyer

Is it me, or am I hearing more of these cases in TX, VA, OH, IN. Does that mean there is more of it, or they are doing a better job of finding it this time?



To: VTenigma; All

interesting: virgina we have an acorn organization making fraudulent ballots in fl there are mental homes voting by absentee. (despite fl’s elder abuse and disabled abuse enhancement law) Pennsylvania vote fraud now being investigated. now texas will this mean anything before voting starts? will these groups actually get criminal charges? or will they just throw a few useful idiots under the bus?

A couple of years ago, there was a substantial investigation across several states. As I recall, they found several thousand people that had voted in multiple states. The fix was for states to clean up the voter rolls. That's an easy fix, the question isn't technical, it's political. God forbid that a mistake might be made and someone might need to re-register. Now - if someone moves from FL to MN, and doesn't update their FL registration, is it possible for them to vote in both places? Sure. Is it likely? Well.....depends. I think that where the problem is coming from isn't people intentionally voting in multiple districts. I think that it's from corrupt ballot-counters casting votes for people who haven't voted. How else are some districts getting 100+% voter turnout? I'll need to dig around on FR, see if I can find the articles that talked about this. It was quite a tempest at the time. The MSM squashed back then, it might be a little more interested now.

We saw something of that sort in 2006 when my father-in-law was in a nursing/dementia home. Most barely knew their names. They had a voting booth at the entrance of the home where public and patience could early vote (if memory serves me correctly)...but they had all the patients registered and took them to the front to vote...suggesting they vote all “D”!!!!!!! If we really knew all the fraud and bad tactics going on we’d know we were in a hell ready to break us all. No wonder gun manufactures are having record breaking years!



To: TTFlyer

I don't necessarily think hanging is the solution. Just "fix" the person in some sort of way so that there's absolutely no way possible they'll ever do it again, and make them an example to whomever's thinking of doing it next. :)

“More than a year ago, I predicted that this years vote fraud would be epic, many times the usual level. It looks like I was right. Fortunately, the communists dont have enough capable coordinators to implement fraud on the scale they expect to need. Thank God that Americas enemies on the left are mostly incompetent!” I posted this yesterday, on another vote fraud thread, after posting many other comments on this year’s systematic vote fraud. I expect massive and unprecedented fraud on such a scale that the election results will not believed if the left claims Hillary won. Our federal government will lose its last vestige of legitimacy if the socialists steal this election.

1. What you said. 1. What you said. 2. Mandatory 1 year and 1 day jail sentence - a felony. That would wipe out their ability to ever vote again, to hold a federal or state job, or to hold any position in government. You want this to stop? It has to HURT, BADLY. Also, you need to get a few top-level people who organize this, or who know about it and fail to report it, and give them extended sentences, no possibility of parole.

Look back on my posts and you’ll find that reported MANY times from a Mental retardation facility that the Union people (AFSCME) came into units with ballots and talked to people who have NEVER spoken, made a gesture that indicated “Yes” or “NO” and never came out of a coma. They would come in and say “Do you wanna vote, Sweetie? OK, did you want to vote for Bill Clinton? OK! I’ll just mark this and sign for you. Thank you.”
