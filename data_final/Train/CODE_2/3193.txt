The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) yesterday said that the country currently possesses the capacity to create about $51 billion investment opportunities in the midstream and downstream gas sector.

According to the Corporation, if the existing potentialities are tapped, they can help to achieve the growth phase of the industry.

Group managing director of the NNPC, Dr Maikanti Baru, made this disclosure while delivering a keynote address at the Nigerian Gas Association (NGA) 10th International Conference and Exhibition held in Abuja, yesterday.

Similarly, the minister of state for petroleum resources, Dr Ibe Kachikwu, while delivering a keynote address, said the federal government had completed plans to turn the country into an attractive gas-based industrial nation with a primary focus on meeting local gas demands as well as developing a significant presence in the international market.

Consequently, government is set to introduce a policy that will ensure a strong and rapidly growing LPG market in the country, in addition to setting a target to attain five million tons gas utilisation in the next five years. The country currently utilises about 600,000 tons locally.

Dr Baru, who delivered a paper titled, “New Growth Phase for Gas Business in Nigeria,” posited that about $35.4 billion investment will be required in the gas exploration and production activities, power plant projects, fertiliser plants, virtual pipelines and flare gas commercialisation initiatives.

The GMD added that $16 billion investment will also be needed in the Free Trade Zones (FTZ) infrastructure development and concessioning, port infrastructure, central gas processing facilities, gas transmission, LPG plants, real estate development, pipe milling and local fabrication yards among others.

He further said that some of the key enablers required for the growth of the gas sector include clear definition of boundaries between upstream, midstream and downstream sectors, appropriate pricing structure and guarantees for payment, host communities engagement and conducive environment for investors.

“Beyond growing gas for power sector, there has been a strategic positioning of the sector to support massive gas-based industrialisation. The intent is to position Nigeria as a regional hub for gas-based industries such as fertiliser, methanol, petrochemicals, central processing facilities, etc. The first of this effort is the planned 30 square kilometre gas-based industrial park in Delta State. This will be Africa’s largest purpose-built gas park supporting gas-based industries,” Baru said.

According to him, to bridge the huge gas supply gap, some strategic synergy opportunities for gas development were identified amongst the Joint Ventures (JVs), Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) and independent operators which, when pursued and implemented, will not only bridge the unforeseen long term shortfall in gas supply but will also enable the nation to meet its gas aspiration.

The NNPC helmsman further noted that seven key big gas development projects had been identified from the strategic synergy opportunities which can deliver about 3.4 billion cubic feet of gas per day to bridge the foreseen medium term supply gap by 2020.

The theme of the NGA 2016 conference and exhibition is: “Nigerian Gas Roadmap and Its Potential for Regional and Global Influence: Its Implementation, Challenges, Opportunities and New Way Forward.”

OPEC Says Supply Deal On Course As Oil Hits 1 Month Low

Oil dropped to a one-month low after weekend talks between OPEC and other major producers failed to yield concrete details on an accord to reduce the global crude surplus.

This happened just as the secretary-general of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Mohammed Barkindo, said the organisation and other major oil producers are “on course” to deliver a deal next month that will temper the global oversupply.

Crude fell as much as 3.6 per cent in New York. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ended talks with non-members such as Russia and Brazil on Saturday without making any supply commitments, Brazil’s Oil and Gas Secretary Marcio Felix said.

The previous day, OPEC still hadn’t resolved how to allocate among its members an output cut announced last month. Iraq has joined Iran, Nigeria and Libya in seeking to be excluded from any curbs.

Oil has fluctuated near $50 a barrel amid uncertainty over whether OPEC can implement the first supply cuts in eight years at its official November meeting.

West Texas Intermediate for December delivery dropped $1.60, or 3.3 per cent, to $47.10 a barrel at 1:47 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract touched $46.94 earlier, the lowest since September 29. Total volume traded was 5.3 per cent below the 100-day average. Prices are down 2.3 per cent this month.

All of OPEC’s 14 members as well as erstwhile rivals, such as Russia, are committed to finalising the agreement which is to be completed when the group meets on November 30, Barkindo said yesterday in a Bloomberg Television interview.

Even Iraq, which has demanded an exemption from supply caps and vowed to increase production, is willing to play its part, he said.

Oil’s rally above $50 a barrel has faltered amid doubts that the cartel will make the supply cuts it pledged in Algiers last month as Iran, Iraq, Libya and Nigeria all seek to be excluded from the deal, while non-members such as Russia gave equivocal signals of their support.

At talks in Vienna last week, Barkindo warned of the consequences if producers do not follow through on their agreement to reduce supply.

OPEC made “significant progress” when technical experts from member nations gathered in the Austrian capital on Friday to work on details of the deal, and again when they met the following day with representatives from Azerbaijan, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Oman and Russia, Barkindo said.

“It’s too early to say how much these non-member producers may be willing to cut.

“Come November 30, we are optimistic that we are going to get the required supply cut that will go a long way in re-balancing this market,” Barkindo said.

He insisted Iraq was “committed to the implementation of the ‘Algiers accord’ and that he was “confident that our non-OPEC friends will also contribute.”

OPEC had agreed on September 28 in the Algerian capital that it would reduce output to a range of 32.5 million to 33 million barrels a day – the first output cut in eight years – to hasten the rebalancing of the oil market.

The decision, which scrapped a two-year strategy of producing without restraint, would mean curbing the group’s output by as much 900,000 barrels a day.

Still, initial signs from the weekend’s discussions weren’t encouraging, with representatives from Brazil and Kazakhstan outlining plans to increase production on Saturday after talks concluded without any joint agreement.

While Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has pledged to cooperate, he has been vague about whether the country will trim output or just freeze production at September’s post-Soviet record.

Nonetheless, OPEC is “satisfied” with Russia’s involvement in the process and considers the issue of reducing or simply capping as “mere semantics,” Barkindo said.

On October 28, OPEC’s technical forum struggled to agree on how to allocate individual cuts amid disputes over the role Iran and Iraq ought to play, delegates said.

On Sunday, Iraq disclosed more data on its oil fields to prove that OPEC is underestimating the amount of crude it was producing.

While Iran, Iraq and Venezuela have all disputed OPEC’s assessments of their output, such differences would not derail the accord, Barkindo said.

Iraq, which faces difficulties in collecting output data because of security challenges, is making progress in reconciling its figures with OPEC’s, the OPEC scribe said, adding that reports that some countries want to be excluded from output limits will not prevent the deal either.

“The decision in Algiers was an all-inclusive one,” he said. “The issue of exemption does not arise.”
