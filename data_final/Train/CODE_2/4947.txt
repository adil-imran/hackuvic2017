CEBU, Philippines - An alleged hit man of suspected drug lord Alvaro Alvaro alias Barok was killed in a shootout with the law enforcers Friday morning in Pulangyuta, Barangay Looc, Danao City.

Christian Baton alias Ekit, resident of the place, reportedly shot it out with the operatives of Danao City Anti-Illegal Drugs Unit past 9 a.m. after he noticed that the person he was transacting with was an undercover police officer.

Danao City Police Station chief Senior Inspector Alejandro Batobalonos said Baton had been placed under surveillance since he surrendered last month during the "Oplan Tokhang."

Batobalonos said the suspect continued his illegal drug business even after he signed an undertaking with the police and promised to stop his illegal activity.

On Friday, the police conducted a buy-bust operation against Baton using P200 marked money. During the transaction, Baton discovered that he was dealing with a police decoy, prompting him to draw his 9 millimeter pistol and fired at the policemen.

Batobalonos said they were forced to return fire hitting Baton in different parts of his body resulting in his death. The police tried to save Baton by rushing him to the Provincial Hospital in Danao City but he was declared dead on arrival.

The police recovered Baton's 9mm pistol as well as one medium pack of shabu worth P36,816. The law enforcers also recovered the P200 buy-bust money.

Baton is believed to be among those responsible for the strafing of the Danao City Police Station earlier this month after Barok's brother, Medz, and another cohort were also killed during police operation.

Barok is now detained at the Cebu Provincial Detention Center after he surrendered to the National Bureau of Investigation in Bohol following the death of Jeffrey Diaz alias "Jaguar." Barok is said to be an underling of Jaguar in the illegal drugs trade.

Batobalonos said they now have the identities of all those responsible for the strafing but refused to give their names pending police operation.

He said they remain on red alert after the incident and after receiving death threats. (FREEMAN)
