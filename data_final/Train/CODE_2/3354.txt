IPOH, Sept 8 — The primary school teacher, who was allegedly assaulted by two narcotics police officers here on August 30, has been given three weeks leave to seek medical and emotional help.

A close relative said the teacher had returned to his hometown in Kota Baru to seek traditional treatment for his injuries and counselling.

“He is traumatised. Now whenever a motorcycle nears him, his heart will pound hard,” said the relative, who declined to be named.

In the 6.30pm incident, Sheikh Ashroff Umar, 35, was said to have been flagged down by two men on motorcycles shortly after he left SK Bukit Sapi but refused to stop for fear the men were robbers.

He was, however, cornered by the duo, who turned out to be narcotics officer from the Lenggong police station, and had his left arm broken during the scuffle.

A 21-second video recording of Sheikh Ashroff’s arrest has since gone viral on social media.

He could be heard repeatedly telling the plainclothes policemen they had the wrong person as one of them had him in a headlock and another handcuffed him.

Yesterday, one of the officers was remanded for four days at the Pengkalan Hulu magistrate's court to assist in investigations.

State education committee chairman Datuk Mohd Amin Zakaria said it was unacceptable for the teacher to be treated in such a manner.

“He was at the school to help Year Six pupils prepare for their Ujian Penilaian Sekolah Rendah,” he told reporters here.

Amin said doctors at Kuala Kangsar Hospital confirmed Sheikh’s left arm was broken when he went to seek treatment on August 31.

“A police report has been lodged at Kota Baru,” he said, adding that Sheikh Ashroff was also asked to identify the policemen who roughed him up at the Gerik district police station.

Sheikh Ashroff’s friend, Azlan Madeli, said he was shocked to learn that Sheikh Ashroff was roughed up by police.

“He is a nice person who will offer his help to people,” said the 54-year-old retired serviceman.

“He is a respected teacher and he never associates himself with any criminal activities.”

Azlan, who has known Sheikh Ashroff for more than 10 years, said police should not use brutality when arresting a person.

“They should conduct a proper investigation before making any arrest,” he said.

State police chief Datuk Seri Abdul Rahim Hanafi said on Tuesday the case was being investigated under Section 325 of the Penal Code for voluntarily causing grievous hurt.

“We will wrap up the investigations as soon as possible,” he said.
