[Vanity] It is imperative that you vote straight Republican ticket in November

EEE | 10 OCTOBER 2016 | EEE

Posted on by Extremely Extreme Extremist

I made this point on this thread here, but a vanity is more preferable.

If you are not voting for down-ticket Republicans, you are giving the Democrats a chance to retake control of Congress.

Now, this is not a defense of the utter fecklessness of Congressional Republicans over the last 5.75 years, because Donald Trump IS the end result of this fecklessness from the Republicans, so we did send our message.

If Trump had not been the GOP nominee, I wouldn't even be holding my nose. I simply would not have voted and would have checked out the political process entirely and crawled into a hole with a bottle of liquor like Calvin Coolidge did after Hoover won.

I totally agree with you. I get it. I hate the Republicans in Congress too. Guys like Congressman Joe Heck, a Brigadier Army General who should know better, may have squandered his chance at an easy Senate seat pickup just because he heard man-talk that was probably on par with the stuff he heard in the military, or in the hospitals (Heck is also a physician) where there is frequent gallows humor about the patients.

New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayeotte, a Tea Party darling who has turned into the female version of John McCain, is also in danger of losing her seat as well.

So the supporters of Trump are going to vote for Trump, but many of them will now write in someone else, vote 3rd party, or even vote for the Democrat.

This is wrong on 2 counts:

(1) Unlike the feckless, door mat Congressional Republicans who hold the "majority," Democrats have no qualms about using Congressional powers to the max. And you'll all of a sudden hear the media scream that Trump is abusing the Presidency and needs to be reined in by the very same Congress that the Left disregarded over the last 5.75 years as they used the courts and the Executive Branch to implement their agendas.

All of Trump's initiatives - including hiring more Border Patrol agents and maybe needing more money for the wall - will not be funded by a Rat Congress.

Trump's SCOTUS picks will not be confirmed.

Trump's lower court picks will not even have a committee hearing.

With a Republican Congress, Trump will be in a much better position to pass his agenda. There will also be none of the backscratching and the Republican's lobbyists will have no input. Also, Trump will owe none of these turncoat Republicans who demanded he step down NOTHING. Assuming he wins his Senate seat, guys like Joe Heck will have to get on board the Trump train...or Yucca Mountain will be immediately chosen to store nuclear waste and Trump will endorse and campaign for his primary opponent in 2022.

(2) Keeping Congress in Republican Party hands also keeps Trump honest, at least from the Freedom Caucus and other conservatives. Remember: Trump is not a Constitutional conservative! He is someone who will save America from the internationalists - but we will still have big government here at home. So on the flip side of this, with a Democrat Congress, Trump may have the urge to pull a Schwarzenegger, all but abandoning his agenda and negotiating with the Democrats on theirs (I don't see it happening, but you never know). Those conservatives in Washington will stop or at least exert more state control over some of Trump's big government projects like his support of expanding child care. They'll likely get Trump to turn over more federal power back to the states.

So yes, I don't care if your Republican candidate is a flaming liberal. Hold your nose and vote for him, and keep Congress in Republican's hands!

Absolutely - vote Republican. It’s essential that we keep the House and Senate. Remember, the majority controls committees - like Judiciary. The next generation will be governed by the new Supreme Court.



To: Extremely Extreme Extremist

It’s gonna be tough pulling the level on that sanctimonious Rob Portman. Figure, I can leave it blank or go 3rd party. He’ll still win, but his totals will be lower the the other R’s.

There are a number of races here in Houston where there is no Republican candidate, but there is a Libertarian candidate. In that case I vote for the Libertarian solely for the purpose of denying the Democrat the vote.

The Democratic Party must be crushed, obliterated. See my tagline.

ABSOLUTELY NOT!! You find any republicrat supporting hillary and crush that jack ass. I voted libertarian against a hillary supporting RINO bastard!! Never will I support an anti— again. SCREW THEM!

Agreed and should be obvious. I just posted about how my hatred of ryan cont overshadow holding onto the congress, so the good guys will be better positioned to help Trump.

I agree with this.. take out the phony’s in the next primary— except Paul Ryan— we can sacrifice one seat...



To: Extremely Extreme Extremist

I have NO problem voting for Ron Johnson over Rusty Feingold. And luckily, based on where I now live, that’s the ONLY tough decision I need to make this time around. :)



To: Extremely Extreme Extremist

I don’t want hilary supporting republicrats ever again!! To hell with them . Why vote for a fake Democrat when you can get a REAL Leftist !!

To: madison10

Dont bother. The raging anger has over taken logic. The raging anger is in the tantruming never Trumpers who will not support the will of the GOP voters. Returning the favor to them is a calibrated response and 100% correct. The House is safe. The Senate is gone. They simply won’t support Trump regardless of who controls the body.

Paul Ryan needs to resign now .

He is destroying the ticket.

No GOP must win if Ryan is their speaker. LET THEM REMOVE RYAN OR PERISH.

Frankly, at this point I prefer to see the party of Bush, Ryan, Romney, McCain, Kasich and Graham destroyed forever. If we can’t get anything else positive out of this election, at least we can get that.

(unless you can safely help take out a RINO, safely) The time for that is the primary. So now I must decide whether to vote for the 50% squish RINO congressthing we failed to primary, or vote for the 0% flaming communist leftwing radical demonicRAT. It's a fairly easy choice, really ...



by 23 posted onby NorthMountain (Hillary Clinton: corrupt unreliable negligent traitor)

To: bleach

We had our chance to take out Portman, McCain, Paul Ryan. It's called the primaries. The primaries are over. We are days away from the general election. Electing Trump and keeping Congress in GOP hands knocks the Democrats out of power, as they are in the minority in states legislatures and Governors as well. We can always primary them in 2018 if they try to stop Trump's agenda. But the beauty is that there will be no Democrats in the majority.



To: Extremely Extreme Extremist

Not Joe Heck

I’m with you. I don’t understand the logic in voting for Trump and doing everything you can to make sure he has no power.

To: Extremely Extreme Extremist

How about we lose Paul Ryan and keep everyone else. Maybe even gain a seat or two. That would send a message.



To: Az Joe

"Yes, more posts like this (unless you can safely help take out a RINO, safely)" If anyone here wants Republicans to SUPPORT and VOTE for PAUL RYAN in Wisconsin's 1st Congressional district, versus the DEMOCRAT, please RAISE YOUR HAND and reply back to me in the AFFIRMATIVE!



To: Extremely Extreme Extremist

I concur. I’m sure The Donald has — or will have — private investigators working on many of these traitors and creeps. A Trump administration is going to need headcount. It’s going to be all hands to the pumps to save this nation — but the ones doing the pumping aren’t going to be the ones steering the ship or setting the sails. They will be down in the bilges sweatin’ and strainin’ while Captain Donald is on the quarterdeck with trusty lieutenants like Rudy and Newt. It would actually be rather pleasant to see Paul Ryan reduced to the status of a back bencher for the last two years of his pathetic political career.



To: Extremely Extreme Extremist

Sorry I ain’t gonna do!! These RINOS have literally made me physically sick to the point that I don’t sleep well thinking about my children and grandchildren futures!! How a freakin Hitlery presidency would destroy their lives!!! I’m on the fence with Cruz and if I feel like it I’ll vote for him then again it depends what my conscience tells me that day! It might be a good day or he might be a bad day depending on my mood will see! Karma !!



To: Extremely Extreme Extremist

We are in far more danger than most people realize. Under the 20th Amendment, the new Congress takes office on January 3 but the new President does not take office until January 20. That means that if Trump is elected President and the Democrats retake the Senate, then Senate Majority Leader Chuckie Schumer will have almost three weeks to push through ratification of all of Obama’s nominees from the Supreme Court down to the district courts and all of the federal agencies and there will not be a damned thing that Trump or the Republican minority will be able to do to stop it. When Harry Reid unilaterally abolished the Senate filibuster for all Presidential appointments except for the Supreme Court the ONLY reason that he left Supreme Court filibusters alone is because there were no Supreme Court vacancies at the time. Chuckie Schumer will unilaterally abolish the Supreme Court filibuster 5 minutes after he takes office. It gets worse. Scalia’s Supreme Court seat is not the only Supreme Court seat at issue. The day after the election, far-left octogenarian Justices Ginsburg and Breyer will announce their retirements if it means that Obama can fill those seats as well. They probably already have the young far-left wing radical replacements picked out. That will mean a far-left wing Supreme Court majority of Obama appointees will be legislating every aspect of our lives for the next 30 years. Be afraid. Be very afraid.

Rob will in for a new 6. 2022-2023. If he won’t back Trump now, why would he back him come January? He’s not been the same since his son came out.

To: WENDLE

ABSOLUTELY NOT!! You find any republicrat supporting hillary and crush that jack ass. Their words doesn't mean anything. It's simply the media ringing the dinner bell triangle. Either they'll lose or if they win they'll no longer have a seat at the table. And that plays into Trump's hands.



To: Extremely Extreme Extremist

Here's what I posted earler on another thread regarding this very issue: I agree with the basic premise of your post. Yes, it really would be better for Trump, when elected, to have a Congress filled with RINOs rather than Democrats. HOWEVER, that said, as exasperating as RINOs are, their FIRST DUTY IS TO HELP GET TRUMP ELECTED!!! Then, if they choose to be a thorn in our side, so be it. This is why I now absolutely refuse to vote for any current "Republican" who actively fails to help Trump win this election. These filthy, vile moral cowards are failing their FIRST DUTY. McCain and his ilk will now NEVER receive my vote.

McCain tweeted that he and his wife will not vote for Trump. So I should reward him with my vote? I think not and I told him so.



To: Extremely Extreme Extremist

There’s no way I’m voting for Traitor RINO Portman. I’m voting for the Independent who is a TRUE Conservative and whose views align with Trump’s...Tom Connors.

“Its essential that we keep the House and Senate.” Why? We gave the House and Senate and they sat on their butts ever since. They made promises they never kept, and they screw us every chance they get.



To: WENDLE

Why vote for a fake Democrat when you can get a REAL Leftist !! Because a real leftist will pull all types of Congressional shenanigans and Trump will become another Nixon. You do not want a Democrat Congress. They will force Trump to become another Schwarzenegger, which will alienate US, or they will portray him as the 2nd coming of Nixon and take him down.



To: lodi90

“The Senate is gone. They simply wont support Trump regardless of who controls the body.” If there is a Monster vote that puts Trump in... His ability to MOVE VOTERS will influence the Republicraps (e) in the Senate. Trump could put pressure on...and make a few deals at the same time ! Over 4-8 years we might get some real CONSERVATIVES to

replace TRAITORS.

Vindictiveness is a sure way to turn people, even allies, against you.

McConnell and Ryan will do all of the above regardless. Your point?



To: Extremely Extreme Extremist

I will, but if he loses, it’s the last time.



To: Bubba_Leroy

Mochell Obama scotus oh crap



To: Extremely Extreme Extremist

It’s certainly not imperative that I vote in any fashion other than that which I choose. I fully expect you to do the same, and we are equals in the voting process.

Not going to happen.

I will vote for Dave Brat.

I will vote for Donald Trump. I WILL NOT VOTE FOR ANY CHEAP LABOR EXPRESS REPUBLICANS.

Im with you. I dont understand the logic in voting for Trump and doing everything you can to make sure he has no power. If the party won’t respect the voters why should the voters respect the party? It’s quite clear now that Amnesty Ryan and the rest of the GOPe prefer Hillary Criminal to GOP voters choice. Turnabout is fair play as they say.



by 48 posted onby lodi90 (Clear choice for Conservatives now: TRUMP or lose)

To: CodeToad

Because we have a better chance of enacting Trump’s agenda, and a better chance of blocking Clinton’s. Consider the committees and who pick and confirms the next Supreme Court Justices. Let’s use our heads. I’ll pose the same question to you as I pose to the NeverTrumps - why do you want any Democrat to win any race?



To: Extremely Extreme Extremist

I can never vote for Paul Ryan or Jeff Flake or other TDS politicians, I could not do it.
