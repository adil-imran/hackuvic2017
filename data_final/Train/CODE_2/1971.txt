Posted on by Hojczyk

Donald Trump, the 2016 GOP presidential nominee, delivered a positive and uplifting message filled with hope and opportunity here at the Great Faith Ministries International church.

In addition to Dr. Ben Carson and Omarosa, Breitbart News accompanied Trump on the trip to Detroit to provide an original and behind-the-scenes look into how he is offering an uplifting message to all Americansincluding the black community.

Maybe, just maybe, the Blacks are going to begin to figure things out with respect to the RATS. These images are great!

More like Hope Solo in the black community. Still the rats should be worried.

The optics on a ballsy move like reeealy have to make the Dems nervous. Hillary: AWOL. Trump: In DETROIT! Especially paired with, "What have you got to lose?" and, exposing Dem governances and ghettos as nothing but do-nothing dead-end political Plantations.

If Trump can establish his INTEGRITY and “connect” with BOTH the Black and Hispanic communities the show is over for Clinton and the Dems.. REALLY over!

I notice something here. Look at the first picture. See the wrinkles beside Trump’s eye and the squinty look on the other people’s faces? And in the following pictures, like the wrinkles at the corners of Carson’s eyes. Those are not typical politicians’ fake smiles, those are genuine smiles. That’s the look on people’s faces when they actually are smiling. Look at a few pictures of Hillary’s fake campaign smiles. You’ll see the difference. Ignore the lips, look at the eyes. These people like what they see, Trump made some points with these people big time. Dear Washington, America is coming, and they’re bringing Donald J Trump.

Great observations about how genuine Trump is as opposed to her phoniness!!

Hope you’re right that he is resonating and that we the people are about to take back our government.

No. It’s... Hillary: In the Rothschild’s house in Martha’s Vineyard with the Hollywood elite, raising money. Trump: In Detroit with people who need to have the chains of economic oppression lifted. This is how landslides happen.

Yup. Even better.

Uh, That guy just behind Trump’s shoulder, with the lapel pin...... Is he the SS agent that carried Hillaroid’s injection?

Haven’t seen him with the Beast lately, did he get re-assigned to Trump maybe?

Trump is definitely resonating. That’s the only reason he ever made it even halfway through the primaries. People saw him saying the same things they do when they discuss world events around the coffee table, in plain language instead of politispeak, telling the truth about politicians, illegal immigrants, the economy, islamic terrorists, the media, and on and on, and they started both listening and waking up. As more people started telling their friends and neighbors and they started paying attention, Trump got more and more support. Now it’s gone past the tipping point I think. After last week’s visit to Mexico and now this meeting with black church leaders, I’m pretty sure there is no turning back any more. Somebody poke a fork in Hillary, she’s done.

Hillary: In the Rothschilds house in Marthas Vineyard with the Hollywood elite, raising money. I thought Republicans were supposed to be for the rich guys?

In many ways Donald Trump is the 21st Century Ronald Reagan. Hes clear in his message and a threat to the established “order”. As with Trump, Reagan struck a chord with average Americans feeling at the time their government (Jimmy Carter) was inept, unable and maybe even unwilling to represent them. Once the momentum was clear, recalcitrant Republicans got on board the Reagan Train to (two) landslide victories. Sadly, there was a 5th Columnist in the Reagan White House... George H.W. Bush. It was Bush41 who after winning Reagans “third term”, began unraveling the reforms and policies of Renuldus Maximus... for though they worked great for the people, the “elites” did not like all that freedom and prosperity for the common citizen. Bush41 promptly got his “reward” from the “establishment” by being kicked out in his 1992 re-election bid, allowing the awful Slick Willie to gain the Oval Office. In an irony, when Bill Clinton continued to reverse Reagan policies he lost the Congress in 1994. So in a politically shrewd move... he (kinda) adopted some Reagan policies and with a weak RINO opponent (Bob Dole) was re-elected in 1996, only to then disgrace the office... with the full support of the media and Democrats (much of the vulgarity in politics today began with Clinton...IMHO). One must wonder, if Trump can overcome the media and big city fraud to win the POTUS, is establishment Mike Pence his “George Bush II”? God bless America!

I wonder if we can snag that annoying ‘HOPE’ picture of Zero from 2008 and make some liberal heads pop by turning it into one of The Donald.
