Children of serving RAF personnel went to the Russian embassy in London yesterday to protest against Vladimir Putin’s bombing of Aleppo.

Seventeen youngsters, some as young as nine, are begging Moscow to stop killing civilians in the Syrian city – described as a ‘slaughterhouse’ - where tens of thousands of children are trapped.

Their protest comes after Boris Johnson urged anti-war campaigners to stage protests outside the embassy – but Stop the War refused to do so, saying it would contribute to ‘hysteria’.

Now the children have said they will be the ones to protest against war crimes being committed after the foreign secretary’s comments ‘fell on deaf ears’.

Grace Millband, who went to the embassy to protest on Saturday, said: ‘I think the people who are bombing need to stop what they are doing and think about the poor children that have not done anything wrong.’

The nine-year-old, whose father is in the RAF, said: ‘It makes me sad that children like me can’t go to school or play and have a normal life.’

She was joined by Grace Matthews, 10, also the daughter of a serving RAF officer, Phoebe Hawkins, 11, and Felicity Eustace on Saturday.

Felicity, 10, said: ‘It is so sad to see what is happening in Syria. I wish the people can do something, can hurry up and sort out their differences before anymore get hurt.

‘We should all be friends, stay happy and have respect for everyone not hurt each other.’

An estimated 270,000 people, including 100,000 children, are trapped in Aleppo’s eastern districts as bombs continue to rain down on the city in what has been described as a humanitarian catastrophe

Phoebe Hawkins added: ‘I wonder why today’s world leaders don’t seem to learn from the mistakes of the past?’

An estimated 270,000 people, including 100,000 children, are trapped in Aleppo’s eastern districts as bombs continue to rain down on the city in what has been described as a humanitarian catastrophe.

Jim Dooley, a campaigner for veterans, said: ‘Evil happens when good men do nothing. An appeal from our foreign secretary for protest to stop the indiscriminate bombing of Aleppo has fallen on deaf ears. It seems it is down to 9 and 11-year-olds to answer the call.’

The children – who are part of a group called YoungstArs – went to the Russian embassy to deliver a CD of their charity record, ‘The Tears of the World’.

They also went to the Syrian embassy in anger at President Assad’s indiscriminate bombing of children.

The song is designed to persuade leaders of the countries involved to stop bombing children and innocent people.

The protest comes after Boris Johnson urged anti-war campaigners to stage protests outside the embassy – but Stop the War refused to do so, saying it would contribute to ‘hysteria’

All proceeds from the song will go to Lincoln’s Bomber Command centre, dedicated to those who lost their lives during the Second World War. It will be released on November 11th to coincide with Remembrance Day.

Mr Johnson sparked a diplomatic row with the Kremlin last week as he called for demonstrations to be held outside the Russian embassy in London.

Former head of MI6, Sir John Sawers, warned the comments risked retaliation from Moscow and urged politicians to be ‘careful and mindful’ of the security of British embassy staff.

In response, Stop the War Coalition said protesting outside the Russian embassy over Syria would increase the ‘hysteria and jingoism’ that was being ‘whipped up’ against the country.

Mr Johnson then hit back, saying: ‘ To the point about demonstrations outside the Russian embassy, I merely draw attention to the paradox and peculiarity that the Stop the War Coalition has never seen fit to demonstrate against the barbarity, the barbarism, taking place in Aleppo.’
