After a reported health scare which had ordinary Zimbabweans tentatively contemplating what life would be like without him, President Robert Mugabe has returned to his country and made a series of comments to suggest he is as authoritative as ever.

Addressing a meeting of his ruling party’s Zanu PF Youth League upon his return to Harare, Mugabe hit out angrily at judges for permitting a string of protests which turned violent in late August. High Court judges were “negligent” and paid “reckless disregard for the peace of this country” when they allowed members of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) to stage protests in Harare on 26 August, he said, when demonstrations in the week beforehand had already turned violent.

And in an implicit criticism of the social media protest movement #ThisFlag, started by the pastor Evan Mawarire in April, Mugabe said it was the responsibility of all Zimbabweans “to promote brand Zimbabwe, the image of Zimbabwe, a Zimbabwe that is democratic, hardworking and peaceful”.

At the end of last week, the government imposed a two-week ban on all demonstrations in the capital following an assessment by the Harare police commander. That order was made in Mugabe’s absence. On Tuesday, he was reported to have fallen ill and taken an emergency flight for treatment in Singapore. Flight trackers then observed his jet took a sharp turn towards Dubai, halfway to South-east Asia.

But on Saturday he re-emerged, joking to reporters at Harare airport that he had been “resurrected”, and justifying the trip as a visit to his son, Robert Jr, who is at university in the United Arab Emirates.

Referring to the clashes in Harare last month, Mugabe said “so-called protesters” were responsible for “burning property, and looting, and engaging in acts of violence”.

“We can’t allow that to continue, to have these violent demonstrations unimpeded,” he said. “Enough is enough.

“It is not just we the ordinary people who should have the understanding of the need for peace. Our courts, our justice system, our judges should be the ones who understand even better than the ordinary citizens.

“To give permission again when with the full knowledge that it is going to be violent or there is a probability that there is going to be violence is to pay reckless disregard to the peace of this country. I hope they have learnt their lesson.”

Zimbabwe is considering new laws that will outlaw “abuse” on social media. The law is expected to involve measures whereby citizens deemed to have posted negative comments online risk having their phones and computers impounded.

What would entail “abuse” is less clear. But Mr Mugabe said he believed Zimbabwe could “learn from China, Cuba and Russia that economic success stories have resulted from proper and constructive use of IT”.

“Social media should never be used negatively,” he added. “You have quarrelled with someone and you want to take it up on the internet? Get out of it… we should remain clean.”
