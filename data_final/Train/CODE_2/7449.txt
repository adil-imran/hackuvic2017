President Muhammadu Buhari says his administration is bent on diversifying the Nigerian economy to move it from import dependence to self-sufficiency in local production and to become an export-led country in goods and services.

He stated this in Abuja yesterday while declaring open the 22nd Nigerian Economic Summit with the theme “Made in Nigeria”.

The president said the summit would strengthen the relationship between the Federal Government and private sector as its theme lies at the heart of ongoing efforts by the government towards leading the nation through the current “trouble times” and laying a firm foundation for the future.He said the diversification was necessary “so that we can produce the food we eat, make our own textiles, produce most of the things we use and create the right environment for our youths to be able to benefit and create jobs through technology.”According to him, “There is clearly no better way to achieve this without building an economic foundation of made-in-Nigeria goods and services. Fortunately, we have champions of made-in-Nigeria that have defied the odds over the years to produce locally and contribute to our economy. I understand some of them will be discussing at this event to share their experiences.”The president encouraged more local production in order to improve ease of doing business environment, transfer technology and innovation capabilities, improve quality and standards, promote export as well as change our old attitudes and behaviours towards made-in-Nigeria products and services.Earlier, the Minister of Budget and National Planning, Senator Udoma Udo Udoma, said the present administration regarded the private sector as the engine of development which should be held in high esteem.He said the government was already implementing policies aimed at getting the economy out of recession.“These include, amongst other things, taking action to reduce the disruptions in the Niger Delta; fast-tracking measures to raise funding from foreign loans and other sources, to fund the 2016 Capital Budget; targeting capital releases to projects with impact on employment; speeding up the implementation of the social investment programmes etc. Already our focus on agriculture is beginning to yield fruit as indications are that the agriculture sector will show quite strong growth in the third quarter,” the minister said.The chairman of the Nigerian Economic Summit Group, Mr Kyari Bukar, said the government and private sector must jointly promote production and consumption of Made-in-Nigeria goods and services while also maintaining a trade balance between imports and exports and recognising the realities of globalization.“This will reinvigorate moribund industries and services that have shown potentials in the past and curtail the growing demand for foreign exchange for consumption rather than capital products and equipment,” Mr Bukar said.
