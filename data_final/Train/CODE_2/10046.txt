The Howth woman (31) is said to be one of the favourites for the presenting gig on Ireland's upcoming version of Strictly Come Dancing, which is scheduled to air in January.

Former Big Brother winner Brian Dowling recently revealed he screen-tested for the series alongside Vogue at the Radisson Blu Hotel in Stillorgan. "I am keeping my mouth well shut," Williams said when asked about the secret audition.

"I think everybody in Ireland would like to host Dancing With The Stars. There is still competition but I think everyone would like to host a show like that. "I think it's going to be a massive show.

"Regardless of whether I am involved or not, I will definitely be watching it." Dowling revealed he was a bag of nerves ahead of audition for the coveted gig but it was Williams who put him at ease. He described the former Fade Street star as "so easy to get along with".

Other stars rumoured to be in the running include Nicky Byrne, Angela Scanlon, Grainne Seoige and Amanda Byram. Williams, who lives in London, has been enjoying spending time at home in Dublin for the last few weeks.

While she loves working in the UK, the TV star admitted she's unsure if she will ever try to crack America. "I always say I like to go where the work is and I do that but I love my little home in London and I love being able to come back home," she told the Herald.

"I've fallen in love with Dublin all over again since being home for the last month and I would miss that in LA. Then again, if you got a big job in LA you're not going to turn it down." The former reality star is hoping her upcoming series of documentaries for RTE2 will also be picked up in Britain.

"I have loads of show ideas and hopefully my series will sell to the UK. I've seen it and it would work well in the UK," she said.
