CAUVERY BASIN (KARNATAKA): Karnataka opened up its Cauvery basin reservoirs to media scrutiny on Sunday and Monday, ahead of the next Supreme Court hearing on Tamil Nadu's demand for 17 TMCFT (thousand million cubic feet) of water more from the river for their samba (paddy) crop.The Karnataka legislature had a special session on September 23 and passed a unanimous resolution to not release any more water as the state now has just enough to meet the drinking water needs. To further clarify this point, the media, including some representatives from Tamil newspapers, were taken by the state government to the reservoirs and the areas irrigated by them.The storage in all four reservoirs put together is about 27 TMCFT against a drinking water requirement of 25 TMCFT for Bengaluru , Mysuru, Mandya, 48 other towns and 630 villages in the basin.Engineers at the reservoirs gave the storage figures of the last 20 years which indicate that this year's is the lowest ever that the basin has seen, due to the failure of the south-west monsoon in the Cauvery's catchment areas.The figures at Hassan district's Hemavathy reservoir in Gorur town speak volumes, as this this reservoir is set in the middle of greenery, just above the foothills of the Western Ghats."One month of good rain and this reservoir will be full," executive engineer P Subramanya said, wistfully. The reservoir, with a total capacity of 37 TMCFT to irrigate about 7 lakh acres in four districts, is almost bare, with hardly 3.303 TMCFT live storage on Monday, just enough to meet the drinking water needs of Hassan city and Arkalgud town till next May."We live on the bank of Hemavathy. We don't even get drinking water from this river," said farmer Mallesh Hulikal at Bettadahalli village, at the start point of the Hemavathy canal.Farmers all along this canal planted their paddy crop in July, in the hope of getting sufficient water this year, after their crop dried up due to drought last year. Now, there are part of the 63,699 acres of standing crop in Karnataka's Cauvery basin which are drying up due to lack of water."We only have sufficient water for drinking. We have not released any water for irrigation this time," assistant executive engineer P Rangaswamy said at the small Yagachi reservoir up stream from Hemavathy, which just has 1.75 TMCFT live storage.
