Hillary Did Have a Body Double / Vanity

Posted on by chopperman

The reference video talks about her using a green screen but if you go to 4:57 in the video it shows a revealing closeup of the open hands.



TOPICS:

Conspiracy

KEYWORDS:

bodydouble

hillary

You will see that the finger lengths are different as are the palm lines.

I wondered about a different person at the debate last night. Much younger looking. It’s getting ridiculous. Trump should spend some money getting evidence of this woman, whoever she is.

Look for the SS. If you see SS, then it is the real HRC. No SS, then it isn't Her Thighness. "Ceterum censeo Hillary esse delendam." Garde la Foi, mes amis! Nous nous sommes les sauveurs de la République! Maintenant et Toujours!

The hands have it....



To: chopperman

I was going to ask about the teeth. Sometimes they look perfect and sometimes not. I actually wondered if she was wearing what they call a flipper.



To: justlittleoleme

Who in the world believes that you can look totally different in 90 minutes after fainting during a siege of pneumonia? That is impossible. Someone should put a stop to this scam.

Bizarre!

Except for a small clip, how could they get away with it and the woman they showed as her double doesn’t really look identical and I don’t see the difference in the hand.



To: chopperman

Maybe she is a Russian robot.

Voices would not be the same.

This has been documented more than once and the strangest thing is that there is never footage from individuals as we see at every other live event... Hillary is Max Headroom...

Instead of the pictures above, look at 4:57 in the video. Its of her other hand. Either the video was photoshopped somehow or the finger lengths and palm lines are not the same.



To: tiki

Look at the left hand at 4:58; particularly the area by the thumb, one photo shows the lines going vertical and the other not so much vertical but more horizontal.

The US Secret Service would never have let HRC roam around NYC streets that afternoon the way the body double did.

The one on the left does not look like the one on the right. The hands, the nose, the teeth. Paging Sherlock Holmes, please pick up the white courtesy phone...

Her face looks like she gets Reaction Skin Tightening done. I guess it can give some remarkable non surgical results. There are also a couple of non evasive treatments that have the Cinderella effect; temporary.



To: chopperman

The idea of a "body double" doesn't make any sense to me, but I have no problem believing that many of these appearances and rallies are staged by the campaign and have no media coverage other than a video that gets released to the public and may be doctored extensively. For example ... When I first saw the video clip of Hillary Clinton exiting Chelsea's building on the afternoon of 9/11 looking perfectly healthy and waving to reporters, I noticed immediately that she looked different. But I didn't assume that it was a "body double" she was using. I assumed the video outside the building was made at a different time and/or was heavily doctored. The fact that we don't see random spectators using cell phones to take photos or record videos at these events and then posting them online is very telling.

To: HokieMom

Sure they would. But they wouldn't let her do it with random strangers in the background. I would assume every person in that video clip was a member of the campaign staff or a paid operative who has already been vetted by the Secret Service. Has anyone identified the little girl who was exposed to Hillary Clinton's infectious pneumonia?

FWIW, the real Hillary has a simian crease. Check the palms of her hands.



To: tiki

The difference in the hands is one has a shorter index finger but a longer fourth finger. The other is the opposite with a longer index but a shorter fourth. The was noticed by FR on the day she came out of Chelsea’s apartment looking so young and spry. This past week, she was practically skipping up the plane steps when it wasn’t long ago she could barely walk without aid. A few weeks go, she ordered the msm away before she boarded her plane. Sometimes she has facial wrinkles and other days she looks twenty years younger. The wobbly one wear flat shoes. The spry one wears heals. Back when she was First Lady, she was 5’4”. Instead of getting shorter with age, she grew to 5’7” at the beginning of the campaign but around the time of her collapse at the 9/11 Memorial, she was back to 5’4”. She can vary a good 20 lbs. from one appearance to another. The thinner person is the healthier, spryer and younger version and has thinner legs than Cankles. However, the thinner one seems to have some extra padding around the waist in recent days. I posted she was fatter around the middle last night and that her hair was styled to cover her ears and was wearing her larger earrings. A few times during the debate, she would look down and close her eyes and nod as if listening to the voices in her head. She also looked like she was going to cry last night which I’ve never seen Hellary do. Black Bart, her doctor, hasn’t been with her recently but has been shadowing BJ. Huma has been AWOL, too. It’s rumored she’s going to have a couple more rallies but then will take the remaining days before the election off. Hellary wants this too much to not go for each and every vote. Body double or not, there’s lots of weird stuff going.

To: chopperman

She does not have a body double. There’s plenty to look at in the wiki docs without getting sidetracked with this diversion tactic.



To: justlittleoleme

Nose and ears, especially ears, are usually the dead giveaways.



To: chopperman

Maybe she cloned herself.

I heard clones can be more prone to health problems.

Which one is the clone?

Hillary has people out there making up stuff just to “squirrel!” everyone.

I’m Series.

To: right way right

It’s a diversion from the wikileaks docs. There’s stuff in those speeches that have more proof of what a disgusting money-grubbing traitor she is, and here we’re wasting time talking about her body double.



To: Heart of Georgia

Like I said, Hillary's campaign feeding us this stuff.Yes, you are right.

Who cares if there is a body double.

It would not really matter with Hillary.
