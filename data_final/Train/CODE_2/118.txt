DENVER (CBS4) – Every day, dozens of people are moving to Colorado. Come the year 2035, its estimated 100,000 more people will call Denver their home, according to officials with the City of Denver’s Planning & Development.

“Denver is one of the most rapidly changing and vibrant cities in the country and now is the time to come together and decide what we want to be in the next 20 years,” Andrea Burns, Communications Director for the Community Planning & Development with the City of Denver, told CBS4.

As city officials prepare plans for Denver’s future, they want the community’s input on what the Mile High City should look like.

“Do you care about parks? Do you care about open space? Do you care about transit and good mobility opportunities? These are all things we want to capture,” Burns said.

On Oct. 4 and 5, the City and County of Denver is hosting five workshops where the public can share their ideas. Whether they be about population growth, traffic concerns or public transit, planners want to hear from everyone.

“So some of the things that we’re hearing from people is, ‘I want more transit options,’ ‘I want more light rail, more rapid bus transit..’ And they also want better sidewalks, better connectivity and better trails,” Burns said. “This is how planning works today and we want to hear from all of you.”

October 4:

• 7:30a-9:30a, Downtown Denver; McNichols Building, 144 W. Colfax Ave.
