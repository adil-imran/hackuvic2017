Giuliani shut down Mexican president during Trump meeting

NY POST ^ | September 5,2016 | Marisa Schultz

Posted on by COUNTrecount

WASHINGTON  Rudy Giuliani shut down discussion about payment for the border wall during Donald Trumps meeting last week with the Mexican president because it wasnt part of the ground rules for the Mexico City visit, the former New York mayor said Sunday.

Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto indeed brought up who would pay for a border wall  despite Trumps initial claim it wasnt discussed  but Giuliani told CNNs State of the Union he snuffed out the subject quickly in favor of common ground.

I said that it was off the table, Giuliani said. We had ground rules for this meeting and one of the ground rules was we are not going to discuss paying for the wall because thats not something we are going to agree about. What we wanted to do is find areas of common agreement. And maybe the presidents staff didnt brief him about it, maybe the president forgot it, but he brought it up. It wasnt at the very beginning, it was sort of in the middle of a sentence and I just briefly said: Thats not on the table. The reality is they have a disagreement over that.

They will certainly pay. We have the cards and will take it out in trade.

Tax wire transfers from the US to Mexico until we’ve collected payment for the wall. They’d cry “Uncle!” soon enough.



To: COUNTrecount

If true, that is interesting, because it shows how quickly Trump and his associates can act and acted. They received the invitation and very soon they not only accepted it, organized the logistics, and most importantly laid down ground rules for the actual meeting, ie managed some early negotiations. Now that is what you expect from an executive and his team!

Sí, se puede. Mexico will pay.

Trump's website has a section that makes a very good case for how Mexico will be made to pay for the wall. DonaldJTrump.com: Compelling Mexico to Pay for the Wall

I know we don’t like to consider ourselves hyphenated Americans on this board. And I don’t either. But as a descendant second generation of Italians I am so proud of Rudy Giuliani. He is my hero and even though he doesn’t have conservative credentials enough to be president, he is a great man and a true patriot. I love Trump too and Trump picked Rudy for a reason.

my nephews and niece’s don’t care either way lol. They are 3rd generation and it starts to fade. It is what it is. No biggie. But he holds a special place in my heart as does Trump

I have much admiration for RG, and certainly would have preferred him as the candidate over McCain, and there’s no question between him and Obama. I would have felt secure with RG...you’d know with him he would put America first.



To: miss marmelstein; dp0622

But don’t you remember how all the nay-sayers were so worried when Trump took off for Mexico. He was going there on song and a prayer they said, and everything could go so wrong. Well, turns out that the Trump team had it all in hand. I am very glad that Giuliani is in Trump’s inner circle. I thought he was going to be a much better candidate than he was in 2008, but on Trump’s team he seems like a fish in water.

Why not simply confiscate the property of the drug cartels?

I’m wrong on a lot of things but on this one I said from day one it was a great idea and there was no chance of him being assassinated. That’s the last thing drug cartels would want. illegal organizations tend not to want to attract that much attention. And it was a win-win situation going down there even though the media try to warp it. Rudy truly is a fish in water with Trump. Two great men of our time.

by the way the media made a big stink because the Mexican president said Trump would be bad for Mexico. Who gives a damn? This is America.

Let’s focus on priorities. Number 1 is: Build Wall. We can worry about who pays for the wall later. In fact, it’s really not important compared to securing the border. And if Donald Trump can get taxes reformed and get the economy moving again, the cost of the wall is meaningless.



To: COUNTrecount

Just because the other guy says something doesn’t mean there was a discussion. Geezers man

Go Rudy Rudy has his flaws. But on 9/11 he showed courage when courage mattered. He is a truly a mensch, a person of integrity and honor. Yes indeed, go Rudy!

I’m tellin’ ya, the way you get Mexico to pay for the wall is you put convenience stores up all along the length of it and sell, beer, lottery tickets and money orders. The front doors face Mexico.

We have ALL the cards, three are 3 ways they WILL pay for the damned wall (1) fees attached to monies sent home (2) Trade fees (3) most of all US aid given to Mexico, MEXICO WILL PAY!!! I for one don’t frankly give a damn if WE pay, it WILL BE tax dollars WELL SPENT for a change!!!

We have a dozen ways to make them pay.

“Discussed” involves a two-way exchange. It wasn’t “discussed.”

No it was not discussed. Mexico brought it up and we refused to discuss it because for us it is a done deal. Mexico will fund it it because it is OUR money Mexicans are taking out of OUR country. We are going to stop that. You see, we simply care more about our own intersts than we do about yours.

Exactly, where was Rudy, or any other Trump spokesperson to defend Trump when the media was calling him a liar for saying that payment for the wall was never discussed. Words have meanings and his was exactly true, and so was the Mexican Pres.

One of the agreements for the meeting was ‘that’ was off the table for the first meeting. Giuliani just reminded everyone... Giuliani’s a good man.

Rudy’s handling of New York during 9/11 was incredible. Have you read his book, “Leadership”? It is fantastic.



To: COUNTrecount

Hmmm. I wonder if Rudy is getting tuned up to be Secretary of State?

In my last search through the internet, I concluded that remittances were 1/4 th of their 1.13 Trillion dollar GDP That would be about $280B but in fact is is about $24B. That is what the Trump website says in its "Day 2" narrative on how Mexico will pay for the wall (link at post 6 above). $24B is about 1/50th of their $1.29T (2015) GDP.
