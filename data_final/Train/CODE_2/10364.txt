The Nigerian Senate has began consideration of nominees forÂ Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) board with Senate president Bukola Saraki presiding over the plenary.

Nigerian Senate session

The Senate reverted to committee of the whole to deliberate on their confirmation.

However, three out of the 19 were not confirmed. They includeÂ Hon.Donatus Enyinnaya of Abia state, Sen. OSita Bonaventure Izunaso, Imo state and Olatokunbo Ayotunde Ajasin of Ondo state.

Saraki thanked the committee for their efforts and congratulated the chairman and the new members ofÂ the board.

Two months ago, the Senate officially received a letter from President Muhammadu Buhari requesting the confirmation of Victor Ndoma Egba as chairman and Isima Ekere as managing director of the NDDC.

The Nigerian Senate had on Tuesday, October 4, screenedÂ Senator Victor Ndoma-Egba, the former Senate leader, as chairman of NDDC board and other members.

However, the formerÂ Senate leader wasÂ not screened, but spoke briefly to his colleagues, even as he was later asked to take a bow.
