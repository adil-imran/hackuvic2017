The couple will first tie the knot in her dad's native Doolin. In the run-up to the big day, Aoibhin (29) decided to jet off to the sunshine and enjoy a few days in the upmarket Puerto Banus.

The actress, who is best known for her turn as Neasa Dillon on the soap, has been working hard to look her best by lifting weights and running ahead of her wedding.

Among those expected at her big day is her close pal and former co-star on Fair City Aoibheann McCaul. Just last month, Aoibhin had her hen party at the exclusive Mount Juliet Estate in Co Kilkenny.

Aoibhin and her gal pals indulged in some spa treatments before taking part in the old-fashioned country pursuit of falconry. They then headed into Kilkenny city to enjoy some cocktails before hitting the tiles.

glitz Aoibhin and John got engaged in June 2015 while enjoying a walk on the Cliffs of Moher.

The actress, who also appeared in the Fall alongside Jamie Dornan, has said that she is looking forward to a low-key affair with her nearest and dearest. "It's more about the people and the place and the day itself than the glitz and the glam. I hope it'll be a sentimental day," she said.
