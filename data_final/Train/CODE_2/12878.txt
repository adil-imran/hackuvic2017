The shackles are off! Donald Trump issues declaration of war on the GOP

Twitchy ^ | October 11, 2016 | Greg P.

Posted on by justlittleoleme

Well, the next 28 days will be interesting, to say the least. Donald Trump started this morning with an attack on Paul Ryan:

Despite winning the second debate in a landslide (every poll), it is hard to do well when Paul Ryan and others give zero support!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 11, 2016

Our very weak and ineffective leader, Paul Ryan, had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 11, 2016

And then he just basically declared war on the rest of the GOP:

It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 11, 2016

With the exception of cheating Bernie out of the nom the Dems have always proven to be far more loyal to each other than the Republicans!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 11, 2016

Update. He added this tweet after we published the original post:

Disloyal R's are far more difficult than Crooked Hillary. They come at you from all sides. They dont know how to win - I will teach them!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 11, 2016

Wait, he hasnt been himself up until now?

Go Donald! He is the only Republican with a balls to stand up to this corruption on all sides, while the leaders of the GOP stand by and help the demoncrats try to win this.

Anybody read a lie there? I didn’t. I didn’t even see something CLOSE to an untruth in all those tweets.

He signed the pledge

He played by their rules

He jumped thru their hoops

and they screwed him

Now he is on his own to fight the good fight

Please vote and if elected like an antibody he will fight the cancer that is the modern Republican and Democratic parties that are killing the America we used to have.

God Bless you Donald J Trump!

Dump Ryan. This insane little piece of crap is not worthy holding office. He is for Hillary. Trump for President.

How should President Trump deal with the turncoat RINOs once he takes office? This includes ones who (conveniently and) publicly apologize after Trump wins the election, and those who dont. Should there be some sort of penance? Should the state GOP parties start looking for replacements in the future primary elections involving turncoat RINOs? In Nebraska, turncoat Senator Ben Sasse was an up-and-coming politician, considered by some on a fasttrack for a presidential bid in next decade, at least until he was rebuked by the Nebraska GOP convention, 400-8. Should he be told that a presidential bid will no longer be an option in the GOP? What penalty could the Republican party impose? Should Reince Priebus remain as RNC Chairman? Should he be replaced or at least be required to change his name?

Now, if would get the opposition to talk about the issues that voters care about and stop all the distractions. The ‘rats are afraid to talk about the ISSUES. Get in a GROOVE Mr. Trump and grind it down!

To: bray

Everything happening right now points to one thing: “the RINOs are more afraid of Trump winning then losing”. It is so obvious. There must be a tremendous amount of corruption going on with the Republicans in Congress. That would explain why all the TEA party members suddenly became RINOs. Please note that Ryan became unhinged “after” Trump threatened Hillary with jail. I firmly beleive that that is the basis for the nevertrump movement. Trump is planning on draining the swamp and just as many RINOs as Rats will go to jail.

You know I truly believe they (obama, hillary, ryan, mccain, lynch, jarrett, comey, msm) would turn the military loose if Trump won. I would hope the Generals tell their men to stand down. I have NO DOUBT that any of them would have a problem mowing us down. Maybe not McCain. He’s not evil, just stupid and too worried about being liked.

It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to. Donald J. Trump I am ready to abandon the GOPe totally after this childish and counter-productive announcement by Ryan. I live and vote in Virginia's 10th District. If Barbara Comstock cannot bring herself to support Trump in Virginia, I will not vote for Comstock. I will leave that box blank because I believe that her opponent is an agent of Satan. Without unity there is no Republican party. Comstock, Ryan, and other weak-kneed GOPe are putting themselves above the needs of our country. They do not believe that a house divided will not stand. They also lack something to not realize the grave importance of this election. Trump will rebuild the Republican Party while he is POTUS.



To: justlittleoleme

The quotes show he is upset with Paul Ryan. There is no quote showing he is going to war with the Republican party. He should go to war with the Democratic party, not the Republican party.

All of the Cheap Labor Express Republicans need to be removed from office. Make no mistake, it is not about what Trump said 11 years ago, it is about maintaining their 30 year bipartisan policy of non-enforcement of immigration laws and borders.

I’m not a big trump guy but can you imagine Harry Reid or Pelosi doing what Ryan and McConnel have done? The rise of Trump can be traced to the ineptitude of the republican leadership. We are looking for anyone that will fight the left...Trump fills the void.

Donald Trump may have an (R) next to his name on the ballot but his candidacy transcends party affiliation. This is truly a battle against the entrenched politicians of both parties as well as a media that is 100% in league with them. I can count the number of big media Trump supporters on one hand (i.e. Hannity) and they are likely to be out of work really soon. I always knew the media was biased but I never realized that the bias was so deep. I also never realized just how deep the betrayal has been with many establishment Republicans and how those establishment Republicans work with the Democrats to ensure "uni-party" rule. Donald Trump poses a serious danger to the establishment and they have pulled out all stops to ensure he does not get elected. Up until a few weeks ago, they privately thought that Trump had no chance but now they are running scared because Trump may now actually have the support to win this thing and win it overwhelmingly. Look for many rank-and-file Democrats to (at least secretly) vote for Trump. They won't feel like they are betraying their party by voting for a Republican because the Republicans hate him too. Trump is now much more of an anti-establishment vote than a partisan Republican vote. If Donald Trump happened to be running as a Democrat and beat out the establishment candidates for the Democrat nomination, I would have zero problem voting for Trump in November. Especially if the GOP nominated somebody like Jeb Bush or John Kasich.

“There must be a tremendous amount of corruption going on with the Republicans in Congress.” The Republican Party is every bit as corrupt as the Democrat...they are just less effective because they don’t pursue any agenda, they just enrich themselves and call it good. Because they have a policy agenda to go along with payoffs, the Democrats get loyalty from their rank-and-file and they always stick together. The Republicans? Well, pretty much EVERYONE hates them, rightfully so. Trump might do better as an Independent anyway. This is the last chance by ballot. After this, Washington D.C. in whole needs to be taken out by whatever means necessary.

Ask Carol McCain how “nice” he is.



To: justlittleoleme

Trump ran against the GOPe AND the Dems and did well.

Then he ‘made peace’ with the GOPe and has not done as well. The ‘moderate’ Republican voters will have, like us conservatives always had, a choice between Trump and Clinton.

And anti-establishment Dems will have a choice. Both groups can either vote for Pelosi, Reid/Schumer, McConnell and Ryan- or for Trump. I just hope it’s not too late.
