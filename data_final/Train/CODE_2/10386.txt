BREAKING: We Just Discovered REAL Reason Why Comey Didnt Charge Hillary This WILL Cost Him His JOB

AMERICAS FREEDOM FIGHTERS ^ | 9/10/2016 | Alicia Powe

Posted on by b4its2late

From Hillary Clintons aides, to her technicians, and all the way up to her lawyers who supervised the destruction of government records and classified material that they were not even cleared to touch, there are many, many people who deserve a fate far worse than that which Martha Stewart was subjected to.

When FBI Director James Comey did not recommend charges for Hillary Clintons mishandling of classified material by sending, receiving, and storing it on an unauthorized personal email server Americans were shocked.

Comey claimed that Clinton did not intend to break the law when she sent and received classified emails over her home-brew server. If you had a hunch that he was paid off, that would be an understatement.

A review of FBI Director James Comeys professional history and relationships shows that he and his brother have been in bed with the Clintons all along.

More from Breitbart:

His personal and professional relationships  all undisclosed as he announced the Bureau would not prosecute Clinton  reinforce bipartisan concerns that he may have politicized the criminal probe.

These concerns focus on millions of dollars that Comey accepted from a Clinton Foundation defense contractor, Comeys former membership on a Clinton Foundation corporate partners board, and his surprising financial relationship with his brother Peter Comey, who works at the law firm that does the Clinton Foundations taxes.

Comey earned $6 million in one year alone from Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin became a Clinton Foundation donor that very year.

According to records, Lockheed Martin is also a member of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt, which paid Bill Clinton $250,000 to deliver a speech in 2010.

In 2010, Lockheed Martin won 17 approvals for private contracts from the Hillary Clinton State Department.

In 2013, Comey became a board member, a director, and a Financial System Vulnerabilities Committee member of the London bank HSBC Holdings.

HSBC Holdings and its various philanthropic branches routinely partner with the Clinton Foundation. For instance, HSBC Holdings has partnered with Deutsche Bank through the Clinton Foundation to retrofit 1,500 to 2,500 housing units, primarily in the low- to moderate-income sector in New York City.

When our source called the Chinatown offices of D.C. law firm DLA Piper and asked for Peter Comey, a receptionist immediately put him through to Comeys direct line. But Peter Comey is not featured on the DLA Piper website.

Peter Comey serves as Senior Director of Real Estate Operations for the Americas for DLA Piper. James Comey was not questioned about his relationship with Peter Comey in his confirmation hearing.

DLA Piper is the firm that performed the independent audit of the Clinton Foundation in November during Clinton-Worlds first big push to put the email scandal behind them. DLA Pipers employees taken as a whole represent a major Hillary Clinton 2016 campaign donation bloc and Clinton Foundation donation base.

DLA Piper ranks #5 on Hillary Clintons all-time career Top Contributors list, just ahead of Goldman Sachs.

And here is another thing: Peter Comey has a mortgage on his house that is owned by his brother James Comey, the FBI director.

Trickle-down corruption.

When President Obama nominated Comey to become FBI director in 2013, Comey promised the United States Senate that he would recuse himself on all cases involving former employers.

He lied. He has in fact politicized the FBI  that is supposed to support the Rule of Law.

The FBIs investigation of Hillary Clinton needs to be re-opened, Comey and Attorney General Loretta Lynch should recuse themselves and Congress should demand the appointment of a Special Prosecutor.

We are in a crisis of corruption that is permeating all corners of our government, even now reaching to into the FBI.

Just imagine how bad the corruption will become if she is president.

I know it's about a month old, dated 9/10/2016, but I had it emailed to me and thought it interesting. Nothing of course will come of it though.

I posted this when it came out at Breitbart and Mr. Comey still sits comfortably in his FBI office.

Judge Napolitano on Fox News this morning suggested that President Trump could have a special prosecutor investigate Comey’s corrupt investigation of Mrs. Clinton.

Nothing will cost him his job unless Trump is elected.

He was placed where he is to protect the corruption of the Kenyanesian Usurpation.

The Clintons have corrupted every institution. Everything that demonic couple touch turns to toxic waste. Clinton Pardons were a horrible mess and Comey blessed them. See Marc Rich New Square FALN

Sure. Once the media run with the story, and blast it 24/7, on all talk shows, all pundits, and on headlines for 3 weeks. Obviously comey was told by he bammy administration to obey, or face the consequences. Just like Roberts, the Supreme Court justice.

Well if it’s a month old it obviously didn’t cost him his job.

Why will nothing happen ? Because there is most likely a long line on both sides of the aisle who would also have to go down. The only people not at the insiders feeding trough is the common American tax payer. Guess we should get over it.



To: b4its2late

I was listening to NPR interview an ex federal AG about the case and the comment was made by the interviewer, “...that’s why Comey chose not to prosecute...” and the ex-AG said he agreed. At which point I knew it was all BS because I’m not even an AG and the first thing I thought, when the interviewer said it was, “the FBI is not who makes that decision.”. And yet the ex-AG agreed with the interviewer. For me, it proves the whole interview was a show and nothing more.

Glad you posted this. I did not read it when first published. The author does a good job of laying out the facts , one by one, without filler.



To: HypatiaTaught

Can you imagine if our votes truly mattered... About half of the voters in this Nation are in bed with Clinton. That is how our Nation is already dead, and just looking for a ditch in which too die.



To: b4its2late

Maybe you’re right that nothing will come of it, but I posted this info on my FB page a few weeks ago and it’s info that most did not know. Now they’re at least educated about it. Whether it changes their vote, or not, who can say.

How can the O pardon someone if they haven’t been indicted or charged?

If Trump wins, Valerie Jarrett will get writer’s cramp signing Obama’s name to all the hundreds of pardons it’ll take.



To: Jaded

He can’t. But some point to the Ford pardon of Nixon, forgetting that (1) Nixon was a sitting President, and (2) no one challenged Ford based on the legal definition of “pardon.”

To: b4its2late

This is older news, I saw this weeks ago. The main point here is that: “Law and Order in the USA is

a thing of the past. “ The fact that a Supreme Court Justice is suddenly dead, and no autopsy performed and they rushed the body away, and all the Crime the Clintons have gotten away with, and where is the DOJ to be found these days??? No, the people of the USA have been busy with their lives, and thus allowed their Government to be completely taken over. That is the Harsh Truth that all people need to comprehend and understand. Sad I know, but those are the Facts.

incredible and disgusting. We’re Rome in the last days. We have to back Trump no matter what!! Some here think if, God forbid Trump loses, we go “oh well” and go to bed. No ####ing way!! Trump should NEVER concede a banana republic election where the press is bought and paid for by one party on a scale rivaling Pravda and Tass!!! If it leads to civil war, then let it lead there. This bitch isn’t going to be my president EVER.

The FBIs investigation of Hillary Clinton needs to be re-opened, Comey and Attorney General Loretta Lynch should recuse themselves and Congress should demand the appointment of a Special Prosecutor. IMHO, the chances of any of this happening while nobama occupies the White House are considerably less than zero. Especially the Special Prosecutor. The Uniparty has no desire to upset the apple cart.

FBI Director Comey gave aid and comfort to the enemy. The Constitution has a word for that.

Nothing of course will come of it though. Not if we don't try to expose and shame our elected into doing the right thing.....AND Director Comey should step down...it's a fight folks...Clinton's are Arkansas Mafia...everything they have touched loses whatever integrity they ever had...this vicious campaign to out Trump is because "they" can't allow an outsider to destroy their criminal power-house! CLINTON'S BEHIND BARS - SAVE AMERICA! NO TO HILLARY!!!

yep, you’re right. They’ve become complacent. The Constitution and Founders have been made obsolete by the left. The USSC will rule the roost.

About half of the voters in this Nation are in bed with Clinton. You are correct. I have often said that over half of Americans are totally ignorant and so many are on welfare that the scales are tipped. If Trump makes it to be President it will be a one of the wonders of the world. Trump for President.



To: GingisK

About half of the voters in this Nation are in bed with Clinton. ____________________________________ And about “half” of those are not American citizens and/or are dead citizens... And don’t forget the computer hacking of electronic voting “flipping” one’s vote to the desired candidate... But alas as Mark Twain stated: If our votes truly mattered, they would not let us do it.

Ford pardoned Nixon without an indictment or conviction. In the event Trump wins the election, Obie will be signing pardons like a man possessed.

The only one he won’t be able to pardon is himself.

The people always count! IF they will stand and fight, for too long the TV ad—the emotional appeal wins the day. Do you think they would have been less harsh to Cruz? Perry? Rubio? or Carley? NOPE. It was a set up from the start. Hillary will cheat her way into the White House and Bill will get his women. BUT. What will we the People do? We better have a plan! We better be able to strike—form a new Party of the Right—March in the streets and resist. If it means tearing the Nation apart—So Be It! Let the Russians and the Chinese have the planet and see what they do with the world? See if they like being the new policemen of the world.
