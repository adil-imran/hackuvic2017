President Rouhani Voices Concern about Situation of Iranian Asylum-Seekers in Australia

TEHRAN (FNA)- Iranian President Hassan Rouhani expressed concern about the Australian authorities' mistreatment of the Iranian nationals seeking asylum in the country.

"We hope that Australia will treat asylum-seekers in compliance with the international laws and regulations and this issue is important to us considering the humanitarian concerns," President Rouhani said in a meeting with Canberra's new Ambassador to Iran Ian Biggs in Tehran on Sunday.

Elsewhere, he underlined the necessity for both countries to use the opportunities created after the nuclear deal between Tehran and the world powers to further expand their ties and cooperation.

President Rouhani also referred to efforts to fight against terrorism in the region and the world, and said, "Terrorism is a global problem and uprooting the problem depends on collective and international cooperation."

Biggs, for his part, underscored the necessity for the development of relations between Tehran and Canberra in the banking and private sectors, and said, "We are also concerned about the type of treatment with the asylum-seekers and are negotiating and cooperating with the relevant international bodies in this regard."

His remarks came after thousands of protesters across Australia held rallies on Sunday to demand the closure of the country's overseas refugee detention centers.

Demonstrators took to the streets of several Australian cities yesterday, carrying banners with the words "Close the camps, Bring them here" to demand that asylum seekers and refugees from camps on Nauru and Papua New Guinea (PNG) islands be resettled on the mainland.

Under Australian law, anyone intercepted while trying to reach the country by boat is sent for processing to detention centers on Manus Island off PNG or the Pacific island of Nauru.

Some asylum seekers have spent years in the camps, which have been criticized by the United Nations and human rights groups, with numerous reports of abuse and self-harm among detainees, including children.
