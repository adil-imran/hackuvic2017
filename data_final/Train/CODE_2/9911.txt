Russian President Vladimir Putin has canceled a planned visit to France after Paris shortened the program for the trip. The development comes amid increased tensions between Russia and France over Moscow's veto of a French UN Security Council draft resolution on Syria.Putin was expected to arrive in Paris next week, but the visit has now been postponed, the Kremlin confirmed.The Kremlin official would not comment on why France chose to change the program of Putin's visit, saying that "this question should be addressed to the French side."Commenting on the cancellation of the visit, French President Francois Hollande said on Tuesday he was prepared to meet Putin "at any moment" to discuss Syria."I consider it is necessary to have dialogue with Russia, but it must be firm and frank otherwise it has no place and it is a charade. I'm ready to meet President Putin if we can make progress on peace," the French leader said during a session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE).Earlier, French diplomatic sources told Reuters that France wanted to downgrade the planned visit and cancel all events except a working meeting with President Hollande on Syria and that Russia chose to postpone the visit instead.Moscow said that the resolution would protect terrorist group Al-Nusra Front, which controls a greater portion of eastern Aleppo, under a pretext of humanitarian relief. An alternative proposal by Russia, which would seek a deal with the group to grant them safe passage out of the city and spare its civilian population, was rejected by other members of the UNSC.French officials accused Russia and the Assad regime of committing war crimes in Syria and threatened to ask the International Criminal Court to probe the allegations. It was not immediately clear how Paris wanted to deliver on the threat, considering that the ICC has no jurisdiction over Syria.The cancellation of Putin's visit may have been the reason why France rather than another nation submitted the draft resolution, which Russia was expected to veto even before it was discussed at the Security Council, independent journalist Robert Harneis told RT."Why should it be France? It could have been Britain. After all, Britain and France compete with each other to run after the Americans all the time. So one wonders whether it was deliberate to make it impossible for this meeting to take place," he said.He believes that France acted on a cue from Washington in this situation, but Putin's not coming to Paris may actually benefit President Hollande during the upcoming election in France. After all, Putin might have touched upon France's own misdeeds, like the overstepping of a UN mandate to enforce a no-fly zone in Libya, which was used to destroy Muammar Gaddafi's army, which was done by primarily France and Britain, Harneis said.
