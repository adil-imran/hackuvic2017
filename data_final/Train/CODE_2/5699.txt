Bulgaria 'Might Have Colluded with Mossad, Palestinians' in Omar Zayed Death

Novinite.com Tuesday 11th October, 2016

The death of Omar Zayed in the Palestinian Embassy might have been the result of "potential collusion between the Mossad, Bulgarian security services, and Palestinian embassy personnel," watchdog journalism organization MintPress News has said.

Zayed's body was found in front of the Palestinian Embassy building on February 26, after an extradition request had been issued for him by Israeli authorities but the Palestinian man had sought refuge in the embassy.

"If it was, indeed, a murder, as so many allege and as the circumstances surrounding his death suggest, how did the murderers succeed in getting into the embassy' Why was there no security presence'

The article recalls Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov's visit to Israel and later to the Palestinian Authority before Zayed's death and quotes him as telling reporters that he "told both sides that Bulgaria respects the rule of law and will follow the legal procedures in the case."

But the text argues the public statement likely "concealed... a deal between the two parties: Bulgaria would uphold international law publicly, while privately giving a green light to Israel to either kidnap Zayed and return him to Israel or assassinate him."

It cites Bulgaria's positioning as "one of the most corrupt states in Europe" where "virtually anything and anyone there is for sale."

The author, however, admits the offer on behalf of Bulgaria could have been an agreement "only to Zayed's kidnapping and return to israel to face punishment for his earlier crime."

A probe into a suspected murder was launched following news of his death. While MintPress quotes authorities as categorically determining "Zayed died as a result of violence", that was never confirmed officially, with Chief Prosecutor Sotir Tsatsarov even dismissing suggestions.

The case sparked controversy as several factors blocked cooperation between Bulgarian investigators and a Palestinian delegation who had arrived to look into the murder. Bulgarian authorities retorted no joint action was possible as the group included no prosecutors or investigators.

"Bulgarian authorities immediately opened an investigation into the incident. But nothing has come of it to date, and Bulgarian police and other authorities related to the investigation have rarely mentioned the case," the article reads.

It also quotes Israeli state radio's report on the incident, which reads that "a security source told Kol Yisrael it has no interest in targeting an old terrorist especially if it involves a great outlay of resources or endangering [agents]."
