Barbados Tuesday expressed disappointment that a settlement has not yet been reached to allow policyholders to recoup some of their finances following the collapse of the Trinidad-based regional insurance conglomerate, Colonial Life Insurance Company (CLICO).

Finance Minister Chris Sinckler, addressing the Central Bank of Barbados (CBB) sponsored Domestic Financial Institutions Conference, said he has held talks with the team from the government and the judicial manager in a bid to resolve the issue.

He said a statement will be issued soon and the transition completed by year end..

“I can assure you that in a couple weeks time I will be issuing an appropriate on it that hopefully will be done jointly with the judicial managers to indicate the time line for which we have now determined and that transition should be complete and with it of course the resumption of the payment of various awards and premiums …that are due to members of the public,” he said.

The appointment of the judicial manager is part of the initiative by Eastern Caribbean governments, including Barbados, to recover some of the assets of policy holders with the Trinidad-based CLICO, which is part of the financially troubled CL Financial Group.

CLICO and its sister company, the British American Insurance Company (BAICO) collapsed in 2009 and the Trinidad and Tobago government signed a shareholders’ agreement with then CLICO chairman Lawrence Duprey following the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between them on January 30, 2009. The MOU gave the government control of 49 per cent of CLICO’s shares.

The then Patrick Manning government injected seven billion Trinidad and Tobago dollars (One TT dollar =US$0.16 cents) into CLICO in 2009 to keep the collapsed insurance firm running and protect policy holders.

A few months later, through the passage of legislation in the Parliament, the Kamla Persad Bissessar led coalition People’s Partnership Government committed a further TT$13 billion to keep the floundering insurance company afloat..

Meanwhile, Sinckler has again called on taxpayers who owe government millions of dollars to take advantage of the soon to be announced tax amnesty that ends in February next year.

“Our position is that after this amnesty ends in February, there is going to be a very vigorous approach by the Barbados Revenue Authority and the authorities generally to collect all of those taxes that are due to Government,” he said.

During this year’s Financial Statement and Budgetary Proposals, Sinckler announced that government would again offer a tax amnesty from September 15, 2016, through to February 15, 2017, to taxpayers across the tax categories of VAT, income tax and land tax.
