POLICE divers are back scouring the Swan River in Fremantle for more clues into the murder of Mosman Park artist Annabelle Chen.

Ms Chen’s body was found in the Swan River by a fisherman on the morning of the federal election, July 2.

But her identity was not confirmed until September 5 after Ms Chen’s daughter flew in from Melbourne and raised the alarm about her missing mother.

A police spokesman said Water Police divers would conduct further river searches near the Fremantle traffic bridge, near Beach Street, on Wednesday morning as part of the ongoing investigation.

He did not say whether police were looking for anything in particular.

During previous searches of the river, police found more of the distinctive green floral tiles that were placed in the suitcase to weigh it down.

Police also discovered a scooter with a chopping board attached to it in the river, believed to have been used to dump the suitcase in the water.

Last week, Post Newspapers reported that tiles matching those found in the suitcase appeared to match bathroom tiles in a Mosman Park house the 57-year-old victim once owned.

That property was sold by Ms Chen, a reclusive artist with estranged family in Perth, 11 years ago and the home has since had two different owners.

There is no suggestion that any of the owners or residents since 2005 ever met Ms Chen.

Police say the tile link is one of many lines of inquiry in this investigation.

Police have been forensically examining the Meath Mews home where Ms Chen lived until her death.

Seven News reports Ms Chen’s wealth is a motive under investigation.

She had reportedly received more than $10 million in a divorce settlement in the early 1990s.

Last week, police identified 57-year-old Ms Chen as the murder victim and began searching her home on Meath Mews, Mosman Park, for forensic evidence.

Major Crime Detective Senior Sergeant Tom Mills last week said piecing together Ms Chen’s private life was the biggest challenge facing police investigating her death.

He said there was “nothing that indicates anything” at the Meath Mews home to date.

Police have issued a public plea for anyone who had any association with Ms Chen, who practised Buddhism and Catholicism, to come forward.

“We’re trying to work out her lifestyle so we’re looking for people who may have known her in a business sense, or privately, her hairdresser, if she went to a nail salon somewhere, a doctor — whether it’s a natural medicine or a general practitioner — who her dentist was, which chemist did she go to.”
