Buenos dias and Happy Wednesday, Golden State!

Story Continued Below

THE BUZZ: Democrats were still feeling the glow in solidly blue California Tuesday, after what was widely viewed as a strong presidential debate performance by Hillary Clinton in the first toe-to-toe with Donald Trump. Case in point: We met up yesterday for lunch with former SF Mayor Willie Brown, as he prepared to to star at a big Hillary Clinton surrogate fundraiser in the city last night alongside California Democratic Party chair John Burton.

-- BIG DEMAND -- “Sold out,’’ Brown reported. And that’s even though tickets for his fundraiser ranged from $250 to $2,500 -- and Hillary wasn’t going to be anywhere in sight. But relieved Dems were apparently eager to revel in the moment of what was generally perceived as a Trump takedown by their candidate -- and to hear Brown and Burton deliver a full Fight Night recap.

-- Some highlights, as told by Brown at lunch -- over a Joe’s Special -- at John’s Grill Booth 21, alongside press agent guru Lee Houskeeper:

-- “Did you see that suit he was wearing -- how big those lapels were? I can’t understand how a guy with that much money can wear such a cheap suit. And the tie -- the material was so bad, you could have set it on fire.”

-- After all the flack Trump’s given Hillary on her health, “his nose was running. Hillary should have stopped, turned to him, smiled and said, “Donald, are you sure you’re OK? Can I offer you a hanky?”

-- “Lester (Holt) was tougher on Trump than Hillary. But Trump missed some opportunities. He could have said, “Hillary, you came into the White House with a U-Haul, and now you’re worth $100 million. What’d you say in this speech, where you made $600,000? And that one? And that one? You won’t release the transcripts -- and you’re criticizing me for not releasing my taxes?”

-- AN UNTOLD SF TALE, “Rose’s Last Ride”: The final services for powerhouse San Francisco Chinatown community organizer Rose Pak last weekend was the stuff of city legend, with 600 mourners at Old St. Mary’s, and the streets of her beloved neighborhood closed for crowds who showed up to pay respects. The big goodbye to a city icon -- Brown delivered the first of several eulogies -- got plenty of coverage in the local media. None of them, apparently caught the big finish.

Seems the funeral cortege included a hundred of cars and a full police escort of more than 2 dozen cops -- who stopped traffic all along the route to the final burial place, a la POTUS’ motorcade. Little problem, Brown tells us: “They went to the wrong cemetery.”

RACE TO THE WHITE HOUSE, CALIFORNIA EDITION:

-- PRO-TRUMP “TECH BROS” AT WORK? -- Did "shit-posters" from @reddit -- the same group funded by wealthy 24-year-old Oculus founder Palmer Luckey -- game online polls for @realDonaldTrump?, via the Daily Dot: “Donald Trump supporters artificially manipulated the results of online polls to create a false narrative that the Republican nominee won the first presidential debate on Monday night. The efforts originated from users of the pro-Trump Reddit community r/The_Donald and 4chan message boards, which bombarded around 70 polls, including those launched by Time, Fortune, and CNBC.” http://bit.ly/2dBCLvv

-- “Why hasn't Donald Trump deleted his embarrassing old tweets? - LA Times’ Matt Pearce: “Here’s a theory: It’d sure be easier for politicians to get away with flip-flops if there weren’t a bunch of their old tweets lying around like crime-scene DNA.” http://lat.ms/2d8h3OA

-- ON TO THE NEXT ONE -- “Post-debate Wisdom 1.0,” by Sherry Bebitch Jeffe and Doug Jeffe on Fox & Hounds: “Note to Donald: Review Ronald Reagan’s performance in the 1984 first debate (he sleepwalked) and second (Reagan’s terrific comeback, pledging not to make his opponent’s ‘youth and inexperience’ an issue). Reagan and Barack Obama both had poor first debate performances, Obama in 2012 against Mitt Romney. Both improved in subsequent rounds and won their elections going away.” http://bit.ly/2dpOo9u

The same attraction was also closed at Santa Clara’s California’s Great America park, according to an email from Knott’s. http://bit.ly/2dr15kv

CALIFORNIA MIXTAPE:

-- NEW FIELD POLL -- Strong Support for Prop. 58, Bilingual Education Measure, by Jack Citrin, Director, IGS, and Mark DiCamillo, Director, The Field Poll: “California voters strongly support Proposition 58, a measure that would allow school districts to broaden the use of bilingual education programs, although that backing turns to opposition when voters are told the measure repeals a key provision of Proposition 227. Proposition 58, which was placed on the ballot by the Legislature and Gov. Jerry Brown, would represent the most significant change to California's bilingual education policy since voters approved Proposition 227 in 1998 with 60.1% of the vote.”

-- “Grizzly bears in California: Reintroduction push ignites strong emotions,’’ via Mercury News’ Denis Cuff: “Some critics — including the state’s wildlife agency — suggest it would be impractical and unsafe to reintroduce the 800-pound grizzly, also known as the brown bear, to the most populated state in the nation. ‘Reintroducing grizzly bears to California would be idiotic,’ said Pete Margiotta, a Walnut Creek resident and longtime hunter. ‘Somebody is going to get killed.’” http://bayareane.ws/2cKzXdI

But the scores released late Monday may represent more than the state’s periodic fluctuation in national comparisons of reading and math. California’s sinking scores may reflect the SAT’s increasing democratization, with more students at differing levels of preparation taking the exam.” http://bayareane.ws/2ddylIZ

-- “Gauging the Honda-Khanna flap over campaign files,” by Scott Herhold in the Mercury News: “How should anyone judge the flap from last week, when U.S. Rep. Mike Honda accused his rival Ro Khanna and Khanna’s campaign manager of illegally accessing Honda campaign files? Is it politics as usual or something more sinister? There are two ways to gauge this affair, and they spill into one another like the traffic at a busy freeway on-ramp. One is the substance: How serious was the breach, if breach there was? The second is the politics: What impact will it have?” http://bayareane.ws/2dxcJXn

-- PROP. 61 -- “Could California lower drug prices for all Americans?,” by Froma Harrop in the Denver Post: “The pharmaceutical industry has amassed $100 million to defeat the measure.

** A message from Our Health California: Proposition 52 extends a partnership between community hospitals and the state to secure additional federal funding for Medi-Cal. It does not create any new state taxes and the program allows the state to claim unused, federal funds for Medi-Cal patient care. The initiative also prevents legislators from diverting funds intended to pay for medically necessary hospital services for Medi-Cal patients. In the past, the Legislature has diverted hundreds of millions of dollars from the program to pay for things unrelated to health care. Proposition 52 will prevent future raids and make sure the state’s health care safety net is truly that -- protected health care funding for California’s most vulnerable patients.

California voters are being asked to vote on 17 different propositions, which can feel complicated and overwhelming. But one thing is clear: Proposition 52 will directly impact millions of Californians and will ensure that they have access to the health care they need. Proposition 52 has a strong and diverse coalition of supporters with no organized opposition http://politi.co/2dYJ0Kl. **
