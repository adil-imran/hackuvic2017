The Daily 202: Republican politicians fall back in line behind Trump after defecting

WaPo ^ | 12 Oct 2016 | James Hohmann

Posted on by mandaladon

THE BIG IDEA: Now that it has become crystal clear Donald Trump will not quitthat he has unshackled himself and plans to limp across the finish linesome Republicans who called on him to drop out over the weekend are reversing themselves.

The senior senator from Nebraska tweeted this on Saturday:

The comments made by Mr. Trump were disgusting and totally unacceptable under any circumstance. (1/2)

It would be wise for him to step aside and allow Mike Pence to serve as our party's nominee. (2/2)

But yesterday during a radio interview she announced that she will vote for Trump after all. "He decided he would not step aside. I respect his decision," Deb Fischer told the Lincoln radio affiliate KLIN. "I support the Republican ticket, and it's a Trump-Pence ticket. To me, its not a tough choice.

Many Republican elected officials are personally outraged and ashamed by something their partys nominee says or does. So they distance themselves. But as soon as they face a whiff of blowback from some in the party, they cave and fall back in line. -------------Voters elect politicians...

There are no better enemies than Democrats. And No Worst Friends than Republicans. They are fair weather friends of the first order.

-- And NBC/Wall Street Journal polling suggests that some rank-and-file Republicans who defected after the emergence of the 2005 video are coming back into the fold too. Some 83% of Republicans said in post-debate polling that they would vote for Mr. Trump in a head-to-head matchup against Mrs. Clinton, up from 60% in weekend surveys, Monica Langley writes in the Journal.-------------Trump never gives up!

Their phones lines are melting with angry voters, that’s why they are flipping back.

I called Dave Brat’s office (not one of the turncoats) yesterday to make sure they knew that if he supported the weasel Pauly RINO for Speaker, he’d be Cantorized.

The staffer told me their phones had been jammed all day with calls just like mine.

For pity’s sake, it was 11 years ago, and it was guy to guy ‘big talk’. And the one fact that was revealed was that Trump struck out. More importantly, it was “Billie Bush”, nephew of Trump hater, neverTrumper Jeb Bush. And now it’s revealed that the WaPo and NBC didn’t ‘just learn of it and go with it”, but that Bush was saying he had it months ago, at least as early as the Rio Olympics.

To: mandaladon

I have wondered if that whole thing with the tape and Republicans defecting was all staged. First, that tape mysteriously appears. Everyone is outraged. But less than 24 hours into Tape Gate, numerous Republicans had declared they were abandoning their presidential nominee. Over a stupid recording with vile language, they were declaring that they can’t support their nominee. It wasn’t because of ongoing political differences that they shunned their own nominee, it was over that stupid tape. How the heck did all that happen so quickly, unless it was all preplanned and staged. Did Paul Ryan and his boys know about that tape before it was released, and were he and his boys ready to move quickly because of it? Heck, did Ryan or any of his people actually release the tape??? I smell a rat with this whole incident. The disproportionate reaction over something stupid, just seemed so over the top. It hardly seemed like a spontaneous reaction to shocking news.

The Washington Post demonstrates part of the reason why print media is in serious decline. Limping across the finish line? He's dragging the whole reluctant Republican Party Leadership across the line. You don't do that limping puddin-heads.

Getting more people to watch Lou Dobbs on Fox Business News (7:00-8:00 EDT). He is probably the most effective pro-Trump voice on TV. 2. Without wasting effort by trying to name the most contemptible Trump detractor--or diverting attention from the issues crucial to the very survival of America--we need to put into juxtaposition, the insane narrative of the prissy poseurs, as a class, with the issues that are crucial to any American future. Can anyone, that is any rational person, suggest that Donald Trump's mistake in letting a recounting of a sexual fantasy, eleven years ago, be recorded, is 1/100,000th as important as any of a half dozen issues, where he is for America & Hillary Clinton is not. 3. Again, not getting into wasting time, or building a specific barrier against any sanctimonious twit returning to the cause, as a reformed prodigal; we must organize discussions that compare priorities. The more that we focus on what is really important, the stupider & less principled the sanctimonious twits will sound--and the more certain their comeuppance on November 8th. Damn the pseudo intellectual poseurs--for that is what they truly are;--Damn the liars & Damn the lies! Full speed ahead. Trump to the White House!

Trump has fired up the mower and there a$$es are the grass. These idiots are so clueless they are all over the road. So much so they spend a lot of time crossing the middle of it. And like my old granddad used to say: The only two things in the middle of the road is a yellow stripe and dead skunks.

I tried calling the RNC HQ a couple of hours ago. The tone spun to fast busy. THEY DON’T CARE what we think. They’ve turned off their phones. We at Chez Boots and relatives will vote Trump at the top of the ticket and a few local pols. We’re done being Republicans. No more ‘Washington Generals’ party.

I will say “some” are falling back in line. There are others who are not and a couple who came out saying Trump should step down. I hope Ryan does not survive this Coup.



To: Dilbert San Diego

You hit the nail on the head. This explanation makes the most sense. The reaction was too quick, too rehearsed. And over what? An 11 year old tape of a private conversation! Hillary has said and DONE worse, yet they consider her a better choice?! How stupid of them to think Trump would resign.

Cowards. I still won’t vote for them. They follow the herd... they’re nothing like the men who founded our country. Small men without chests. Pathetic worms - I saw them last weekend.

“Not knowing which way the wind is blowing is so cruel for the GOPe politicians.” Yeah, Ryno Ryan farted a couple of days ago and evidently that’s the “wind” they all decided to follow. Unfortunately it left “the stink” on each of them, so now they are paddling upstream against the flow trying to get back in the good graces of their constituents. Hope enough of them loose their seats to send a clear message to the rest that they had better change their ways or they will be gone in 2018.

To: xzins

FWIW, I've gut some friends who don't like either choice thinking Trump with this line of reasoning: Eleven years ago, Billy Bush, a member of the Bush dynasty illegally recorded a conversation with Donald Trump. He preserved it all these years. Now it is used to start a coup by Republican pols who support unrestricted immigration to attempt to assure that Mrs. Clinton will win the election. Why would you vote for the preferred candidate of The Bush Dynasty, Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney, and John Kasich, among others? On another note, Portman came out in support of the coup. I suspect he blew his re-election to the US Senate.

Any Republican who didn’t stand by Trump last weekend is going to lose. Whatever you can say about Democrats, they don’t stab Hillary in the back. Establishment turds need to be flushed down the toilet.

Don't be so negative. I suspect that there are a lot of Trump supporters who are intimidated from saying so around hillaristas. Keep working them. Agree with them that in other elections (such as Portman vs Strickland), make their own choice. But vote Trump as the unencumbered candidate if they want to clean house. President Trump is going to have to set up a new coalition to govern. Better to work with more Dems then let those involved with the coup to stay in office!

He’s up by 15 over strickland. I doubt it will hurt him. He’s a card carrying clinton/bush establishment guy. He should go no higher than senate and should always be primaried.

Once Trump wins, I predict he will ask for Ryan to step down as Speaker of House, and say that he will veto anything Ryan sends to him otherwise.



To: grania

We’re going to have to put country above party. I’m an American first, a conservative second and being a Republican is way down my list of priorities. That’s the way Trump thinks.

It shouldn’t be so public and shouldn’t happen this close to the election but it’s healthy for members of a national party to disagree. If you want to see totalitarian government - which the media claims Trump will bring - look at the Democratic party (and media). After

* the email issue

* the foundation issues

* the wikileaks

* the total lack of accomplishments that have helped anyone

* Bill, women, her role in sex scandals

* many other things After all that I haven’t heard a single DC Democrat say she cannot be president. They must know

* she can’t be trusted - by congress, by allies, by enemy, by citizens, by media

* she may go either way with TPP (important to many)

* she may do anything with the environment/energy (important to many)

* foreign leaders cannot trust her (very dangerous for the country)

* she’s likely to be pro-wall-street

* she makes money-in-politics a non-issue when Citizen’s United has been a HUGE issue for them There have to be democrat politicians who think she’ll be worse than Trump for their state (TPP, terrorism, immigration/jobs, obamacare, etc).

There have to be democrat politicians who don’t want her to be the face of their party for at least 4 years.

But they aren’t allowed to say those things. They must follow the rulers.

Damage Control. DO NOT BELIEVE THESE PHONIES. TAKE NAMES. Fake, insincere support = NO support. From Ryan to down the anti-Trump (R) ticket, they possess ZERO cred. REJECT ALL GOPe! VOTE against them!! TEACH THEM A LESSON!! Suddenly now some of these GOPe vipers now have had a "Road to Damascus" moment after being reminded of the negative ramifications of alienating Trump supporters? BURY THEM in their own political caskets!



To: Heff

>>Too little too late. The race is over. Hillary is going to win and its likely to be a wipe out...<< Don’t bet too much on your forecast (and this isn’t a flame, by the way). Trump has successfully done two things in the last 48 hours. First, by arranging the presser with the women persecuted (yes, persecuted) by Hillary, he brought balance back into the matter. Sure, he’s a potty mouth, but Hillary’s all that and more. She does it with intent to harm. Trump goes after those who’ve wronged him with a vengeance but the rest is just, as he said, locker room talk. As to going after those who’ve wronged him with a vengeance, that’s the second success. He took to Twitter and other venues and called out the GOP candidates who deserted him over the tape. Instead of cowering and apologizing he went after them by calling for their defeat. That call had legs as the calls from his base to their offices indicated. So, in 48 hours Trump essentially defeated a major MSM effort to disqualify him while scaring wavering GOP candidates into backing down on their calls for him to (yet again) withdraw from the race. In other words, he’s bringing them back into line and he’s prepared to jettison the ones who remain rogue. No one else, and I mean no one, in the 17 person line-up in the primaries could have pulled this off. Anyone who bets against Trump in favor of putting Hillary in the White House had better get some good odds, because he keeps winning regardless how poor people say his chances are. And a third longer-term accomplishment: He’s convincing the voters that politicians of both parties tend to stick together and that he’s willing to dump the whole lot in favor of siding with his voters. The question now is whether that grows his base even more, as I suspect it will. After all, he’s taking on the two most despised institutions in America, the mainstream press and DC politicians (of both parties.)

I hope he does. I still think Ryan will be a huge asset to Trump if he’s elected, but he’s walking a high wire here as the Speaker. As GOP candidates return to the fold, Ryan will have an easier time of it. All he did was give them the rope to hang themselves if that’s what they decided.
