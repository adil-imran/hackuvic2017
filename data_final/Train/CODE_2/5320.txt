A missing four-year-old girl who police say was abducted by a man called Wild West Hogs has been found safe and well.

A huge police search had been launched for little Rebecca Lewis after she vanished from her bed on Saturday.

Police released CCTV sightings of her with Hogs - a family friend who had called at her family home in Florida, US, unexpectedly the previous day.

Rebecca was found with Hogs this morning in a hospital car park in Memphis, Tennessee, more than 800 miles from her family home.

Hogs was arrested and remains in police custody.
