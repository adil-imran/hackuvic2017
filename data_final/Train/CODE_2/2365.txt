From 2009 up to 2013, the year the Ukrainian crisis erupted, the Clinton Foundation received at least $8.6 million from the Victor Pinchuk Foundation, which is headquartered in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, a new report claims.

In 2008, Viktor Pinchuk, who made a fortune in the pipe-building business, pledged a five-year, $29-million commitment to the Clinton Global Initiative, a program that works to train future Ukrainian leaders to modernize Ukraine. The Wall Street Journal revealed the donations the fund received from foreigners abroad between 2009-2014 in their report published earlier this week .

Could this be why Hillary is meeting with the Ukraine president next week? $29 million?

She's not meeting with anyone next week. She's poison right now. I'm predicting she will NOT make the debate.

That’s why Secretary Clinton logged more miles than any other Sec of State...she needed to meet the people in person to make the deal and get the money commitment; it amounts to just flying around, picking up pay-to-play checks...they are the Grifters!

I wouldn’t put it past the Clinton campaign to try and run out the clock, believing they hold the Electoral lead. Maybe some small, managed fundraisers, but I can’t see her doing any large-scale events or even the debates unless all of her health issues are one big ruse.

It was Hillary and the corrupt oligarchs who set up the coup in Ukraine. By the time they were able to pull it off, Hillary was no longer Secretary of State. But her appointee Noodlehead (Victoria Nuland) did the job for her!!!! “The era of nation-building is over!”—Donald J. Trump

____________________ Totally agree. Does not matter though. By October it will look as if there is no one running against Trump. Landslide is what comes to mind.

I had to laugh this morning at a clip of Zero bragging that Hillary had logged more miles than any other SofS - and you’re right - she was flying around like a repo agent, collecting those bribery checks.

Her EV lead is GONE! Trump has the lead now, based on the latest polls. Nate Silver finally swung FL, OH, IA and NC to Trump . . . with more to come.

I wonder if there is a betting line on her even showing up? How does one research this topic?



To: GilGil

She is going to do photo ops instead of campaigning. Less chance of a coughing spell or fall, IMO.

Blocking the US pipelines, importantly the Keystone, might be a reason that a Ukraineian pipeline builder might donate since he depends on building pipelines from Russia and all the “istans” to Europe. When the U.S. becomes more independent of international oil by building internal pipelines, then world oil production should be reduced and fewer pipelines needed. You don’t have to have a document signed in blood, a wink and a nod between honorable thieves is all that’s necessary.
