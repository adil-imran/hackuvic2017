Full Title - Eugene Robinson: Trump Isn't Really Going For Black Votes, He's Trying To Convince Moderate White Voters He Isn't Racist

Eugene Robinson weighs in on GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump's "pivot" last week, where he directly appealed to African-Americans.

"It seems obvious to me that he wasn't speaking to African-Americans," he said.

Robinson characterized Trump's appeal to black voters as: "Your lives are miserable, you live in hell."

"That is not the way to appeal to anyone. You know it," Robinson said. "He has been invited to speak to the NAACP, the Urban League, etc. He has declined them all. So, he clearly is talking to white voters in the suburbs of Philadelphia and Washington [Northern Virginia] and he is trying to say he cares about African-Americans too -- In my own condescending, inappropriate and insulting way. I care about them, so I'm not a racist and you can vote for me." (emphasis by RCP staff)

So, I guess Eugene Robinson knows this, because he's an expert on African Americans and racism.

Mitt Romney spoke to the NAACP and Baraq Ubama didn't. A lot of good it did Mitt.

Just as George Soros did the work of the Nazis against his own race, so does Eugene Robinson do the work of his slave masters, against his own race.

Robinson characterized Trump's appeal to black voters as: "Your lives are miserable, you live in hell." No Eugene, Trump's appeal to black voters is best summarized by "Democrat administrations have only made your situation worse. Try something different -- you have nothing lose."



To: Sir Napsalot

He is doing both. It will work. His “what do you have to lose” argument is effective.



To: beethovenfan

“Robinson is an idiot.” Needs repeating.



To: Sir Napsalot

Well, actually, I belong eve Trump hit the nail on the head, and Eugene is pissed about it. His scribe is nothing more than an effort to convince black and liberal white voters to stay on the DNC plantation. Trump hit a nerve and the left is losing it’s collective mind.

""Your lives are miserable, you live in hell." "That is not the way to appeal to anyone. You know it," Robinson said""



That's EXACTLY how the democrats have kept blacks on the plantation for 70 years. "You're lives suck and you're infants incapable of caring for yourself. Vote for us Democrats to provide and care for you."

The Affirmative Action Pulitzer prize winner spoke? He's not going for your vote, Gene, he's going for the poor black guy and gal that have suffered greatly over the many decades of failed, democratic rule.

Trump is going after the left behind and poor that you described in your book, Eugene.



To: Sir Napsalot

Yeah. Trump would improve the inner city, make things good for the gullible democrat faction of blacks just to get white voters

Robinson is too stupid to be an idiot.

Trump may have been invited but both organizations are liberal strong holds. Why would he think he would get a fair chance at being heard?

Eugene Robinson is a village explainer. To quote Gertrude Stein: “excellent if you were a village, but if you were not, not.

He’s right. Trump’s comments are intended for white people who value black approval.



To: Sir Napsalot

EWgene is just miffed that Trump won’t pander for their vote.

Robinson is the modern equivalent of a plantation House N***** and knows his favored position is contingent on pleasing Massa, the white Liberals.

As has been posted here many times today, Eugene is a raciss idjit. If you have had to listen to him more than a few times, you realize that he is a few eggs short of a dozen ... elevator don’t go all the way to the top ... a few cards short of a deck ... etc

Robinson has hafl-a-point. A large number of PTA moms do not want to be called or viewed racist. They voted for Obama for that reason. Even if Trump is sincere about reaching out to Blacks, the biggest vote impact is probably on PTA moms..including the metrosexual moms. Same is true of immigration. Each immigrant/ethnic voter has 3 or 5 voting friends who have no problem with immigranumts legal or illegal. Those 3 to 5 friends out number the actual number of immigrant/ethnic voters. Whether JD Hayworth in AZ or Oberweis in IL or UT or anywhere, the swing voters have too many friends that are illegals. They sit beside them in church. They work beside them. Their kids play together. That friendship is stronger than political rhetoric.

lol. What a gig he has. “It seems...to me.” I’ll bet everything he’s ever said or written could have started with those words. Zero accountability.
