PKR Youth to send 5,000 for Bersih 5 rally, rolls out own convoy

Pledging support for the Bersih 5 rally, Dr Afif said PKR Youth members were also involved in Bersih 2.0's ongoing nationwide convoy and have additionally started the party's own mini-convoys to spread information on the rally.



"The main Bersih event is already supported, but on a daily basis, there's more programmes ― flash mobs, mini ceramahs, programmes to explain, smaller-scale convoys will also be done. It's about mobilising people to go out and we are targeting more of the rural areas as we want everyone to get the info on this Bersih rally," he said.



He confirmed that about 1,000 PKR Youth members will be involved in its mini-convoys and events nationwide, which started since October 1 in support of the rally.



PKR Youth vice-chief Sangetha Jayakumar clarified, however, that the wing is not seeking to be in a confrontation with the anti-Bersih “Red Shirts” movement and its leader, Datuk Jamal Md Yunos.



"We are not interested in a confrontation, that's not the purpose of our convoy, our convoy's purpose is to share info about Bersih and share the message to the youths, that's one of the main reasons we are using motorcycles, our voting population in elections - more than 50 per cent are below 35, so that is our target group we want to target, so our intention is not to confront Jamal and Red Shirts," she said.



Dr Afif said the youth wing is ready to deploy its security team dubbed "Skuad Keadilan" to aid the rally organisers in ensuring safety during the November 19 rally, but said the actual details will be finalised with Bersih 2.0.
