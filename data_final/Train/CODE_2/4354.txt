Moments After Hillary Releases 2015 Tax Returns, Trump.....

YoungCons ^ | 12Aug16 | John S Roberts

Posted on by qaz123

Hillary Clinton released 2015 tax returns today, showing she and Bill earned $10.6 million.

$1,042,000 was donated to charity.

However, $1 million went directly to the Clinton Foundation.

Republican nominee Donald Trump issued a statement on Clintons taxes, saying she released the only records no one wants to see.

BOOOYAHHHHH!!!!!! The debates are going to be a disaster for her. She has no idea what's coming, either because of her arrogance or stupidity, both of which she has a lot of. But, she's never had to go 1on1 with someone like him. However, I think DJT can take it a step further if he's pressed. Put out a statement... I'll turn it all over, when... Obama releases all of his records, details where he was and what he was doing the night of 9/11/2012 and the records/transcripts of the Jeffery Epstein's trial are unsealed. No one will ever ask for his tax returns ever again.

I hear Clinton wants a sit down debate. Maybe she’d be better off bringing in a fainting couch instead of a chair, at least a Lazy Boy.



To: qaz123

i’m hoping Trump shows up with a bright, blinking, tie that would trigger her and i’d have to laugh

99 percent of her ‘charitable donations” she sends to her own ‘foundation’ which keeps 96 percent of the $$$$$ and only donates a claimed 4 percent (and that to an unknown and therfore probably unauditalbe African outfit that supposedly gives out condoms???) she is a CROOK and her taxes prove it! THAT IS WHAT TRUMP NEEDS TO SAY

Did she itemize deductions on Bill’s smelly underwear when given to a charity as she did in Arkansas?



To: faithhopecharity

Listening to talk radio in Atlanta, all the guys are on the right. But the local news crew has a woman, Sabrina ???, that is pretty ridiculous when it comes to her left leaning stance and tone. Trump could shake a kids hand at a rally and she’ll make sound like he gave the kid a flying elbow. She sounded so proud the other day when she talked about how much money the Clintons gave to charity. She failed to state however, that they gave it to themselves.



To: qaz123

$1,000,000 to the Clinton Foundation she controls and which reportedly only pays out a claimed 4% to an unknown African condom charity, probably not auditable and

$42,000 of her putative husband’s underwear again???????? what a crook!!!

To: qaz123

YES exactly. the rest of us give whatever to charities, but they are real charities (we hope) and outfits we do not control ourselves but then again, that’s for just us Sheeple not for our RULING CORRUPTOIDAL CLASS, they give themselves money and get big tax deductions for doing it, too what a crooked bunch of ripoff artists!

I think Trump will release his returns in the last week of October to burst the lib bubble!

Has he been a little loose with some statements......YUP!!!! but at least he’s honest.

Could he have toned down some of the remarks about Fiorina, etc...YUP!!! but he plays for keeps Absolutely no secret that they want to rip his throat out and he knows it. So, I’m sitting here thinking, his tax returns are probably going to be up to snuff. He’s not going to give them any rope to tie the noose. But, I’d also be willing to bet that there isn’t a brain amongst the left that would intelligently know how to evaluate his returns. If/when he does show his cards, and he wins, there could possibly be some people jumping out of windows or stroking out.



To: SarahPalinForPresident2012

I actually don’t care about Trump’s tax returns. He’s under constant audit so certainly his accountants are playing by the rules. Pretty funny that Trump zings her with “the only records no one wants to see”. Short and to the point!

“im hoping Trump shows up with a bright, blinking, tie” I had thought about trying to get into one of the debates between her and Trump with a bright, battery powered flashing LED light like on the back of a bicycle and shine it into her eyes. If five or six people did that it might induce an episode. Alternately just have people start yelling at her to distract her



To: qaz123

“$1,042,000 was donated to charity...” Was that $1,042.00 of used underwear donated? Hillary’s or Slick’s? *BARF*



To: qaz123

Mitt Romney escalated the pressure for Donald Trump to release his tax returns, doubling down on his belief that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee has something to hide. Your imagination can run wild, Romney said in an interview with CNNs Wolf Blitzer on Friday. He continued: He doesnt pay taxes. He doesnt have much income. Hes receiving income from unsavory sources. He has ownership in enterprises that are perhaps associated with unsavory enterprises or nations or groups. Good old Mitt keeps it up. Mitt is either a raving idiot or he is on the take from the government and knows Trump will stop the gravy train. Which do you think it is?

. Mitt is either a raving idiot or he is on the take from the government and knows Trump will stop the gravy train. Mittens is a magic diaper wearing mormon traitor. All he cares about is bringing in more wetbacks to join his cult.

I gonna say that they don’t have dirt on him, but then again, anything is possible. They probably didn’t need to use it in 2012, because they knew it was a lock for obama. But.... 1. He’s been promised to be part of something and he wants back in the spotlight.

2. Like Cruz, Bush and the rest, he’s a sanctimonious bitch who can’t stand the fact that his guy lost to a guy like Trump.

3. While I do think he could have been a decent president, he’s establishment all the way

4. If Trump gets in and he keeps his promises...the gravy train is coming to an abrupt halt for guys like Romney



To: Blood of Tyrants

from what were published here, 4 percent of their money is spent on charity and most of that on one African outfit nobody ever heard of here....that supposedly dispenses free condoms... as if that were the most important thing to do in the whole wide world with charity money? anyway, they reportedly keep something like 96 percent per the reports for adminstrative costs (ha ha) and their charity was reported on a charity rating site as a (I forget the exact wording sorry but anyway something along the lines of) not a good outfit to donate to if you want your money to actually help anyone (other than, obviously, the Clintons),., I don't try to follow this stuff closely so any corrections will be welcome but anyway that was the gist of the published articles , reports here aobut it

Arent the records of the Clinton Foundation public? Madam Benghazi's Secretary of State emails were supposed to be government records. The Clintons are not going to make anything public without a fight.

To: qaz123

During the first debate Trump should announce that his taxes for the last 5 years have been posted online for all to see but only after they make a $100 donation with all proceeds going to support Gold Star families in need.

***Im hoping Trump shows up with a bright, blinking, tie****<< I'm hoping that Trump buys blinking ties and headbands (for the women) from China and gives em away free at all debates! The libs will scoff em up and have no idea why the MSM didn't tell them it might be a problem... Oh... and Candy Crowley should wear sequins to show off her great figure too...

I knew scrutiny would prove the income tax return to be a farce. Only earned over a million in one year? Hell she ‘s earned that much in one week in the past. Need to ask her for ALL of her tax returns including Bills and any shell companies. Bet she digs in in refuses



To: jsanders2001

this is why I don’t care to see Trump’s tax returns. Running such complex businesses, his returns have to be preared by expert CPA firms (and this is a big part of our problem in USA economy, for sure!)

but.... nobody is gonna understand his tax returns, which could easily run into the hundreds of pages and possibly thousands... the difference is, his returns might be honest,. we KNOW Hilliary’s probably are not honest because of how she seems to lie about everything else

To: SarahPalinForPresident2012

I don’t give a DAMN about his tax returns, his wealth came from him NOT the damned government corruption!!! Release your 33 thousand emails !!!!



To: proudpapa

BOOOOMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!



To: faithhopecharity

I agree...he should make them into 85K pages....and give them one copy Then the hypocrite dems will have to use all the pulp trees in the PNW...to make more copies. [Copies which NO ONE will read, based on experience of the LIEberals] Redact half the stuff and watch the heads assplode

"Hes under constant audit so certainly his accountants are playing by the rules." I heard on ABC Radio that the IRS says that Trump has no problem releasing his taxes even if they are under audit. Once again, the IRS under John Koskinen, issued a statement that Trump should have no problem releasing his tax statement even if it is under an audit. I would not trust the IRS under Koskinen, who has been censured by the U.S. House for his involvement in the destruction of emails pertaining to Lois Lerner. This is part of the pattern of the Obama Regime.

No one even with only a half a brain would take advice from that idiot Koskinen.



To: faithhopecharity

< the difference is, his returns might be honest,. we KNOW Hilliarys probably are not honest because of how she seems to lie about everything else One of the reasons I know her tax returns are BS is because I investigate financial fraud on people just like her. I know the type and their m.o. There would be hundreds of pages not a simple several page tax return. People like her will literally have hundreds of shell companies tied to them, all with separate FEINs with both liquid (any account held with a financial I situation) and non-iquid assets linked to them. In court they can lie about their true financial worth with a straight face since all the assets are tied to the shell companies which are considered separate legal entities. Shell companies were invented by lawyers for a reason.

I would like that. Trump is much better at a table than a podium.



To: Aria

That's not it. The tax returns aren't required. He filled out the required disclosures. And many of the politicians returns were page 1 & 2 of the 1040.



To: jonrick46

The IRS SHOULD BE SAYING...IRS forms are confidential and any disclosure is strictly up to the owner.

If I were Trump I ask WHAT did Hil n Bil actually PRODUCE to earn that money? Then I’d report how much taxes accrued to the state, how many humans were employed. on EVERY 15 million I’d earned.

And her daughter receives an annual salary of $600,000 from their foundation?!!! How many CEOs of Fortune 500 companies earn over half a billion dollars a year in straight salary? This supposedly is a CHARITABLE NON-PROFIT!!! This just gives you a sense of what this “foundation” is all about. It’s another Clinton get-rich quick scheme. A racket.
