By Omeiza Ajayi

ABUJA – Apparently peeved by the seeming wave of backlash generated by last week’s launch of a value reorientation campaign, Change Begins with Me, by the federal government, the All Progressives Congress APC has sought the buy-in of Nigerians into the project.

In a Sallah message to Nigerians issued Sunday in Abuja and signed by its national chairman, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, the APC said the project aims to “institutionalise the best practice and time-honoured values of honesty, hard work”, and patriotism.

“The All Progressives Congress (APC) has joined Muslim Faithful across the country in rejoicing over the joyous occasion of Eid-el-Kabir.

“In a bold move to repair our value system that has been badly eroded over the years, on September 8, 2016, President Muhammadu Buhari launched the laudable National Re-orientation Campaign “Change Begins With Me’’. The Party appeals to all Nigerians to be part of this campaign which will institutionalise the best practice and time-honoured values of honesty, hard work, patriotism, abhorrence of corruption, accountability and integrity in our everyday life”, said Odigie-Oyegun.

Since President Buhari launched the new campaign last week, many Nigerians had taken to the social media accusing him of buck-passing by reneging on his electioneering campaign promise of providing Nigerians with the much-needed change in all facets of live.

The statement urged Muslim faithful and indeed all Nigerians to use the occasion of Eid-el-Kabir to pray for the peace, development and prosperity of the country.

“Indeed, Nigeria is today passing through challenging times in its socio-economic life, the Party calls on Nigerians to pray and support the administration as it works assiduously to pull the country out of the present hardships and restore the country on the path (to) growth in all facets.

“Happily, the President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC administration is already employing all legitimate and innovative means to restore the country’s battered economy back to health in the quickest possible time”, the APC added.
