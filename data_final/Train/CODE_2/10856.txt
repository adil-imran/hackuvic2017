RNC member: I am not voting for any Republican who is not backing Trump

CNBC ^ | 10/10/2016 | Lori Ann LaRocco

Posted on by SpeedyInTexas

Over the weekend CNBC learned a page on Facebook called Vote Out Every Republican That Opposes Trump was created, and members like Diana Orrock, Republican National Committeewoman for Nevada, are promoting the page in their status posts encouraging followers not to vote for the candidates who they feel have abandoned the GOP presidential nominee. "As national committeewoman, I am supposed to keep my personal beliefs to myself, but I have never been a party-over-principles type of person. I have always been a principles-over-party individual," she said.

"I am no longer endorsing Joe Heck in the Senate race," explained Orrock. "How hypocritical of him to denounce Trump on comments that were 12 years old and locker room banter? By not endorsing Trump, he is supporting Hillary."

Nor me. Heck in Nevada just lost me and I’m sure many other votes. I spoke with two Trump supporters today and they both shared the same commitment. We will not vote for someone so limp wristed and weak kneed. No way. The Dem candidate may not be any good, but rather vote for her than see another useless Republican elected to stab us in the back whenever the opportunity arises.

That’s the plan I am following. Every Cheap Labor Express Republican needs to be voted out.

Starting with Pauly RINO.

A freshmen Democrat in a D jersey is far less dangerous than a turncoat Speaker Democrat in an R jersey.

We should all write or call our representatives and clearly warn them of the consequences of their actions if they have or are considering repudiating their support for Trump.

I have said this all along.........and I still feel this way: I am voting for TRUMP, and I will not vote for any Republican that will not endorse Trump. Sorry if you can’t understand this position.....I know I’m not the only one, but it’s going down that way. I hope Trump wins and Wins big. GO TRUMP GO!!

The GOP can go right through the UP - RIGHTS! .... and out on the skids. That’s the way I’m voting. The GOP has no record of performance, they have caved to Obama on every point, I will not vote for people that sit on their A==/s and try to hold me hostage with some kind of effed - UP Logic.

Adios to those who haven’t supported Trump’s effort.

Have a nice day.

As Texans we obviously cannot vote for or against Heck but did receive two emails from his group today asking for $. Called his office and had to leave a message because they don’t seem to be answering their phone. We also returned his emails stating no money from our family because he’s not supporting Trump.

I am not voting for McCain. I'm in AZ too. I voted for Kelli Ward in the primary, but sadly, she lost. So I WAS going to suck it up and vote for McCain in the primary. Not now! McCain can eat Shiite and die!

Joe Heck is a Cheap Labor Express stooge.

He had already backed “Comprehensively Screwing Americans Out Of Their Country” just like Rubio, Graham, McCain, etc.

I was all for voting against McConnell last election, even at risk of a Democrat Senate. However, I'm not sure it's the wisest course this time, with Senators. Reason: if the Dems take the Senate, they will have it from early January, and Trump would not come in until January 20. Schumer would push through 2 new SC justices (Bader would resign) and dozens of federal judges in that time. The nation would pay a big price. Get a Republican Senate filled with RINOs like McCain, Heck, Sasse and Flake, and that won't happen. They will perhaps obstruct him on the wall and immigration, but he will have a very bully pulpit to start getting rid of some of them in primaries every 2 years, and the rest will fall in line. As for Paul Ryan and other nevertrumpers in the House, by all means vote them out. The House will stay Republican.

To: Extremely Extreme Extremist

I am not going to reward bad behavior, traitorous candidates that can't stand a little heat. Besides, Heck is a loser, gut feel is that he never had a chance, looks and by all accounts acts tired, worn out, and uninspiring. He blew it trashing Trump. Bye bye. And who's the fool? The person that will vote for someone that folds and either won't stand with them or lies to get their vote in the first place? Don't be a fool, reject these losers instead of empowering them.

“If Trump does not win, the Republican Party is over,” Orrock said flatly. “Party members are willing to forsake our nominee, and that means they are willing to have Hillary take the helm.” “I will resign as RNC committeewoman for Nevada if Trump loses,” Orrock said on “Power Lunch.” “If not endorsing Trump is what the Republican Party stands for, to hell with the Republican Party.” My stand exactly.

He has some unknown loyalty that controls him. Not party, not country, not even his own interests, really. Someone or something owns him.

democratically elected nominee. There is categorically no excuse for any Republican in elected office not supporting the party'snominee. I do not care one iota about the carrier or delicate feelings of any politician. You were elected to do the bidding of your constituents and it you aren't ready to throw yourself on your sword and return to private life than you should not have become a public servant. Get out!

It doesn’t matter if Trump has to deal with a Dem Congress, because he can win it back in ‘18.

I am no longer endorsing Rob Portman in the OH Senate race Nor will I. All I can figure out is that the smug SOB figured that he's so far ahead in the polls that he could afford to endorse Pence instead. (did he think that weaseling would appease enough voters for victory?) Keep in mind that Senator Portman got the ball rolling with gay marriage "in support of his gay son" Trump can build a coalition with a Democratic US Senate. There only a handful of Republican US Senators worth saving.

Don’t worry about the Senate. It’s lost. Either the Dems will take it outright or progressive “Republican” Senators will line up to pull a Jumpin’ Jim Jeffords and give them control.

I would LOVE to kick the moron inslee out of the governor’s mansion (Washington state) but the pubbie candidate refused to support Trump. Now it looks like Trump is the ONLY box that I’ll be checking this election season.

Paul Ryan is a beltway lifer. His brain is full of consultant driven mush. He couldn’t tell his rear from a hole in the ground at this point.

To: grania

It’s all going according the the Trump/Clinton pre-arranged plan. Divide and conquer.



To: Extremely Extreme Extremist; Reno89519

I don’t think so. It’s time for Nevada to go democrat if our republican congressmen, senator, and governor cannot support Trump. We can always start over from scratch next election. We cannot have republicans who will not support the President.



by 37 posted onby Duchess47 ("One day I will leave this world and dream myself to Reality" Crazy Horse)

To: B4Ranch

I had planned on voting for Heck. No longer. Here's the problem with that approach; 1. If you don't vote for the "R" down ballot, you're helping the "D" get elected -- even if you vote for a third party "I". 2. If Trump is going to get anything lasting accomplished, he must have the cooperation of Congress. 3. There is no chance that a Democrat Congress will cooperate with Trump. A Republican Congress is far more likely to do Trump's bidding...if grudgingly. 4. Accordingly, if we want Trump to succeed, we're obliged to vote for the "R" -- as distasteful as that might be.

To: Extremely Extreme Extremist

After Trump wins and the RINOs loose the House and Senate, the surviving Democrats will be more than happy to support President Trump’s agenda because they will want to get re-elected. The rest is executive action. Remember, under President Trump, shutting down the government is a good thing.

To: okie01

I don’t buy that argument any longer. Our current “R”’s are totally supporting Obama and his agenda. They will not support Trump and they will pressure all new republicans to fall in line. If they aren’t vocal in their support of him now that will not change in the future.

Sorry, there is ZERO evidence a Republican Congress will do Trump’s bidding. It will simply be more FU’s like Ryan gave to Trump today.

Frankly speaking...I trust NO ONE..in any GOP "official" position... Coming close to believing them as much as I believe the MSM.... And that is ZERO....



To: SpeedyInTexas

Good for her. The only question is whether I leave Senate line blank against McCain or vote for the Dem. While I know the media won’t cover it, it might be worthwhile to have statistics later that show McCain’s vote DROPPED rather than the Dem’s vote increased.

You’re not rewarding bad behavior, because of who is at the top of

the ticket. That enthusiasm for Trump correlates into successes down ticket as well. If Jeb were the nominee I wouldn’t even be voting.

There won’t be a next election if the Dems win Congress. Unlike the Republicans now, they’re going to use all sorts of powers to shut Trump’s agenda down and cut off funding for his initiatives.
