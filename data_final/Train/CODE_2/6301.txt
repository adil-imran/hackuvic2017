Report: More women joining workforce, but have low wages

Dr Ong Kian Ming said a Penang Institute’s study found that although more Malaysian women had joined the workforce they were taking up low-paying jobs. — File picKUALA LUMPUR, Oct 9 — More Malaysian women have joined the workforce but are unfortunately taking up low-paying jobs or entering unstable employment, a report by think-tank Penang Institute showed.

The think-tank’s Dr Ong Kian Ming presented the report’s findings, where the number of women participating in the workforce went up at a rate of 5.1 per cent year-on-year from 4.3 million to 5.6 million between 2011 and 2015.

He added that 55 per cent of new jobs created after 2010 have been taken up by women, also referring to statistics where 1,185,000 women took up new jobs in 2015 as compared to 983,200 men.

“So more women are participating in the economy, but many of them are engaged in less productive and poorly-paid work,” the general manager of Penang Institute’s KL office said at the launch of the report.

He said that many women have mostly landed jobs at the lower-end and mid-end levels, and have also taken up vulnerable employment by either running their own businesses or working as an unpaid worker in family businesses.

Those in the vulnerable sector will include women who resort to setting up their own night market stalls as it becomes harder for them to get jobs elsewhere, he said.

He noted that the percentage of women in vulnerable employment between 2011 and 2015 rose at a higher rate from 34 per cent to 44 per cent, while the rate of men involved in the same sector grew at a relatively slower rate.

A similar trend saw women continuing to account for most of the unpaid family workers in Malaysia, with 63.2 per cent in 2011 and growing to 70.1 per cent by 2015.

Malaysia managed to create 2.2 million new jobs in the 2011-2015 period, which already fulfils 75 per cent of the targeted 3.3 million new jobs by 2020 under the government’s Economic Transformation Programme (ETP), but it has purportedly lagged behind its aspirations to shift the country to more mid-scale and high-skilled jobs.

The majority of new jobs since the ETP’s introduction are largely in middle and low-skilled jobs such as in the wholesale and retail sector, where 474,000 were created in the 2010-2015 period out of the 595,000 targeted by 2020, the report showed.

According to Ong, many of those who take up sales jobs in the wholesale and retail sector are women.

While crediting government agency TalentCorp for the increased number of females in the local workforce with its efforts to retain and attract women to return to work, Ong highlighted that there is still a “lingering barrier to promotion to higher employment levels” for women.

“So more women are being employed in high-skilled jobs, but the proportion of women who are holding managerial positions are still relatively low,” he said.

The number of women in high-skilled jobs has been going up, reaching 40.8 per cent in 2015, while women in managerial positions face a “glass ceiling” and have stagnated over the past five years to reach 22.5 per cent in 2015, he highlighted.

Developed nations experience a “double-peaking” in their workforce where women’s labour participation reach a peak in the 25 to 35 age group, before falling off as many leave to start a family. They subsequently hit a second peak when their children are old enough to be sent off to day care.

But Malaysia does not experience the double-peak scenario except for women in managerial positions, which indicates that the creation of new jobs may only benefit women who have not started a family, he said.

The report titled “Malaysia’s Labour Market and Job Creation under the Economic Transformation Programme (2011-2015)” was prepared by Lim Ping Jun.

The full report is expected to be released next week on Penang Institute’s website.
