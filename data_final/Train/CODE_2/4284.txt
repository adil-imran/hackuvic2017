UK To Build A Wall To Keep Out Calais Migrants

Breitbart ^ | 09/07/16 | Liam Deacon

Posted on by Enlightened1

Just two months after voting to leave the European Union (EU), the UK has announced the construction of a great wall near its most porous border in Calais, to keep illegal migrants out.

The UKs southern border checks are conducted in northern France and attempted illegal crossing have more than quadrupled in recent years. UK Border Force guards on French soil stopped 84,088 illegal immigrants last year, figures released last month show.

The new 13-foot (4 metre) high wall will be built of smooth concrete, making it hard to climb, and will line the roads into the port town of Calais where the entrance to the channel tunnel also sits.

We are going to start building this big, new wall as part of the £17 million package we are doing with the French, the UKs immigration minister Robert Goodwill told a parliamentary committee yesterday, the Telegraph reports.

We have also invested in space for 200 lorries at Calais so that they have somewhere safe to wait, he added.

Hilarious. But be sure to keep Trump out of your country you twits

I’m confused. Forward defense is nice, but aren’t Calais and the Chunnel entrance in France?

Mexico wants to build a wall on its southern border. Trump said this in the press conference. Hinted we might help them with a wall in the south and north. Btw, an American bringing a fridge across the border pays a 16% tax on its value. If we charge that on the billions going home in cash to Mexico every year, that’d pay for the wall many times over.

This is GREAT news. An “I told you so” for Trump, especially during the debates. At least some will think “well if the Brits are doing it and they’re so progressive, maybe it ain’t such a bad idea”

UK must have lease and easement rights on that land that serves the east end of the tunnel.

This problem will not be solved until authorities in these countries start valuing the lives of these invaders exactly as the invaders value their lives. We all know that really means.

A 13’ wall is not a “Great Wall”.

We need to stop the flow of money out of our communities and into dead end Mexican economies. I speak spanish and many of the illegals speak english and they tell me a lot of the money they make they send home. Nice enough folks we talk respectfully but the reality is the money they make leaves our economy and never returns. I know one guy he says he legal but I suspicious anyhow he really doesn't even want to be here but he has a daughter who is very sick - I know this man and he works his ass off and sends every dime he can for her care - its all wacked, but he can't make near the money he needs there and the system so rigged you can't entrepreneur your way out. Mexico is such a mess then we've become they're safty net. The first wall can be erected immediately and its the financial wall. Lets make one that would make Jamie Gorelick proud. Divisions of the invading Army will retreat if the spigot gets turned off. Those recalled workers will force the political reality of Mexico to change as it must. All of our Mexico immigration problems are a symptom of the blatant and rampant nepotistic corruption that is the Mexican government and cast system. Its time Mexico had its domestics quarrels settled in their own house! Nov 9 fire all illegal workers folks because if you like your gardner hmm you might not be able to keep him. By the way the illegal gardners around here do a lousy job

All these illegal aliens need to go home and take care of business of their country. their country needs shaking up and they need to do it.

That’s right, they’ve managed to export a generation of young men of military age with revolutionary tendencies somehow making it OUR problem. Time for their chickens to come home to roost-ah.

Good point and I believe their hearts are not into that. They watch citizens murdered, women raped and their towns and cities turned into Mideast ghetto no go zones.England, France, and Germany may be demographically at the point of no return.

Mexico can “pay” for our wall if we simply suspend the half-billion+ dollars in annual foreign aid we send them...



To: Enlightened1

Holy Cow! “UK Border Force guards on French soil stopped 84,088 illegal immigrants last year, figures released last month show.” A lot of British have had it up to their ears with the immigrants ruining their country. Especially the one sthat don’t live in Londonistan. My oldest daughter lives in the UK with her British husband. She is 1/2 Chinese and looks vaguely middle-eastern because of the mixed heritage. Once or twice a month she get yelled at by locals in Manchester who think she’s Pakistani

Im confused. Forward defense is nice, but arent Calais and the Chunnel entrance in France? It's like Toronto's Lester Pearson airport. You go through U.S. customs in Toronto. Half the terminal is U.S. territory for purpose of customs and immigration. In Calais, you go through British customs in there, and are admitted to an area, which includes the entrance, that is Britain for the purpose of immigration.
