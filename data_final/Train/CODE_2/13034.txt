Ukraine should not be an EU member: Dutch prime minister

Europe March 31, 2016

Ukraine should never become a member of the European Union, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said in an interview with news website Nu.nl. Speaking a week before a controversial referendum in the Netherlands on the EUs treaty with Ukraine, Rutte said Ukraine has an important buffer role between the EU and Russia. The Netherlands is against EU membership for Ukraine because we think that Ukraine should have a good relationship with Europe and Russia. And that would not be possible if it was part of the European Union. In the long term, Ukraine must develop a stable relationship with Russia, he said. Opponents of this treaty say that it is a step towards EU membership. That is not what it is about. The referendum, Rutte said, is about a treaty which is of great importance to the Netherlands. It is about stability on the edge of Europe in an unstable world. The treaty is of great importance and I have great faith in the results. At least 30% of the electorate have to vote in the referendum for it to have any legal weight. The referendum is only advisory and the Dutch government has already voted for the treaty.

It would just be another member where we’re paying for their defense. Trump is right about NATO and we’re paying most everyone’s bill.



To: boycott

that’s great!! England and Clinton sign a pact saying they have Ukrain’s back if only they’d get rid of the nukes. Then everyone sells them up the river. I know, the pact didn’t call for their defense, but they got suckered and it’s sad. but let millions of muslims in!!! like it matters what W Europe says. They’re one simultaneous nuke attack from terrorists of being irrelevant. or it will be the slow and painful way of no babies for them and 6 for the muzzies.



To: boycott

The idiots of EU / NATO globalism almost started WW3 over a bunch of Galician Ukrainian hicks with a Nazi fetish. Enough.

I agree they should not join the European Union socialists. All they will get is migrants from the Middle East and North Africa.

thats great!! England and Clinton sign a pact saying they have Ukrains back if only theyd get rid of the nukes. Then everyone sells them up the river. --------- There was no pact - it was a memorandum aka a gentleman's understanding. And the EU/USA violated it by getting involved in the internal affairs of the Ukraine by organizing a coup against the legitimate govt there.

so now we just say #### ‘em? that’ great!!! So you’re saying we ####ed it up but they’re the ones that are #####ed? go America!! go England!!!



To: PD1966

from that point of view, it is a good thing they don’t



To: boycott

forget that annoying “gentleman’s agreement” what being good for one’s word worth anyway?



To: Trumpinator

The Ukranians didn’t help us at all over the last 25 years, then their left-wingers come crying to Soetoro to help them kill off conservatives. They can go pound sand.

Yes - there was a Fk up and we almost had WW3 over an artificial nation that is split down the middle along cultural lines and EU / NATO integration should never have been attempted. Ukraine is best left as a neutral “Finland” type of country. A buffer state.

“thats great!! England and Clinton sign a pact saying they have Ukrains” The pact was signed with an entity that went out of existence when it was overthrown in a street putsch. When you have a coup, you don’t get to demand all the things that the legitimate government was owed. You only get obligations and real estate that you can seize by force. That’s the whole concept of how a coup works.

To: DesertRhino

Any European nation that doesn’t want to be over run with Muslim needs to align with Russia.



To: DesertRhino

a coup backed by the Western Countries!! and then we $#### them!! at least there’s a huge land mass that putin’s not touching. we’ve become weasels and that’s a shame. I don’t want to defend all of Ukraine, but Russia should not go any further into it or we should send military supplies.



To: Trumpinator

a proud man once said “you’re only as good as your word” I don’t want to go to war over Ukraine but we should have NEVER pushed them to make that deal. Reagan would NEVER EVER EVER have. at least what putin has is a very tiny piece. it needs to stay that way. I respect your posts but you have to admit what Clinton and Britain did was wrong. and if we helped with the coup, that was twice as wrong to leave them on their own



To: dp0622

To me it was sleepwalking into a potential World War akin to sleepwalking into a 1914.

arms delivery. we’ve done that a million times before. just because Clinton was a sc#mbag, doesn’t mean we should have left them in the lurch no troops. but real arms. what Russia has now is the sea and a buffer that they wanted. what’s where it should end. poor Ukraine. everyone but them knew not to trust a Clinton. and now we have another one.



To: Trumpinator

The Dutch remember who shot down the passenger jet.



To: Trumpinator

Ukraine was run by a Soviet puppet, now there is more freedom. They are not Nazi’s, but you are entitled to your opinion. GO TRUMP !



To: Trumpinator

Given the current situation of the EU, better for Ukraine to remain unaligned.

Yes, and they don’t want to piss off the Russians any farther. Who knows what the vodka-sodden Soviet Bolsheviks will do next?



To: Trumpinator

Yes! What we need is an agreement. Like Molotov-Ribbentrop. It would solve everything.



To: PD1966

Who in their right mind would want membership in that sinking ship EU now?

Anyone who wants nothing to do with the Russians, for starters.



To: dp0622

This announcement by Dutch prime minister is actually helping Ukraine. Dutch are having a referendum about whether to approve a free trade deal between Ukraine and EU. There is a movement painting scary images saying that approving the free trade deal would mean that Ukraine is in the EU. The prime minister said that is not the case and urged the voters to approve the deal. Trumpinator of course leaves this out.



To: Objective Scrutator

Ukraine sent their soldiers to Iraq to help.



To: Trumpinator

Who would want to be, you will all be slaves to islam in another 5 years when the population is the majority and heads will roll, enjoy



To: Krosan

big piece to leave out. Thank you very much.



To: PD1966

Ukraine was run by a Soviet puppet, now there is more freedom. They are not Nazis, but you are entitled to your opinion. GO TRUMP ! --- That is false on all counts - the last legit leader of the Ukraine played both sides of the equation. He frustrated Putin as much as he did the west. And I get why the pro coup side wants to deny the Nazi element but it sounds like Muslims denying the jihadi elements in their Arab spring movement at this point.

I left nothing out - the article is posted in full from the Dutch news source. http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2016/04/88027-2/ The Netherlands one of five lands blocking Ukraine EU membership The Netherlands is one of five European countries which have consistently blocked moves to open the way for Ukraine to join the EU, the Volkskrant says on Friday. Germany, France, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands all refused to allow any openings to Ukraine, despite the efforts of Britain, Sweden, Poland and the Baltic states during five years of treaty talks, the paper says. It bases its claims on diplomatic sources. Read more at DutchNews.nl: The Netherlands one of five lands blocking Ukraine EU membership http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2016/04/88027-2/

To: Trumpinator

i’m with you man. as long as putin doesn’t go in any further. he’s just barely inside Ukraine. but we should send heavy arms if they ever try to go deeper, which they probably wont because they can barely afford a one front war in Syria.



To: Trumpinator; dp0622

Strange article. It leaves out that Rutte also said he urges the Dutch voters to vote Yes on the free trade treaty. Here is the interview in question in Dutch - http://www.nu.nl/politiek/4238959/interview-rutte-we-moeten-wens-van-rusland-niet-belonen.html - you can use auto translate. Pretty clear that the English article was quote mining and made it seem like Rutte is advocating NO when in fact he is advocating YES.



To: Krosan

free trade is not EU membership.



by 35 posted onby Trumpinator ("Are you Batman?" the boy asked. "I am Batman," Trump said.)

To: Trumpinator

Exactly. And free trade is what the referendum is about. There is a camp that wants to make it about something else and spreads the FUD saying a Yes vote would mean Ukraine becomes a EU member. That is why Rutte said he doesn’t think Ukraine should become a EU member, but the referendum is not about that and urges people to vote Yes.
