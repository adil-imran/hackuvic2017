While we have sufficient funds on hand to commence business operations, our cash reserves may not be sufficient to meet our obligations for the next 12-month period. As a result, we may need to seek additional funding in the near future. We currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. At this time, we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock to meet our obligations over the next 12 months. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future equity financing.

We do not currently own any significant plant or equipment that we will seek to sell in the near future. We do not anticipate the need to hire employees over the next 12 months with the possible exception of secretarial support should our business grow and necessitate such expenditure. We believe the services provided by our sole officer and director are sufficient at this time. We believe that our operations are currently on a small scale and are manageable by one individual.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.
