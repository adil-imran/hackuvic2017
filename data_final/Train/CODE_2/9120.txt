WASHINGTON, Sept. 23 (Xinhua) -- One man was fatally shot and another suspect detained Friday by police in the U.S. city of Baltimore, Maryland, local media reported.

The shooting took place in the Brooklandville area in north of Baltimore, where police were responding to a robbery at the Wells Fargo Bank in the 1500 block of Reisterstown Road, the reports said.

The victim was shot while fleeing the scene in a car, and the second suspect, reportedly involved in multiple other recent bank robberies, was wounded and taken to a hospital for treatment, police spokesman John Wachter was quoted as saying.

Wachter said one of the police officers was wearing a body camera, but the police video was not reviewed yet. It remained unknown whether the officer with the camera was the one who fired the weapon.

The identities of the victim and the second suspect were not released.

Friday's shooting followed two other recent deaths of people engaged in some ways with county police, according to a report by The Baltimore Sun.

A 21-year-old man named Tawon Boyd died on Wednesday after he was wounded in a confrontation with police on Sunday in Essex.

The police have also been criticized for the death of Korryn Gaines, 23, who was fatally shot by an officer in her apartment last month. Police said she pointed a shotgun at the officers during the standoff.

The Friday shooting also came after three days of protests and violence in the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, that were sparked by Tuesday's fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, a black man, by a local police officer.
