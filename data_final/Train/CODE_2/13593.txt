after authorities believed she was a wanted fugitive because her hair is very short

A breast cancer patient says she was mistaken for a Missouri fugitive because her hair was shaved due to chemotherapy treatments.

Erin Peters, 35, said she felt humiliated when she was handcuffed and questioned when she was stopped Friday at an Idaho Walmart after being mistaken for 18-year-old Whitley Evenson.

Evenson, of Independence, Missouri, is charged with killing her six-week-old baby, Derek Walker, in September 2015, The Coeur d'Alene Press newspaper reported.

'I felt humiliated in front of Walmart, crying,' Peters said after being questioned for 45 minutes.

Peters said members of the North Idaho Violent Crimes Task Force believed she was the Missouri fugitive because her hair is very short.

She said she shaved her hair because of cancer treatments.

Task force members went through her purse, her phone and her Facebook account, 'ransacking everything', she said.

'The way they went about this was so wrong,' Peters added.

FBI spokesman Richard Collodi said he regrets that Peters was inconvenienced but the task force had to be sure.

He said suspects often come up with creative excuses to avoid arrest.

Evenson was booked into Kootenai County jail until she can be extradited back to Jackson County, Missouri, where she is charged with second-degree murder. Prosecutors accused Evenson of suffocating her infant, Derek Walker (pictured)

'I'm confident she was treated professionally,' Collodi said.

The task force had information Evenson would be at that Walmart, Collodi said,

Evenson was arrested later on Friday at the store.

She was out on bond when she failed to appear for a court hearing in July.

Evenson was booked into Kootenai County jail until she can be extradited back to Jackson County, Missouri, where she is charged with second-degree murder.

Jackson County prosecutors accused Evenson of killing her son by putting her hand over the childâ€™s mouth until he suffocated.

Police said Evenson and her boyfriend, Leo Walker, had broken up five days before the child's death and he had moved out, according to KMBC.

Walker and the baby's grandmother believe that Evenson killed the baby as revenge for the breakup.

The couple also has a one-year-old daughter, who Evenson's brother has been raising.
