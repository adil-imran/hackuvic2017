Now I Know, and So Do You (The Muslim immigration into Europe)

When the massive influx of Muslims occurred earlier this year, I couldnt understand why? How could so many people just up and leave their home countries to walk to Europe? How could so many people get the word and decide at the exact same time to get up and go? It didnt make sense but it happened. This article below explains it all. Remember, I am an Islamaphobe and am not to be trusted when it comes to bashing Muslims. What is Hijrah?

We understand far too little about Muslims leaving their homes. What is Hijrah? Obama is well educated in the Muslim religion since he studied it while living in Indonesia. He does not want this email to be spread all over the US because he wants us to be totally ignorant of what is really going on with the ISIL movement. This makes all the turmoil now make sense. Sad, and doesnt bode well for us.

What is a Hijrah? Hijrah is when large scale mass migrations become invasions. What is happening in parts of Europe right now, actually appears to be a hijrah as the Quran describes it. This is NOT going to end well. Because it appears the policies of the liberal socialist leaders in Europe and the US do not want to keep their lands from being overrun.

Why? I couldnt figure out why other Arab countries (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Oman, etc.) werent taking in refugees, so I started digging. Hijrah is jihad by emigration. It means moving to a new land in order to bring Islam there and is considered in Islam to be a holy and revered action. And whoever emigrates for the cause of Allah will find on the earth many locations and abundance, and whoever leaves his home as an emigrant to Allah and His Messenger and then death overtakes him, his reward has already become incumbent upon Allah. Surah 4:100.

So, if a Muslim dies in the process of immigrating to another country, thats essentially the same as being a suicide bomber, his reward is automatic. This explains the great eagerness to undertake such a perilous journey. Muhammad and his followers emigrated from Mecca to Yathrib/Medina in 622 CE. It was there that he became a military leader though still uneducated. This is where all the commands to commit violence against unbelievers originated. Its important to note that the Islamic calendar marks this as the beginning of Islam.

This current massive hijrah was announced last January, although few Muslim countries paid the announcement much attention. A supporter (or member) of ISIS uploaded a document in Arabic that urged Muslims to get to Libya because of its proximity to southern Europe and for the important tactical value of its illegal immigration circuits to facilitate infiltration of European cities. Libya has a long coast and looks upon the southernmost countries of western European, which can be reached with ease by even a rudimentary boat.

In February, transcripts of telephone intercepts published in Italy said ISIS was threatening to send 500,000 migrants as a psychological weapon against Europe. The Italian Minister for the Interior, Angelino Alfano, said at the time, If the militias of the Caliphate advance faster than the decisions of the international community how can we put out the fire in Libya and stem the migration flows? We are at risk of an exodus without precedent. Also in February, the Turkish intelligence service warned police that up to 3,000 trained jihadists were seeking to cross into Turkey from Syria and Iraq and then travel through Bulgaria and Hungary into western Europe and then into the rest of Europe. Sound familiar? In May, a Libyan government adviser warned that Islamic State operatives were being smuggled to Europe in migrant boats. ISIS is profiting from the human trafficking trade, forcing boat owners to hand over their profits or be killed. Some ISIS operatives are already sheltered in safe houses in the south of the Europe.

Groups of men, 17 to 25, from Palestine and Syria, cross into Bulgaria and from there move into the rest of the EU. A former Al Qaeda double agent told the BBC that he knew of two Egyptian brothers who reached Italy from Libya, accompanied by men who were deeply religious and fluent in Italian and French.

Go watch the videos of those refugees again. How many of the refugees are 17-25 year old men and of military age? If that doesnt convince you, we already know terrorists are coming through with the waves of refugees: a week ago five men were arrested attempting to cross the Bulgarian-Macedonian border with Islamic State propaganda, specific Jihadists prayers, and decapitation videos on their phones. They had been posing as refugees.

UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage warned: I fear we face a direct threat to our civilization if we allow large numbers of people from that war torn region into Europe.

Other Muslim countries are not taking in these refugees because this is a hijrah into Europe. This is no humanitarian crisis. It is an invasion. Its goal is to transform Europe: overtax its economies, tear down its wealthiest nations, re-draw the demographics and, of course, the culture.

Obama, has already announced over 100,000 are going to arrive in the USA in 2017.

The Muslim-controlled U.N./NWO cabal has declared WAR on Christianity and Caucasian-majority culture, including the U.S., Germany, Sweden, etc.. For perspective and as an example, the SAME entities who fund Hillary's campaign are the same entities who fund, control and direct ISIS: The Muslim-controlled U.N./NWO cabal. It would be difficult for these nations' own ARMY to just outright kill its own citizens and get away with it, SO THEY HAVE CREATED AND APPOINTED MUSLIM TO DO THE JOB. We ain't seen NOTHIN' yet.

Pity we have leaders unwilling to refuse all Muslim immigrants. Instead they seem to be trying to keep Christian refugees at bay. This is probably because in the blinkered world view of western secularists Christians are the enemy and whatever dilutes their numbers in society is deemed good by them. That obviously includes importing Islam if that’s what it takes.
