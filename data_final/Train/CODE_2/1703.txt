The two rhinos killed at the hands of poachers in South Africa during September are the first to be slayed for their horns in the area since the all-female 'Black Mambas' group was formed in 2013. The two rhinos, one of which was pregnant, were shot dead and their horns hacked off by poachers on a full moon night, underlining the crisis that threatens the species.The Black Mambas, an anti-poaching group,  are made up of 36 unarmed female rangers, aged from 19 to 33, based at the Balule Game Reserve in Limpopo province on the edge of Kruger National Park.Female members of the anti-poaching team Black Mambas conduct a routine patrol through a wildlife reserve in September 25, 2016 They have been feted worldwide as a mould-breaking experiment that has successfully helped to tackle poaching through foot patrols, intelligence gathering and community awareness work.But the insatiable appetite for rhino horn in Vietnam and China has fuelled record killings in Africa, and the Black Mambas are struggling under growing pressure.'It was so horrible. It feels like our fault,' Collet Ngobeni, 32, who has been with the team since they were founded, told AFP.Protected Rhinos roam and feed in an enclosed precinct at the Kahya Ndlovu Lodge in Hoedspruit,Limpopo 'We need to be more prepared. Three rhinos (including the unborn calf) means a lot.'There are greedy people about who don't think of the future.'The recent deaths in Balule were in a remote area where rhinos rarely roam and had never been targeted by poachers before, so it was not covered by a regular patrol.The Black Mambas-named after a venomous snake- won the UN 'Champions of the Earth' award last year, which Ngobeni travelled to New York to collect in a blaze of publicity.And they have been singled out for praise at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) conference currently underway in Johannesburg.The Black Mambas- named after a venomous snake- won the UN 'Champions of the Earth' award last yearBut Ngobeni is frustrated by a lack of resources that she believes is holding the team back.'All the attention has not been translated into help,' she said.'If we step back, the poachers come again. Our vehicles are often broken down and we don't have enough equipment.'To go forward, we need more training, more money and more people.'Members of the Black Mambas are paid by the government, earning a take-home monthly pay of between 3,000 and 3,500 rand ($220 to $255)-a low salary even by South African standards.After 21 days of back-to-back shifts, they get 10 days off to visit their families and children.A debrief after a routine patrol in the Limpopo province of South Africa.

There are difficult circumstances, but I do still love it.'Rhino horn is trafficked to east Asia where it is deemed to be a miracle cure for everything from cancer to lack of virility -- and demand is soaring.Black Mambas collect wire traps from a wildlife reserve in Hoedspruit. A record number of rhinos were poached last year in Africa In 2008, less than 100 were poached, but numbers have rocketed alarmingly since as illegal trafficking networks channel rhino horn from Africa to overseas markets.Last year, a record 1,342 rhinos were poached in Africa, according to a count before the CITES meeting, with nearly 1,200 of them killed in South Africa alone.'The Black Mambas have brought crucial attention to the rhino crisis,' said Pitso Mojapelo, project manager at the Department of Environmental Affairs.'We pay their salaries, and hope other donors will be able to come in to support their work further.'They have really proven themselves and we would like to duplicate the idea elsewhere.'The CITES conference has seen heated debate on controversial plans to legalise rhino horn trade, with some campaigners saying that providing a legal supply of farmed horn is the only way to end poaching.Copy link to paste in your messagePublished by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group
