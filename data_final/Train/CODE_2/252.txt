There was a sense of relief at the BJP headquarters following news of the surgical strikes, which came just as the party rank and file was getting restive after the Uri attack. Party leaders lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the armed forces.

BJP president Amit Shah, who had issued a hard-hitting statement at Kozhikode a day after Modi's combative speech at Kozhikode promising the sacrifice of the 18 soldiers will not go in vain, said a befitting reply had been given to terrorists.

"After a long battle against terrorism, for the first time, damage was inflicted on the breeding centres of terrorism and a befitting reply given to terrorists. Today, all countrymen feels proud of the army," Shah said in a statement issued on Thursday.

Congratulating the PM, defence minister Manohar Parrikar and Indian Army, Shah said the army has shown exemplary valour and courage by carrying out surgical strikes on the launching pads and trainning camps of terrorists in PoK.

Shah had earlier issued a series of tweets on similar lines.

That the strikes had left a feeling of contentment in the party was apparent from the statements of the leaders.

BJP general secretary Ram Madhav said the Prime Minister has "walked the talk. . Punishing the perpetrators of terror from across has begun."

He said some Pakistanis were trying to downplay it claiming it was just a cross LoC firing.

The party, which faces elections in the crucial Uttar Pradesh early next year, was concerned about the political fallout if the government had not responded in line with the BJP's line of zero tolerance towards terror.

"A salute to the armed forces and to the leadership of the Prime Minister for securing our borders and defending from Pakistan sponsored terrorism. A responsible government acts and talks less. And that has been the practice of this government under Modi's leadership," party national secretary Sidharth Nath Singh said.

Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad tweeted "Surgical strikes were conducted when Pakistan did not mend ways after repeated diplomatic efforts to check terrorism originating from their soil."
