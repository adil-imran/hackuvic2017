NEW DELHI: A Pakistani journalist, who last week reported an exclusive story for Dawn newspaper on abetween the Nawaz Sharif government and Pakistan's army, was today put on an 'Exit Control List', which means Islamabad can stop him from leaving the country.The journalist, Cyril Almeida, tweeted about this development just past midnight today.Dawn stood by its story, in a note published on its website by its Editor."The story that has been rejected by Prime Minister's Office as a fabrication was verified, cross-checked and fact-checked...Therefore, the elected government and state institutions should refrain from targeting the messenger, and scape-goating the country's most respected newspaper in a malicious campaign," Dawn's statement said.Just yesterday, Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ordered "" against those responsible for publishing the Dawn article, or what the PM called a "fabricated" story, PTI reported."The participants were unanimous that the published story was clearly violative of universally acknowledged principles of reporting on national security issues and has risked the vital state interests through inclusion of inaccurate and misleading contents which had no relevance to actual discussion and facts," said an official statement.The statement was issued after a meeting yesterday, which was attended by Pakistan's chief of army staff General Raheel Sharif, , PM Sharif, finance minister Ishaq Dar, interior minister Nisar Ali Khan, Punjab chief minister Shahbaz Sharif and top spy, the ISI's Lieutenant General Rizwan Akhtar.In the October 6 exclusive report, Almeida wrote that the civilian Pakistani government told officials of the country's all-powerful army that the country faces international isolation if it doesn't crack down on terrorist groups operating within its borders. Almeida further reported that government officials complained that action was taken against suspected terrorists "the security establishment has worked behind the scenes to set the arrested free."Almeida's report was published a week after India conducted surgical strikes on terrorist camps in Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir. The September 29 strikes were in retaliation for the September 18 terrorist attack in Uri in Jammu and Kashmir by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammad terrorists. As many as 19 soldiers died in the assault on the Uri army post.
