Highlights 1 Google street view accidentally blurs cow's face.

2 Google first implemented face-blurring in 2008

3 Picture of face-blurred-bovine goes viral with 12,000 retweets.

Of all the things, Google's face-blurring software decided to hide the identity of a large cow. The google street view started panoramic views of places from the ground, back in 2008. To maintain privacy the search giant blurs license plates, people, some buildings and for some reason cows too.

Guardian US editor and writer David Shariatmadari tweeted an image of the anonymous cow on Monday with the message "Great to see Google takes cow privacy seriously."

The face-blurred-bovine chilling near a river in rural Cambridge, UK, has milked it's five minutes of online fame with a whopping 12,000 retweets.

When the BBC got in touch with Google, they gave in a pun-filled response saying, 'We thought you were pulling the udder one when we herd the moos, but it's clear that our automatic face-blurring technology has been a little overzealous.'



And what followed was a laughriot among Twitter users
