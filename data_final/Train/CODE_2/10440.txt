THE BIG IDEA: Now that it has become crystal clear Donald Trump will not quit — that he has “unshackled” himself and plans to “limp” across the finish line — some Republicans who called on him to drop out over the weekend are reversing themselves.

The senior senator from Nebraska tweeted this on Saturday:

The comments made by Mr. Trump were disgusting and totally unacceptable under any circumstance. (1/2) — Deb Fischer (@DebFischerNE) October 8, 2016

It would be wise for him to step aside and allow Mike Pence to serve as our party's nominee. (2/2) — Deb Fischer (@DebFischerNE) October 8, 2016

But yesterday during a radio interview, she announced that she will vote for Trump after all. "He decided he would not step aside. I respect his decision," Deb Fischer told the Lincoln radio affiliate KLIN. "I support the Republican ticket, and it's a Trump-Pence ticket.... To me, it’s not a tough choice.”

Darryl Glenn, the Republican nominee against Sen. Michael Bennet in Colorado, said Saturday that Trump must step aside. “America cannot have a man who speaks this way about women be the face of our country to the Free World,” he said in a statement.

But facing backlash from Trump supporters, Glenn — who already has no realistic path to victory — backtracked. He says watching the debate Sunday night changed his mind. “Donald Trump did what he absolutely had to do,” Glenn said on Fox News. “I think he reset this campaign.”

-- It has truly been a surreal cycle to watch. Many Republican elected officials are personally outraged and ashamed by something their party’s nominee says or does. So they distance themselves. But as soon as they face a whiff of blowback from some in the party, they cave and fall back in line. Then they offer up excuses and rationalizations, twisting themselves into pretzels to justify voting for a guy who some will tell you privately is a danger to the Republic. It’s happened over and over again now, and it validates what Trump himself said during the primaries: Many politicians are indeed craven and interested mainly in maintaining power for themselves, principles be damned.

-- And NBC-Wall Street Journal polling suggests that some rank-and-file Republicans who defected after the emergence of the 2005 video are coming back into the fold, too. “Some 83% of Republicans said in post-debate polling that they would vote for Mr. Trump in a head-to-head matchup against Mrs. Clinton, up from 60% in weekend surveys,” Monica Langley writes in the Journal.

-- So what would it take for these Republicans to actually dump Trump? Dogged by accusations of corruption as he ran for governor of Louisiana in 1983, Edwin Edwards told reporters: "The only way I can lose this election is if I’m caught in bed with either a dead girl or a live boy." The Democrat won.

Earlier this year, Trump boasted in Iowa: "I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters.”

We were reminded of both these quotes during Blake Farenthold’s appearance on MSNBC last night. Asked by host Chris Hayes whether he would still support Trump even if the Republican nominee said on tape that he liked raping women, the congressman from Texas suggested he might — eventually adding he'd “consider it.”

“Again — it depends — you don't know the entire context of all of this,” he said. “That would be bad, and I would have to consider — I'd consider it. But again, we're talking about what Donald Trump said 10 years ago as opposed to what Hillary Clinton has done in the past two or three years.” (Aaron Blake has more.)

The congressman apologized in a trio of late-night tweets:

I apologize for my failure to immediately condemn anyone who would say something as outrageous as they like raping women. (1/3) — Blake Farenthold (@farenthold) October 12, 2016

During an interview on MSNBC with Chris Hayes tonight, I was thrown off by the anchor’s use of a hypothetical question. (2/3) — Blake Farenthold (@farenthold) October 12, 2016

I do not, and have not ever condoned rape or violence against women. That is not the kind of man I believe Donald Trump to be. (3/3) — Blake Farenthold (@farenthold) October 12, 2016

-- Farenthold’s stumble raises the question of how high Trump’s floor of support might be. It is doubtlessly higher than conventional wisdom in the mainstream media would suggest.

A comprehensive USA Today survey finds that 26 percent of Republican governors, senators and House members are now refusing to endorse Trump. In real numbers, that is 88 out of 331. Put another way, three-quarters of elected GOP leaders are supporting The Donald.

In New Hampshire, for example, Sen. Kelly Ayotte is the only statewide Republican to withdraw her support for Trump. The Concord Monitor notes that the Republican gubernatorial nominee and both GOP congressional candidates condemned Trump’s comments but continue to support him.

-- In next door Maine, Gov. Paul LePage (R) actually said yesterday that “authoritarian power” may be needed in the United States. “Sometimes, I wonder that our Constitution is not only broken, but we need … [Trump] to show some authoritarian power in our country and bring back the rule of law,” his longtime supporter said during a radio interview. “We’ve had eight years of a president, he’s an autocrat, he just does it on his own, he ignores Congress and every single day, we’re slipping into anarchy.” (Portland Press-Herald)

-- Other Republicans who clearly do not like Trump personally are nonetheless continuing to support him for political reasons:

People close to Ted Cruz said after the convention in Cleveland that the Texas senator would not endorse Trump because he saw his former rival as an authoritarian in the mold of Benito Mussolini. Now Cruz is sticking with someone who he sees as a strongman — and who has also suggested that his father was somehow involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy and who has criticized his wife’s physical appearance.

Marco Rubio, after staying under the radar for a few days, announced yesterday that he is standing by Trump despite the video (and his insistence earlier this year that the reality TV star cannot be trusted with nuclear weapons). “I wish we had better choices for President,” the Florida senator (whom Trump not-so-affectionately dubbed “Little Marco”) said in a statement. “But I do not want Hillary Clinton to be our next President. And therefore my position has not changed.” (Miami Herald)

-- History will not be kind to these Trump collaborators in the GOP establishment, conservative thought leader Ross Douthat argues in an important column for today’s New York Times: “In bending the knee to Trump last spring, they thought that they were buying party unity and a continued share of power, and paying for it with just a little of their decency, a mite of their patriotism, a soupçon of their honor. They may find out soon enough that all this bargain bought them was an even harsher reckoning, and that all they will inherit is the wind. … History in its day to day is not a morality play. But sometimes there is a clear chastisement, a moment when the judgments of providence seem stark. And so it may be for the men who led the Republican Party into its Trumpian inferno.”

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:

John Podesta tells reporters he believes Trump's campaign "had advanced warning" before WikiLeaks published his emails.

-- Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said the FBI is actively investigating the hack of his private email account, blaming the cyberattack on Russia and suggesting that Trump’s campaign may have had advanced warning. From John Wagner and Anne Gearan: "I've been involved in politics for nearly five decades, and this definitely is the first campaign that I've been involved with in which I've had to tangle with Russian intelligence agencies, who seem to be doing everything they can on behalf of our opponent," Podesta told reporters aboard Clinton’s plane. He said it would be "reasonable" to assume that the Trump campaign knew his email was going to be released by WikiLeaks, pointing to comments made earlier this year between longtime Trump ally Roger Stone and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange: “Around the same time, Stone pointed his finger at me, and said that I could expect some treatment that would expose me," Podesta said, referring to comments on Twitter in August by Stone, who said it would soon be "Podesta's time in the barrel."

THE BATTLEGROUNDS:

-- VIRGINIA: The University of Virginia’s College Republicans chapter voted to rescind its Trump endorsement. A number of other College Republican affiliates have also backed away, agreeing to write in candidates or vote their "conscience." The move came a day after Trump’s campaign fired its Virginia state co-chairman, Corey Stewart, for taking part in a protest in front of Republican National Committee headquarters. (T. Rees Shapiro)

-- UTAH: A survey by Y2 Analytics in today’s Deseret News finds that Trump has slipped into a dead heat with Clinton in the deeply red state. The two are tied, with 26 percent each. BYU graduate Evan McMullin is currently drawing 22 percent, and Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson is at 14 percent.

-- Clinton has concluded that the traditionally red states of GEORGIA and ARIZONA are now realistic targets to win in November as Trump's campaign continues to flounder, Alex Burns and Jonathan Martin report in the New York Times. “Increasingly anxious Republicans have not come up with a unified strategy for containing the damage from Mr. Trump’s embattled candidacy.… But, in a sign that Republicans now view the presidential race as a lost cause, several Senate candidates are preparing ads asking voters to elect them as a check on Mrs. Clinton in the White House.” (Internal GOP polling conducted in the wake of the video has also found that Trump in in a perilous position in Georgia.)

-- FLORIDA: Former vice president Al Gore campaigned with Hillary Clinton in Miami, seeking to shore up support for the Democratic nominee among millennial voters as he also urged action to combat climate change. “Appearing clean shaven and considerably grayer than during his years in office, Gore sounded professorial as he talked about atmospheric changes, and he came across as a little rusty on the political stump,” John Wagner reports. Meanwhile, Clinton praised Gore as “one of the world’s most foremost leaders” on the issue, telling the audience that she would seek his advice on such issues upon entering the Oval Office next year.

-- NORTH CAROLINA: President Obama stumped for her in Greensboro, eviscerating Trump as “unfit for the presidency." From David Nakamura: “Obama seemed to revel in his ridicule of the Republican nominee, mocking Trump for his loss of nearly $1 billion, his refusal to release his tax returns and his lewd comments about women. 'The guy says stuff nobody would find tolerable if they were applying for a job at 7-Eleven,' Obama said, delivering remarks to a crowd of 7,700. 'I also know a lot of casino operators who managed not to lose $1 billion in a year. They say the house always wins. I don’t know what happened.'"

-- More than half a million Americans have now voted, according to a running tally being kept by the University of Florida’s Michael McDonald. That’s a small percentage of the 130 million or more votes that analysts expect. But the number is about to begin increasing exponentially. Early voting begins today in Ohio, for example.

TRUMP'S PROBLEM WITH WOMEN KEEPS GETTING WORSE:

-- Four women who competed in the 1997 Miss TEEN USA beauty pageant said Trump walked into the dressing room while contestants — some as young as 15 — were changing. From BuzzFeed: “I remember putting on my dress really quick because I was like, ‘Oh my God, there’s a man in here,’’ said Mariah Billado, the former Miss Vermont Teen USA. Trump, she recalled, said something like, ‘Don’t worry ladies, I’ve seen it all before.’ Three other contestants also remembered Trump entering the dressing room while girls were changing, saying the girls tried to cover their bodies, with one calling it ‘shocking’ and ‘creepy.’”

-- Former Miss Arizona Tasha Dixon corroborated the reports: “He just came strolling right in. There was no second to put a robe on or any sort of clothing or anything,” the 2001 winner told CBS Los Angeles. “Some girls were topless. Others girls were naked. Our first introduction to him was when we were at the dress rehearsal and half naked changing into our bikinis. To have the owner come waltzing in, when we’re naked, or half naked, in a very physically vulnerable position and then to have the pressure of the people that worked for him telling us to go fawn all over him, go walk up to him, talk to him, get his attention.” (Fred Barbash)

-- These women are coming forward after it emerged that Trump bragged about strolling through dressing rooms while contestants were changing during a 2005 interview with Howard Stern. “I’ll tell you the funniest is that I’ll go backstage before a show and everyone’s getting dressed,” Trump said. “… I’m allowed to go in, because I’m the owner of the pageant and therefore I’m inspecting it…. ‘Is everyone okay’? You know, they’re standing there with no clothes. ‘Is everybody okay?’ And you see these incredible looking women, and so I sort of get away with things like that.”

-- A former Trump Tower executive who spent two decades working for Trump called him "A SUPREME SEXIST" who thinks “men are better than women”: “He told me, and he believed this, that women had to work harder and be smarter and were willing to work harder than men," Barbara Res told the Daily Beast’s Olivia Nuzzi in an interview. She also said the real estate developer blamed his early ‘90s business failures on being a so-called “women magnet,” blaming poor work done by executives while he was off hooking up with women “two and three at a time.” “Res explained that as Trump’s fame grew, his ability to withstand criticism — or even honesty — shrank. ‘He got too famous. He started believing his own [expletive],’ she said. ‘He got way too famous and, you know, people were telling him he was great and he was buying that. He started thinking that he walked on water, he really did.’”

-- Related: A sound engineer responsible for attaching Trump’s microphone on “The Apprentice” said that Donald repeatedly referred to him as a “[expletive] monkey” and described his experience working with him the “most abusive, humiliating experience” of his career. From BuzzFeed: “The engineer said the first time he was assigned to put a mic on Trump, the real estate mogul refused to shake his hand, instead turning to one of his many assistants and saying, ‘’Whoa, whoa, whoa, who’s this [effing] monkey?’ … He said throughout all of their interactions, Trump refused to address him directly, instead aiming all of his comments about the engineer to his assistants. ‘I’m not gonna let this [effing] monkey touch me unless he washes his hands,’ Trump reportedly said, making one of his assistants escort the engineer to the bathroom and watch him wash his hands, before walking him back and reporting to Trump. ‘He treated me like I wasn’t a human being,’ the engineer said. ‘I’ve mic’d everyone from Ben Affleck to Renée Zellweger, and never, ever in my career have I run into something like that.’”

-- Eric Trump chalked up his father’s predatory remarks to an example of “TWO ALPHA DOGS" caught mid-conversation: “It was two alpha guys in a thing, and by the way, it is totally unacceptable,” the younger Trump said in a radio interview. “He acknowledged that, and he apologized for it. It's two guys by themselves in private at some event going back and forth. My father is a man that has a heart of gold.” (CNN)

-- The worst surrogate award may go to Ben Carson, who suggested the problem with Trump’s so-called “locker room” comments is that not enough people have been exposed to that type of sexually aggressive language. “Maybe that’s the problem,” he told a stunned Brianna Keilar on CNN. (At a Missouri religious liberty forum, meanwhile, Carson gravely warned that tyranny and “mass killings” were the end result of “the whole gay marriage issue.”)

-- Billy Bush is negotiating his exit with NBC News, permanently leaving the "Today" show. From The Hollywood Reporter: Initial plans to let him apologize on the "Today" show this week were scuttled after the show’s female staff expressed outrage that he would not suffer any consequences. Prominent Hollywood publicists also promised to keep their clients away from the show if Bush was to return to his slot. Another said Bush’s reputation preceded him: “At Access, he was always ‘that guy.’ There were people who were anxious about him before he started [on Today]."

TRUMP GOES FULL BULWORTH:

-- Trump declared war on the Republican establishment, lashing out at Paul Ryan, John McCain and other GOP elected officials as the extraordinary turbulence within the GOP reached a boiling point. (Sean Sullivan)

-- In an interview on "The O'Reilly Factor” last night, he said he no longer wants Ryan’s support while speculating on air about the speaker's political future. When asked if he thinks establishment Republicans, including Ryan, will support him as president if he’s elected, Trump said yes, adding: “They’ll be there. I would think that Ryan maybe wouldn’t be there; maybe he’ll be in a different position."

-- The campaign launched a television ad questioning about Clinton’s health and stamina. The ad, titled “Dangerous,” shows footage of the Democratic nominee coughing, needing assistance up steps, and nearly fainting outside a 9/11 memorial — all filmed during her well-documented September bout with pneumonia — while a narrator says she does not have "the fortitude, strength or stamina” to lead. It is “Trump at his Trumpiest,” Chris Cillizza writes. “Trump’s supporter base will absolutely LOVE this commercial. The problem is that there aren't nearly enough people in Trump's base to win him the election." (Click above to watch.)

-- Trump campaign CEO and Breitbart News chairman Steve Bannon bragged that he was Trump’s “campaign manager” a year before signing on with the team, touting his influence in an email to former Hollywood writing partner Julia Jones. From the Daily Beast’s Asawin Suebsaeng: “I'm Trump's campaign manager,” Bannon told Jones in a 2015 email. “OMG! Is that confidential or can I tweet it :)),” Jones replied later that day. “I am soooo impressed. Really! He couldn't have picked a better person. OMG!” “Confidential,” Bannon responded. “Don't u ever read breitbart--its trump central.”

-- Meanwhile, Bannon also had a goal of “destroying” Paul Ryan’s newly minted success, according to The Hill’s Jonathan Swan: “On editorial conference calls, the Breitbart chairman would often say ‘Paul Ryan is the enemy,’ according to a source who worked with Bannon...." In December 2015, weeks after Ryan became speaker, Bannon wrote in an internal Breitbart email that the “long game” for his site was for Ryan to be “gone” by spring. In a Dec. 1 email, Breitbart Washington editor Matt Boyle suggested to Bannon that a story promoting Ryan’s planned overhaul of the mental health system would be a good way to “open a bridge” to Ryan. Bannon wasn’t keen on the idea. "'I’ve got a cure for mental health issue,’ Bannon wrote to Boyle. ‘Spank your children more.’”

-- ON HIS OWN "ESSENTIAL LONELINESS": “Politics is an effort to make human connection, but Trump seems incapable of that,” New York Times' David Brooks writes. “[His] emotional makeup means he can hit only a few notes: fury and aggression. In some ways, his debate performances look like primate dominance displays — filled with chest beating and looming growls. But at least primates have bands to connect with, whereas Trump is so alone, if a tree fell in his emotional forest, it would not make a sound. … None of us would want to live in the howling wilderness of his own solitude, no matter how thick the gilding. On Nov. 9, the day after Trump loses, there won’t be solidarity and howls of outrage. Everyone will just walk away.”

Ben Sasse back home in Nebraska (Benjamin Terris/The Washington Post)

THE FUTURE OF THE GOP?

-- Nebraska freshman Sen. Ben Sasse, who courageously refused to endorse Trump when it was politically risky, is coming out with a book next May to raise his national profile. His publisher, St. Martins, says it is about "our coming of age crisis and how to rebuild a culture of self-reliance.” The book is titled "The Vanishing American Adult" and reflects on Sasse’s time as the president of Midland University for five years before he got elected in 2014. "Our kids aren't growing up because we're no longer showing them how," Sasse writes, adding that he was "surprised and troubled by his students' passivity: their seeming inability to take initiative and solve problems without adult help.” (Lincoln Journal-Star)

"Sasse casts his approach to politics, education, theology, and life in sweeping historical terms. A typical 30-minute speech covers 6,000 years, indulges in a smattering of McKinseyan jabberwocky, and cites C.S. Lewis, Thomas Friedman, and Alexis de Tocqueville," Tim Murphy writes in a flattering profile for Mother Jones. "But the basic thrust is that the institutions that have steadied America's progress over the last 200 years are no longer up to the task. Sasse likes to talk about the cratering effect that sites like Expedia had on traditional travel agencies, a cautionary tale of the power of disintermediation to usurp established systems: 'Adapt or die’ … As a longtime scholar of the Protestant Reformation and a self-described ‘crisis turnaround guy,’ Sasse has spent his life studying what happens when major organizations become unmoored from their mission. The Republican Party may be his biggest project yet.”

THE DAILY HILLARY:

-- Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said in a May 2015 email that a DOJ official had informed him about Clinton’s status in a civil case over her private email server — a leak on which Trump immediately pounced this week. But not too fast, says The Post’s Matt Zapotosky — the exchange might not be as bad as Trump’s campaign is making it out to be. The date of the status hearing was listed on the court’s public docket, and though someone seemed to alert Fallon to a filing in the docket, it would also presumably be public record.

-- Clinton announced she will propose expanding a tax credit for parents with young children, a move her campaign is billing as a “middle-class tax cut,” and which appears to ensure that the Democratic presidential nominee will not propose any across-the-board reductions in income tax rates before November 8. From Jim Tankersley: “Clinton's announcement, which appears to be one of the final additions to her policy platform, will put hard numbers on her earlier promise to expand the Child Tax Credit. It would double the maximum value of that credit, from $1,000 per child to $2,000 per child up to age 4. It would allow millions more low-income families to claim that credit, her campaign said, by tweaking an income threshold and allowing the refundable credit to be claimed for the first $3,000 that a worker earns. For working families, Clinton said.… ‘This new tax credit will make their lives a little bit easier.’” The announcement comes as Clinton seeks to help working families with young children defray rising living costs, including making pre-K education universally available and offering tax credits for out-of-pocket health-care costs.

WAPO HIGHLIGHT:

-- “‘Everything … had sexual connotations’: Being young, female and a reporter in the 1960s,” by Debra Bruno: “In her long career, Connie Lawn has had a knack for showing up at memorable moments in history. The veteran independent broadcast journalist conducted one of the last interviews with Robert Kennedy before he was assassinated. She arrived in Czechoslovakia in 1968 two weeks after Soviet tanks rolled in to crush the Prague Spring. In 1972, she was living in a Watergate apartment at the time of the infamous break-in at Democratic headquarters ... From the start, her life has been a combination of intrepid adventures and screwball situations that seem perfect for a screenplay about the redhead who challenged presidents, argued her way past the Secret Service and shouted her breaking news reports into the nearest landline available.” But as a longtime female journalist, she has also confronted less-desirable acts of sexual harassment, including reportedly getting propositioned for a sexual favor by Roger Ailes when she interviewed for a job, and being forced to wear wigs and short dresses while serving as a weather girl. (She knew nothing about meteorology and occasionally made up forecasts in rebellion.) Now, in the final stages of Parkinson’s disease, is looking back with pride and nostalgia on her decades-long, roller-coaster career.”

Others try to rebuke his comments, yet STILL choose to vote for a sexual predator - because let’s be honest, that’s what he is. 9/ — Marybeth (@MBGlenn) October 11, 2016

"What he said is wrong, and the way he treats women is wrong, but it’s not wrong enough for me to not vote for him." Thanks, cowards. 10/ — Marybeth (@MBGlenn) October 11, 2016

Various men in the movement are writing it off as normal, confirming every stereotype the left has thrown at them. So I'm done. 11/ — Marybeth (@MBGlenn) October 11, 2016

HOT ON THE LEFT: “ACLU finds social media sites gave data to company tracking black protesters,” from The Guardian: “Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have previously provided users’ data to a software company that aids police surveillance programs and targets protesters of color, according to government records obtained by the [ACLU]. The ACLU revealed on Tuesday that the technology corporations gave ‘special access’ to Geofeedia, a controversial social media monitoring company that partners with law enforcement and has marketed its services as a tool to track Black Lives Matter activists. ‘The fact that third parties are making big money off of the sale and trading of our data with law enforcement is a huge problem and one that any social media user in this country or beyond should be disgusted and surprised by,’” said Center for Media Justice director Malkia Cyril. HOT ON THE RIGHT: “UT investigating sexual harassment claim after student gets zero on quiz,” from the Knoxville News-Sentinel: “University of Tennessee officials are investigating a claim of sexual harassment after reports surfaced online that a student received a zero on a geology quiz for answering a question about his lab instructor's name with that of a semifamous lingerie model.” The student was apparently given a zero on a quiz for his answer to the question, “‘What is your lab instructor's name? (If you don't remember make something good up.)’ ‘… I literally put down a very common girl name and a common last name, Sarah Jackson,’ he said. ‘Turns out Sarah Jackson is a porn star so I got a 0 ... I didn't know that was the case and (had) zero intention of trying to be funny or rude."

GOOD READ FROM ELSEWHERE:

-- Vanity Fair’s Sarah Ellison reports that Fox News is “ready to pull out the red carpet for Megyn Kelly,” with James and Lachlan Murdoch playing a pivotal role to keep her at the network: “Since the Ailes scandal broke … the younger Murdochs have become more involved in the network. Not only did the brothers unilaterally decide to retain the law firm … whose internal investigation facilitated Ailes’s exit, but they are now playing a pivotal role in persuading the network’s brightest star, Megyn Kelly, whose contract expires in July 2017, to re-sign. ’James loves Megyn,’ [a source said]. ‘He believes she’s a big part of the future of this channel.’ According to a person close to Kelly, she has dined at the younger Murdoch’s homes twice in the past several months. This person close to Kelly explained that the younger Murdochs appear to be doing everything in their power to keep the anchor …”

QUOTE OF THE DAY: “It is not acceptable to ask a moral, dignified man to cast his vote to help elect an immoral man who is absent decency or dignity,” Glenn Beck posted on Facebook. “If the consequence of standing against Trump and for principles is indeed the election of Hillary Clinton, so be it. At least it is a moral, ethical choice. If she is elected, the world does not end....”
