Glenn's officially gone insane; the dude has finally stepped over the edge.



To: ThinkingBuddha

Posting this is making fun of a mentally ill person; shame on you.

Cheer up, Glenn.

To: ThinkingBuddha

Glenn has been given over to a debased mindset.



To: ThinkingBuddha

Go and rub your compass, Glenn.

Beck is suffering from delusions. He is nuts!



To: ThinkingBuddha

Does he miss not having been on Air America when it was still around, or something?



To: ThinkingBuddha

Somebody take away Beck’s belts and shoelaces before he hurts himself.

To: ThinkingBuddha

Like many in the “right”, a Trump loss is his only chance for relevancy.



To: ThinkingBuddha

Maybe Megyn Kelly can join up with him after Nov 8th.



To: Olog-hai

Maybe poor Glenn thinks Mrs. Bill will let him swear her in, they way he did for TCruz.

Holy cow. I never thought I’d see the day.



To: ThinkingBuddha

I can understand a conservative who registers as a Republican, who not liking either candidate, votes 3rd party. I can not understand a republican who votes for Clinton.



To: ThinkingBuddha

Glenn is an alcoholic. I guarantee there are some things in his past he never wants disclosed. To stay sober he had to “admit to God, to himself and to another (one) person the exact nature of his wrongs.” That means he has to be honest to himself. But that doesn’t mean lots of others don’t know and that a good PI can certainly did it up. As with all the others who turn on a dime, they’re being black mailed. Allowing himself to be blackmailed into lying is another thing that will cause him to twist off. Don’t be surprised if he doesn’t show up drunk in the near future. Or worse.

To: ThinkingBuddha

He’s finally gone completely unhinged.



To: Theodore R.

To go from Cruz to Hillary on the issue of morality proves he’s being blackmailed. We’ve always known he’s just plain nuts. He’s got severe brain damage from his drinking days.

The prophet Beck anointed Ted Cruz, but we unworthy people rejected him. So now the prophet calls down the whirlwind upon us!



To: ThinkingBuddha

Hillary. Moral. Two words that one would not find next to each other.

Mao Tse Tung was a moral and ethical choice for Tibetans! Nero was a moral and ethical choice for Roman Christians and real estate owners! WTF?

I wonder if he is getting paid. I know he is a sleaze in that he takes money from advertizers that I would never recommend.



To: Preston Manning

“Somebody take away Becks belts and shoelaces before he hurts himself.” And that would be a bad thing why?



To: ThinkingBuddha

Whatever little respect I still held for this man, and it was infinitesimal, has evaporated completely never to be restored.



To: dragonblustar

Beck is going Full Mormon here. No way it helps his career other than that.

To: ThinkingBuddha

I doubt Mormons believe in abortion.

why hasn’t the Mormon church excommunicated him?



by 27 posted onby RadiationRomeo (Step into my mind and glimpse the madness that is me)

To: ThinkingBuddha

Does he have advertisers? I am just curious who still supports him. And he has sure taught me never to trust a Mormon. Beck, Romney, Flake, Mia Love, etc.... All backstabbers of the cult.

Mormons have their own mafia. Who knew?



To: ThinkingBuddha

I called WRVA this morning to ask that they remove this jerk from their morning spot and replace him with someone who is not insane.

Yeah, he said the same thing about Cruz.

To: ThinkingBuddha

Idiot Beck is simply seeking attention. He hates becoming irrelevant. So, he has resorted to making attention grabbing statements. Best to ignore him. Do not give him attention by posting threads.

To: ThinkingBuddha

Despite his rhetoric over the past several years, Glenn Beck has exposed himself as one of the bad guys he’s lambasted.



To: MUDDOG

Anointing a politician is disgusting. Might as well do voodoo over a cow chip.

Just like the Amish, which actually the Amish mafia really does surprise me.



To: ThinkingBuddha

I guess if you consider disaster capitalism moral



To: ThinkingBuddha

Several Freepers have stated that they think Beck is being blackmailed. Alex Jones stated on his radio program a couple of months ago that the Dims have photos of Beck of a sexual nature and are using these photos to blackmail Beck. Its Alex Jones so take it for what its worth. I know some Freepers don’t like Jones and will discount his opinions but something weird is going on with Beck.



To: ThinkingBuddha



Makes me glad TheBlaze is going belly-up

To: DesertRhino

voodoo over a cow chip. LOL! The anointing of Obama.

The Mormons believe in open borders, that’s what there opposition to Trump is really all about.

To: Terry Mross

Yeah, something is definitely off. From Cruz to Hillary is a bridge far too far. Cruz is still supporting Trump, btw.

And now the democrats using his words to help Hillary.

To: ThinkingBuddha

After the few years I watched him and now seeing him say this................I wonder how much money Soros gave him? Or what do they have on him? He was a doper and a drinker back in the day.

To: ThinkingBuddha

So, Medved and now Beck. Man, they continue to lift the veil.

To: ThinkingBuddha

Anyone that was still on the Glenn Beck train within the last few years was clueless. I am not sure they’ll get it now either.



To: ThinkingBuddha

I suspect that he has been promised a big payoff for attacking Trump and now actually supporting Hillary. His “empire” is in trouble, he needs cash, his base is gone, so where does he get it? Hillary donors.



To: MUDDOG

That pretty much sums it up. Wow.
