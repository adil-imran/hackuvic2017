MH17 missile 'came from Russia', Dutch-led investigators say

bbc.com ^ | 28 September 2016 | BBC

Posted on by Berlin_Freeper

International prosecutors say Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was downed over eastern Ukraine in 2014 by a Buk missile that had come from Russia.

They also narrowed down the area it was fired from to a field in territory controlled by Russian-backed rebels.

All 298 people on board the Boeing 777 died when it broke apart in mid-air flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.

Vladimir Putin is responsible for the mass homicide of 298 men, women and children blown to pieces out of God's beautiful blue sky. He should do the Christian thing, admit his guilt, seek forgiveness and make generous payments to the families of his victims.

The rebels clearly thought that they shot down Ukrainian troop transport. As such, they did not commit a war crime nor did Russia in supplying the weapons because the weapons where aimed at legitimate targets of war. They could be guilty of negligence but then again so could the Ukrainian government who routed planes over the middle of a war zone instead of through the safe area's of the Black sea. Ultimately I think the Ukrainian government was hoping to get a civilian plane shot down to negate the rebels AA weapons and to gain support in the west. There simply was no other reason to route commercial traffic over the area. And yes Russia and the Ukraine should both pay restitution to the innocent victims.

On 10 April 2010, a Tupolev Tu-154 aircraft of the Polish Air Force crashed near the city of Smolensk, Russia, killing all 96 people on board. Among the victims were the President of Poland Lech Kaczynski and his wife Maria, the former President of Poland in exile Ryszard Kaczorowski, the chief of the Polish General Staff and other senior Polish military officers, the president of the National Bank of Poland, Polish Government officials, 18 members of the Polish Parliament, senior members of the Polish clergy and relatives of victims of the Katyn massacre. The group was arriving from Warsaw to attend an event marking the 70th anniversary of the [Katyn] massacre, which took place not far from Smolensk." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Polish_Air_Force_Tu-154_crash ********************************************************** April 2014... Did Putin Blow Up the Whole Polish Government in 2010?

A Second Look A plane crash at Smolensk in Russia four years ago wiped out the Warsaw leadership. It used to be seen as an accident. Now, after Putin's games in Ukraine, people aren't so sure. Four years ago this week, Polish President Lech Kaczynski was killed in a plane crash near the Katyn Forest in Russia where he was flying to honor the 22,000 Polish officers, lawyers, priests and professors slaughtered there by the Soviets 70 years before. Ninety-five other military, political and public figures including his wife died on that plane. One of the more heartbreaking details to emerge was that First Lady Maria Kaczynska's body could be identified only by her nail polish and the inscription inside her wedding ring. Less than two years before the crash the late president had given a speech warning that if Russian aggression was not stopped in Georgia, which Russia had invaded, it would extend to Ukraine, the Baltics, and possibly Poland as well. "We are here to take up the fight," he said. And many Poles still believe that their president died in the cause of that effort. Physicist Kazimierz Nowaczyk is one of them. ..."

http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/11/did-putin-blow-up-the-whole-polish-government-in-2010-a-second-look.html ******************************************************************* Note: They are no longer the "opposition". They won the October 2011 election. Opposition publishes 'alternative' Smolensk report PR dla Zagranicy Law and Justice (PiS), led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the twin brother of the late President Lech Kaczynski, has presented the first part of the so-called White Book report on the Smolensk tragedy of 10 April last year, days before the release of the official government version. Law and Justice has been highly critical of both the Russian and Polish investigations into the tragedy which killed 96 politicians and top military brass, among others. Shortly after the air crash in western Russia, the opposition party, closely associated with the late President Kaczynski, set up its own parliamentary committee headed by MP Antoni Macierewicz. The report represents the conclusions of the committee. The White Book on Smolensk comprises 20 chapters and contains over 100 additional documents gathered and compiled by the team of Law and Justice MP investigators. The first part of the report released today deals with alleged shortcomings of the Russian Interstate Aviation Committee's (MAK) report released last year, though all of the criticisms have been made before by Law and Justice. The second part of the document will be issued tomorrow and will detail criticisms of the Polish government's investigation, the report of which is currently being translated into English and Russian and will be released shortly, possibly on Friday. One of the conclusions of the first part of the Law and Justice report is that Russian protocol envisaged only the attendance of Prime Minister Donald Tusk at the 70th anniversary commemorations of the 1940 Katyn Massacre. Because of this, says the report, President Kaczynski's arrival three days later in western Russia had been given the status of a private and not official state visit. This had the consequence of downgrading security arrangements for the party led by Lech Kaczynski, says the report. "The decision had been taken by the Russian side but it was approved by representatives of Mr. Tusk's government," MP Antoni Macierewicz said today as he launched the report. "Nevertheless, the decision itself had been in Russian hands. Polish diplomats were informed openly that only Prime Minister Tusk will be guaranteed security, while the President's visit remains of no interest to the Russian side," he said. Antoni Macierewicz also stressed that the doomed presidential Tupolev 154 had undergone a general overhaul barely a year before the crash at the Aviakor plant in Russian Samara. Law and Justice reject the conclusions of the Russian report, which blamed pilot error for the crash. Antoni Macierewicz emphasises that air traffic control at the Smolensk airport did not give clear guidance to the pilots as they approached landing. http://www.thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/46756,Opposition-publishes-%E2%80%98alternative%E2%80%99-Smolensk-report

Russia 'to revive the KGB' after Putin wins biggest majority Telegraph (UK) ^ | 19 September 2016  3:39PM | Marc Bennetts Russia plans effectively to revive the KGB under a massive shake-up of its security forces, a respected business daily has reported. A State Security Ministry, or MGB, would be created from the current Federal Security Service (FSB) , and would incorporate the foreign intelligence service (SVR) and the state guard service (FSO), under the plans. It would be handed all-encompassing powers once possessed by the KGB, the Kommersant newspaper said, citing security service sources. Like the much-feared KGB, it would also oversee the prosecutions of Kremlin critics, a task currently undertaken by the Investigative Committee, headed by Alexander Bastrykin, a former university classmate of President Putin. The Kremlin has not commented.

There's a few anti-russian Soros paid copy and paste shills around here. It was the Soros-supported Obama administration that set Putin up on missile defense and nuke deals, including the Iran nuke deal, you mindless dope. They all basically share the same goals. Each wants a substantially weaker US. And not only did the Soros-supported Obama admin help build up Russia's strength, he slashed our defenses! Your guy Putin couldn't hope for a better friend/comrade in the WH than Obama. Now see if you can read and understand the following this time. (as if it would matter anyway, Putinista POS that you are) From Real Clear Politics, Sept 10, 2015... "In a 2014 New Yorker interview, Obama said his goal was to create a 'new equilibrium' in the Middle East. In the short run, at least, his signature diplomatic undertaking can be counted on to bring more violence to this volatile region. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as the [Obama-Putin Iran deal] agreement is formally known, provides the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism an infusion of somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 billion of unfrozen assets and a great deal more of continuing revenues as businesses and governments around the world rush to profit from oil-and-gas-rich Iran's reintegration into the world economy. The agreement relaxes the international isolation of the Islamic Republic and ratifies Tehran's status as a nuclear threshold state. And it relieves restrictions on Iran's acquisition of weapons, including ballistic missiles. ..." http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/09/10/iran_deal_throws_sparks_on_mideast_tinderbox_128034.html

That’s why there’s no point to banning them. They have multiple accounts (it’s fun to watch the newbs show up), or they simply re-register. As if they are internet locusts. And it’s even funnier to watch them when their talking-points break down, and they choose to tough it out. Sometimes, the Kremlin changes the talking points on the fly, and they are left twisting in the wind. Life is not fair that way, especially when you are stuck in a Soviet-era apartment, and need the rubles.

____________________________ Russian Propaganda Is Taking Over Online Comment Boards Pamela Engel

May 4, 2014 British newspaper The Guardian notes that recently, readers have been complaining of pro-Russia propaganda being posted in the comments section of articles about Russia and Ukraine. One reader wrote to The Guardian: "One need only pick a Ukraine article at random, pick any point in the comments at random, and they will find themselves in a sea of incredibly aggressive and hostile users (the most obvious have accounts created since February 2014 ... but there also exist those who registered with the Guardian before the high point of the crisis) who post the most biased, inciteful [sic] pro-Kremlin, anti-western propaganda that seems as if it's taken from a template, so repetitive are the statements. Furthermore, these comments are consistently capturing inordinate numbers of 'recommends', sometimes on the order of 10 to 12 times what pro-Ukrainian comments receive." Guardian comment moderators believe this is an orchestrated campaign. Russia has worked hard to make people believe that the country is supporting the Russian-speaking population in Ukraine and defending those people against some type of threat. These "comment mills" play into that strategy. Last year, The Atlantic wrote about how the Russian government apparently pays people to "sit in a room, surf the Internet, and leave sometimes hundreds of postings a day that criticize the country's opposition and promote Kremlin-backed policymakers." This practice isn't new, according to The Atlantic. But it can stifle open discussion about political issues in Russia, giving a louder voice to those who support the Kremlin. http://www.businessinsider.com/putin-paying-people-to-post-pro-russia-propaganda-in-comments-2014-5

Vladimir Putin has been strengthening military links here, and Russia is now the largest arms dealer to governments in Latin America, surpassing the United States. Russia has even floated the possibility of building new military bases in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, and putting its warships permanently in the Caribbean.

Romanian intelligence defector Ion Mihai Pacepa alleged that an operation for the removal of chemical weapons was prepared by the Soviet Union for Libya, and that he was told over thirty years ago by Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu, KGB chairman Yury Andropov, and later, Yevgeny Primakov, about the existence of a similar plan for Iraq. It is 'perfectly obvious', wrote Pacepa, that the Russian GRU agency helped Saddam Hussein to destroy, hide, or transfer his chemical weapons prior to the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. 'After all, Russia helped Saddam get his hands on them in the first place.'[13] John Loftus, director of The Intelligence Summit, said in the November 16, 2007 issue of FrontPage Magazine that many documents from Iraq point to WMD being transferred to other countries such as Syria: 'As stated in more detail in my full report, the British, Ukrainian and American secret services all believed that the Russians had organized a last minute evacuation of CW [chemical] and BW [biological] stockpiles from Baghdad to Syria.' His researchers allegedly found a document ordering the concealment of nuclear weapons equipment in storage facilities under the Euphrates River a few weeks before the invasion.[14]" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMD_conjecture_in_the_aftermath_of_the_2003_invasion_of_Iraq#Alleged_Russian_involvement

UN is an evil organization. Russia should be held accountable, but I dont think anyone here wants to see UN have any relevancy. Formation of the United Nations: " Alger Hiss (November 11, 1904 - November 15, 1996) was an American lawyer, government official, author, and lecturer. He was involved in the establishment of the United Nations both as a U.S. State Department and U.N. official. Hiss was accused of being a Soviet spy in 1948 and convicted of perjury in connection with this charge in 1950. (November 11, 1904 - November 15, 1996) was an American lawyer, government official, author, and lecturer. On August 3, 1948, Whittaker Chambers, a former Communist Party member, testified under subpoena before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) that Hiss had secretly been a Communist while in federal service. Chambers had previously testified under oath that Hiss had never been a Communist or a spy, and Chambers would admit, under oath, to other instances where he had committed perjury under oath. Called before HUAC, Hiss categorically denied the charge. When Chambers repeated his claim on nationwide radio, Hiss filed a defamation lawsuit against him. During the pretrial discovery process, Chambers produced new evidence indicating that he and Hiss had been involved in espionage, which both men had previously denied under oath to HUAC. A federal grand jury indicted Hiss on two counts of perjury; Chambers admitted to the same offense but, as a cooperating government witness, was never charged. Although Hiss's indictment stemmed from the alleged espionage, he could not be tried for that crime because the statute of limitations had expired." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiss_Case

" Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was downed over eastern Ukraine in 2014 by a Buk missile that had come from Russia"



To: Berlin_Freeper

The airline needs to share the blame. They flew right over an active battle area where AA missiles were routinely being fired. If any airliner flew over Aleppo, Syria today, and was shot down, they would have to share the blame. Ditto this case.



To: Berlin_Freeper

Question: is this a civilian passenger plane or a military aircraft? What do you think it looks like ten miles out, on radar, over a battlefield? Answer: it's a brand new US Navy Poseidon P-8 reconnaissance aircraft, a military 737. Then I do recall the USN Vincennes blowing an Iranian passenger jet out of the sky over international waters. The point being, any airline that flies a jet over an active modern battlefield (Ukraine, Syria etc) must share the blame if it is shot down by a radar-directed missile.
