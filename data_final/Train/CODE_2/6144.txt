Following his appointment as British Foreign Secretary British politician Boris Johnson has without explanation transformed from a supporter of cooperation with Bashar Al-Assad, the Syrian government and Russia in the fight against Jihadi terrorism into a supporter alongside Saudi Arabia of regime change in Syria.

Russia is "guilty of protracting" the war in Syria and of "making it far more hideous".



He also said he was "pretty convinced" that Russia was behind the attack on a UN aid convoy near the Syrian northern city of Aleppo. Russian President Vladimir Putin was "not only... handing [Syrian President Bashar] Assad the revolver. He is in some instances actually firing the revolver himself," Johnson said.



"We should be looking at whether or not that targeting is done in the knowledge that those are wholly innocent civilian targets. That is a war crime," he added.

"Everything is correct, except for two words: the word 'Russia' should be replaced with 'Britain,' and 'Syria' with 'Iraq.'"

Currently Syria is seeing intensified fighting in the city of Aleppo, after the Syrian army declared an end to the week-long ceasefire on Friday, blaming militants for numerous violations that made the cessation of hostilities unreasonable.



Earlier on Sunday, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that Aleppo had faced the most intense airstrikes since the start of the Syrian conflict, expressing dismay at the situation and the fate of civilians trapped in the city.



A UN-Syrian Arab Red Crescent convoy carrying humanitarian aid for Aleppo province was hit on Monday, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). As a result, 18 of 31 trucks were destroyed and at least 21 individuals were killed. A number of US military officials claimed that Russia was responsible, while Russia called for a thorough investigation into the incident.



On September 9, US Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov brokered a ceasefire in Syria that took effect three days later. The agreement called for unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid and stipulated that only designated terror groups would be targeted in military strikes.

Boris Johnson just had his first run in with Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, and he got destroyed via Facebook.In an article on The Duran last week by Numan Abd al-Wahid entitled, "How becoming British Foreign Secretary made Boris Johnson flip on Syria" , we examined Boris Johnson's sudden flip flop on Syria, right after he was appointed British FM.Author al-Wahid notes...Boris' flip flop is easy to explain. By becoming British FM, Johnson got a gold card entrance into the globalist club.The global elite, neocons, and Saudi monarchy probably had a nice sit down with Boris and "persuaded" the malleable ex-London mayor to see things their way on Syria and Russia.Now Boris, the flip flopping, Saudi/neocon foot soldier is hitting the TV circuit to promote the war in Syria, and do his part to prop up ISIS and Al Nusra/Al Qaeda...Johnson went on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, and made some fascinating claims. Most notably...Unfortunately for Boris, he is not reading The Duran or Moon of Alabama , otherwise he would have known that evidence is now very much showing that a US Hellfire missile from a Predator Drone most likely set the UN convoy ablaze.Luckily Russia has assembled a well qualified, sharp team of diplomats at the Foreign Ministry.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova noted Boris' ridiculous claims and took to Facebook to respond to Johnson's accusation regarding Russia's role in Syria.Zakharova said that the United Kingdom is guilty of protracting and worsening violence in Iraq, and in the kindest of gestures fixed Boris' statement, so that it reflects facts on the ground.How small of a man must Boris Johnson feel like...
