The trial of a husband and wife accused of writing a $40,000 bad check to a rice exporting company they owed money to was heard at the Phnom Penh Municipal Court yesterday.



Hoeu Chy, 48, and his wife Huy Him, 46, were charged with issuing a bad check in September 2015 to rice exporting firm Mekong Olisa, whose unnamed owner is the plaintiff in the case, said judge Heng Kesaro.



“They received the money [$70,000] from the plaintiff and promised to sell rice to the plaintiff’s company,” he stated.



“But after receiving the money from the plaintiff, they did not provide the rice to the plaintiff as promised. When the plaintiff demanded they refund the money, they then issued the bad check to him,” he added.



According to court documents, in 2008 the defendants signed a contract with Mekong Olisa to provide them with rice to export to Malaysia. They received $70,000 in advance to secure suitable rice supplies, but failed to do so.



After Mekong Olisa demanded the money back, the pair were accused of delaying repayment, claiming a lack of funds. In August 2014, they finally wrote a check for $40,000 from their Acleda bank account, but when the plaintiff attempted to cash it, the account was discovered to be empty.



It wasn’t until September 2015, after failed attempts to contact the pair, that Mekong Olisa filed a complaint against them, demanding $100,000 and leading to Mr. Chy’s arrest and Ms. Him being placed under court supervision.



In court yesterday, Mr. Chy admitted to writing the bad check, but asked the judges to release him so he could earn the money to be pay what he owed.



“The reason I decided to write the check for the plaintiff was because he promised not to sue me if I paid him, but I didn’t have any money,” he said.



“I would like to ask the court to reduce my sentence so that I will be able to come out from the prison and make the money to return back to the plaintiff,” he said, adding that he had acted alone in the fraud and his wife was innocent.



However, deputy court prosecutor Khieu Phalla asked the judges to uphold the charges against both of them.



“I would like to suggest that the judge punish both of them following the law.”



Their verdict is due on September 29.
