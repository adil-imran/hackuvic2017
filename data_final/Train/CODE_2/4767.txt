Three former governors investigated by their sucessors

Abuja - Three former state governors in the North are facing investigations by their predecessors over alleged abuse of financial regulations and corruption leveled against them, Daily Trust reports.



In Katsina state, the present administration of Governor Aminu Bello Masari on Wednesday demanded for the prosecution all those involved in the alleged violation of standard financial guidelines in the administration of the state’s office of the Subsidy Reinvestment Program (SURE-P), which led to a loss of about N9.7 billion.



At the continuation of hearing on the activities of SURE-P under former governor, Ibrahim Shehu Shema, the Special Adviser to Masari on Budget, Abdullahi Imam told the commission that billions of naira could not be accounted for under SURE-P.

In Plateau state, Governor Simon Bako Lalong inaugurated a six man judicial commission of inquiry headed by a justice of the court of Appeal, Stephen Adah to probe all financial transactions during the eight years administration of his predecessor, Senator Jonah David Jang.

Lalong at the inauguration said the commission was not for persecution but to set a solid foundation for the pursuit of that which will guarantee the prosperity of the people adding that; “It is also not a witch-hunt but a hunt for that which has probably been hidden from our citizens.”



Also in Jigawa state, the state House of Assembly has commenced investigation on alleged embezzlement of N13 billion by the immediate past government of Governor Sule Lamido.



The Speaker of the State House of Assembly, Idris Garba dropped the hint yesterday while briefing newsmen in Dutse, saying the ongoing investigation covers a period from 2008 to 2015.



He stressed that the misappropriation of the fund was discovered to have been perpetrated in the state Ministry for Local Government.
