NEW DELHI: Police can call a Good Samaritan for examination only once if he opts to be a witness in a road accident . In a recent notification, the road transport ministry has said in case a statement is to be recorded, it should be done in a single examination.Complying with the direction of the Supreme Court order of March, the ministry has added the new provision in the standard operating procedures (SOP) for dealing with those who either inform police about road crashes or rush the injured to hospital. "The affidavit of Good Samaritan, if filed, shall be treated as complete statement by police while conducting the investigation," the notification said.On an average, 400 people lost their lives in road crashes every day in 2015. According to the government's own estimates, half of these deaths can be prevented by providing quick medical care within the first hour of a crash, which is called the 'Golden Hour'.A study by Save Life Foundation had flagged how nearly three-fourth of bystanders are unlikely to help road crash victims and almost nine of ten are unlikely to help due for fear of legal hassles and repeated questioning by police.A ministry official said this provision will help end the fear of bystanders, who hesitate to help road crash victims. "The point here is should a Good Samaritan be called to a police station or examined several times. Complying with the SC order, we have made things clear to end any scope of harassment of such persons," he said.Several recent incidents brought out how things had not changed much on the ground. In August, a man hit by a tempo bled on a Delhi road for 90 minutes and none came to help him. It grabbed national attention."There are several such examples of people showing little concern since most of them are still not aware about the new law. Both police and the state administration must carry out campaigns to take this message to the people that police won't harass Good Samaritans," said S P Singh of IRTFT, a Delhi-based think tank on transport issues.
