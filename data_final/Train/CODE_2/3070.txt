Megyn Kelly calls Juanita Broaddrick a Liar

American Thinker ^ | October 11, 2016 | Daniel John Sobieski

Posted on by Kaslin

In the post-debate analysis of Trump/s spot-on rebuttal of Team Clintons exploitation of the 2005 Trump locker room remarks, Megyn Kelly sparred with Trump manager Kelly Anne Conway over Trumps trotting out of some of Bills bimbo eruptions in a pre-debate press conference. In what will undoubtedly be Team Clintons defense, Megyn Kelly claimed that Clinton rape accuser Juanita Broaddrick denied any rape in a 1998 affidavit.

Close, but no cigar, Megyn. The story is a little more complicated than that. It was not that her story was false as Megyn Kelly implied. Like many rape victims, Broaddrick felt no one would believe her and she simply wanted to put it behind her and not be forced to relive it, particularly in any legal setting: she resisted interviews, fearing no one would believe her charge against a popular President. As Breitbart reported in 2014:

In January of 1999, a month after Clintons impeachment by the House -- and in the midst of the Senate trial grappling with whether Monica Lewinsky should testify -- Broaddrick finally agreed to meet NBCs Lisa Myers for an interview Broaddricks decision to go forward with an interview came after she contemplated all the layers of tawdry rumor about her that had multiplied in the wake of the other, larger scandal involving the president.

Do not watch Fox News. They have sold out to the Leftist Murdoch family who support the Clinton Crime Syndicate and Massage Parlor. Hannity should leave when his contract expires and run for office himself or just go fishing. He is the only conservative left at Fox News.

Hillary may have spared these women because Bill “scored them high, second pass”.

Hillary Clinton pressured all the women to sign a false affidavit before Ken Star got to them. They were all allowef to recant the affidavit, were given immunity BUT had to answer every question truthfully with as many interviews as the prosecutor wanted.

He can continue in radio until he finds another place for a television show.

Why on earth would ant woman willingly subject herself to this kind of attention/scrutiny over so long a period unless it really did happen. And if these are just “bimbo eruptions,” that would suggest they’re random and that they could happen to any president. But I don’t know of any other president that this many “bimbo eruptions.” Where there’s smoke, there’s fire, and there’s so much smoke when it comes to Clinton, including the one case where he was caught.

Hannity should leave when his contract expires and run for office himself or just go fishing. He is the only conservative left at Fox News. I think Hannity and Tarantino should go over to OANN. Together with Tommi Lahren They could raise that channel to compete with FNC. Greta could be on for the more liberal view.

I am surprised hillary didnt kill these women If Hillary gets in, those women will be found dead of "suicide". Or perhaps Hillary will just switch to a more direct approach of death squads. It's not like there would be any legal consequence for her. Perhaps she can appoint Comey as head of the death squads. He's proved his loyalty to her over everything including the law.

I don’t know the particulars of this case (and don’t want to), but the fact that there are just so many cases involving this former president — and hardly any involving any living president (no “bimbo eruptions” for Bush, Bush II, Obama, Carter that I know of), is damning itself even if you give Clinton every benefit of the doubt.

None, but the USC poll seems to me to be a bit more honest and even that misses the “monster vote”, IMHO.

With Rupert Murdoch retiring, his leftwing son is taking over. I heard that from Megyn Kelly and I was nearly in shock. And Trump did real well in the debate, much to Megy’s discomfort.

Megyn outs herself as a Media BrownShirt. She's on Juanita Broaddrick like Brown Shirts on a Jew. Wonder if decent American are going to stand around watching the Media Brown Shirts beat up ordinary Americans for supporting Trump, and opposing The Criminal Hillary?

Hannity and Lou Dobbs (Fox Business) are the only people worth watching on Fox. Joy Behar (Hillary surrogate) called the Clinton victims “tramps.” This comment by Kelly would be enough to get a conservative suspended or even fired. Kelly will be given a pass because she’s anti-Trump. Her orders, btw, are from the top. Murdoch is on the board of an open borders group and Fox as a network is anti-Trump, as are Murdoch’s newspapers.

Hey, meGYN!

Maybe all he did was grab her p*$$y? Maybe you want Bill to grab yours? Enquiring minds want to know!

Since 1990, I’ve always asked the same question...As a politician, is Bill Clinton a “master debater” or simply a “cunning linguist”?

An ASIDE: Is anyone else here on FR offended by the “bare-naked” use of the media using the word ^pussy^? Is there a point at which, since everyone says it in conversation that we must accept it as part of the cultural ken? I prefer those on FR to use “cloaked” references to such genitalia; male or female.

For “undecideds” it probably doesn’t help to have a debate on whether she’s a liar. We know (no discussion needed) * Bill abused at least a few women

* Bill lied about it at least a few times

* Bill paid a big settlement and lost his law license

* Hillary lied and helped cover up Bill’s abuse

* Many women claim Hillary threatened them

* Many women are willing to come public If the Clintons are put back in the white house we will have 4 (or 8) years debating who is lying about Bill’s sex life. Throw in the email and foundation issues and you are guaranteed a term full of scandals. Even if there are no new ones (unlikely) there are decades old scandals that won’t go away. That’s what we get with Hillary.

“Hillary Clinton pressured all the women to sign a false affidavit before Ken Star got to them” If that’s true then why haven’t the women spoken of it?

Can't listen to, or watch, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, pontificate, repeat, repeat, interrupt, pontificate, repeat, repeat and repeat Hannity. Totally agree. Hadn't watched Hannity for a few years until recently. He has some good guests on but his constant interruptions and talking over them drives me nuts. He's as bad if not worse than BOR. Quit listening to his radio show long ago. Too monotonous, too much chaos, too many of his lib buddies.

Believe no polls. Instead look at the enthusiasm for Trump compared to Hitlery. Trump has massive crowds at his events, Hitlery has nothing in comparison. Read viewer comments at the end of news articles and videos, they run massively in favor of Trump. Take a drive and look for yard signs. Four years ago there was massive support shown for obama, that does not exist today (at least where I live). Look at the social media, many Blacks are showing open support for Trump, that did not happen for Romney. There is really a long list of indicators showing Trump has popular support, whereas Hitlery has only extreme die hard lefist + establishment support. I actually find the posting of numerous polls irritating, so I seldom read the threads, even when they show Trump up. They are like market crash predictions or weather reports - which not based on fact. They are based on the honesty of those taking the polls and the honesty of those being called.

Its suppose to be common knowledge that they all signed affidavits pressured from Hillary’s small group that she put together and called the bimbo Patrol. Actually Hillary in all likelihood wrote the affidavits that they signed.

Ok. Broaddrick has given conflicting statements. I’d like to know why Megan chose the “no rape” one. Bill has a huge track record of abusing women. Seems like the “was raped” one better fits Bill’s behavior. But we know the Hillary campaign staff includes the media. Holy smoke it’s crazy what’s happening.
