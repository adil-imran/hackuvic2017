Will fin breid, barley-bree an paintit room. Whan MacLean meets wi's friens in Springburn. Aa thae roses an geeans will turn tae blume. An a black laud frae yont Nyanga. Dings the fell gallows o the burghers doun.

Black an white ane-til-ither mairriet. Mak the vile barracks o thair maisters bare. Sae come aa ye at hame wi freedom. Never heed whit the houdies croak for Doom. In yer hous aa the bairns o Aidam.

Tak the road an seek ither loanins. Wi thair ill-ploys tae sport an play. Nae mair will our bonnie callants. Merch tae war whan our braggarts crousely craw. Nor wee weans frae pitheid an clachan. Murn the ships sailin doun the Broomielaw. Broken faimilies in launs we've hairriet. Will curse 'Scotlan the Brave' nae mair, nae mair.

Roch the win i the clear day's dawin. Blaws the clouds heilster-gowdie owre the bay. But thair's mair nor a roch win blawin. Thro the Great Glen o the warl the day. It's a thocht that wad gar our rottans. Aa thae rogues that gang gallus fresh an gay.

A SECOND national strike across Scotland’s colleges will take place in a dispute over pay.

A SECOND national strike across Scotland’s colleges will take place in a dispute over pay.

Union members at 20 colleges across the country will strike on Tuesday September 6.

Members voted overwhelmingly for industrial action in a dispute which Unison claims results from college bosses awarding lecturing staff a £450 rise compared with the £230 increase they say has been offered to most support staff.

The strike aims to secure the support staff – including cleaners, administrators and technicians – parity with lecturers after talks between Unison, GMB, Unite and college bosses last week failed to find a resolution.

Lecturing staff at colleges across Scotland went on strike for a day in March earlier this year which centred on disputes over pay and led to the £450 settlement.

Chris Greenshields, chairman of Unison’s further education committee, said: “Our demand is simple and fair. Pay college support staff the same flat rate rise of £450 that you gave teaching colleagues.

“We work for the same colleges, help deliver the same courses, support the same students and deserve the same cost of living increase.”

Unison’s Scottish organiser John Gallacher said: “Striking is a last resort but we will support our members in every way possible to achieve the same fair and reasonable pay settlement as already paid out to teaching colleagues.

“In a sector which sees top principals paid close to the salary of the Scottish First Minister, we should not be fighting over the difference between £230 and £450 for some 2,500 staff.

“Unison has written to every principal and every MSP in a last-ditch attempt to avoid this unnecessary and damaging dispute.”

Staff at the following colleges plan to strike: Ayrshire, Borders, City of Glasgow, Dumfries and Galloway, Dundee and Angus, Edinburgh, Fife, Forth Valley, Glasgow Clyde, Glasgow Kelvin, Inverness, Lews Castle, Moray, New College Lanarkshire, North East, North Highland, Perth, South Lanarkshire, West, West Lothian.

Scottish Labour education spokesman Iain Gray said: “SNP ministers promised college staff equal pay for equal work, then walked away from that promise.”
