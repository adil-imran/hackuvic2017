In recent years, some terms used to make sense of this phenomenon include: Radical Islam, Islamic terrorism, political Islam, Salafi-Wahhabi Islam, or extremist Islam. Due to political correctness, world leaders like US president Barack Obama have refused to see any link with Islam. Terms like "political Islam" do assist world leaders in engaging with this problem sometimes, but at other times, these expressions obscure the gravity of the terrorist threat. So, the question is: Should it be called Islamic terrorism or something else?Let me cite some points as to why it must be called jihadi terrorism. One, terms like "Islamic" or "jihadi" are used by Al-Qaeda, the Taliban and the Islamic State themselves to describe their actions. They do not say that (Jamaat-e-Islami founder) Maulana Maududi or (Egyptian theologian) Syed Qutb started jihad. They cite the Quranic verses and Hadiths (sayings and deeds of Prophet Muhammad) to justify their actions. These groups reject democracy and advocate imposition of Shari'a in non-Muslim and Muslim countries. They are therefore called jihadis or Islamists.File image of Tufail Ahmad. Twitter @tufailelifThree, in India, not all fighters are called Hindu terrorists. Naxalite terrorists who are Hindus are not called Hindu terrorists because they do not advocate Hindu rule. But, members of Abhinav Bharat were called Hindu or saffron terrorists because they stood for Hindu rule. Shiv Sena has repeatedly called for "Hindu suicide bombers" to attack Pakistan.Five arguments answered by jihadisLet's take up some key arguments concerning jihad and examine how jihadis are responding.Argument 1: Islam is a peaceful religionA major argument by apologists of Islamism is that the prophet ordered amnesty for everyone on the day of the Victory of Mecca. Al-Qaeda militant Ustad Farooq pointed out that this is historically incorrect. On that day, the prophet was informed that there were around 10 people, including women, who had committed blasphemy against him. He ordered that even if they were found hanging by the curtains of the Kaaba, they deserve no respect and should be killed. And they were indeed killed.Argument 2: Jihad means personally striving to become a pious MuslimThere are many such verses in the Quran.Quetta attack: A primer on Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, who allegedly carried out strikeIslamic State turns to alternate sources of income as they continue to lose territorySyria conflict: Rebels launch Aleppo offensive to break siegeArgument 3: Room to criticise IslamArgument 4: Mosques cannot be attacked and suicide bombings not permitted in Islam In 2013, a Taliban magazine cited two Quranic verses to rationalise suicide attacks. Verse 29:64 reads: "And this life of the world is only amusement and play! Verily, the home of the Hereafter, that is the life indeed..." Verse 3:169 reads: "Think not of those who are killed in the way of Allah as dead. No, they are alive, with their Lord."Argument 5: Islam protects minoritiesIslamic clerics and common Muslims argue that the Quran advocates peace. Indeed, it does. There are numerous verses that teach love, peace and brotherhood. Islam is a peaceful religion, and the majority of Muslims are peaceful. However, it is equally true that there are numerous verses in the Quran that teach hate and war against non-Muslims. For a correct understanding, it is essential to admit this duality of the situation: Islam is peaceful and isn't peaceful — both at the same time.Stay tuned for the final segment of Ahmad's speech:Pakistan and West Indies in UAE, 3 Test Series, 2016New Zealand in India, 5 ODI Series, 2016Sri Lanka in Zimbabwe, 2 Test Series, 2016England in Bangladesh, 2 Test Series, 2016New Zealand in India, 5 ODI Series, 2016New Zealand in India, 5 ODI Series, 2016Pakistan and West Indies in UAE, 3 Test Series, 2016New Zealand in India, 5 ODI Series, 2016England in Bangladesh, 2 Test Series, 2016New Zealand in India, 5 ODI Series, 2016South Africa in Australia, 3 Test Series, 2016 AUS vs SA - Nov 3rd, 2016, 08:00 AM ISTPapua New Guinea in Hong Kong, 3 ODI Series, 2016 HK vs PNG - Nov 4th, 2016, 07:00 AM ISTPapua New Guinea in Hong Kong, 3 ODI Series, 2016 HK vs PNG - Nov 6th, 2016, 07:00 AM ISTSri Lanka in Zimbabwe, 2 Test Series, 2016 ZIM vs SL - Nov 6th, 2016, 01:00 PM ISTPapua New Guinea in Hong Kong, 3 ODI Series, 2016 HK vs PNG - Nov 8th, 2016, 07:00 AM ISTEngland in India, 5 Test Series, 2016 IND vs ENG - Nov 9th, 2016, 09:30 AM ISTSouth Africa in Australia, 3 Test Series, 2016 AUS vs SA - Nov 12th, 2016, 05:00 AM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 ZIM vs SL - Nov 14th, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 SL vs WI - Nov 16th, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTPakistan in New Zealand, 2 Test Series, 2016 NZ vs PAK - Nov 17th, 2016, 03:00 AM IST
