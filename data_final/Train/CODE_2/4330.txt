POLITICO Brussels Playbook, presented by EPP Group: State of the Union day — Tusk’s ten commandments — New ECA president

It’s EU State of the Union day … and Donald Tusk has news for you: He has created his own shadow State of the Union speech, and conveniently it arrived in reporters’ inboxes just in time for you to read it alongside Jean-Claude Juncker’s speech at 9 a.m. this morning. Officially, it’s a five-page letter to EU leaders outlining where he sees the EU going if the special Bratislava summit is a success.

TUSK’S TEN COMMANDMENTS: Tusk’s letter is sub-headed with roman numerals, just like the Ten Commandments. Playbook took the hint. There were few surprises in the document, the core of which Playbook previewed on Monday via a “press lines” document slipped to POLITICO.

David Herszenhorn, POLITICO’s new chief Brussels correspondent, writes that Tusk urged EU leaders to take a “coolheaded” approach and to “stick to the Treaty” in upcoming negotiations with Britain over its exit from the EU. He also warned “it would be a fatal error to assume that the negative result in the U.K. referendum represents a specifically British issue.” http://politi.co/2cEhDF0

DON’T DESPAIR — EU-APPROVED EMOJIS ARE AVAILABLE FOR YOU TO EXPRESS EURO-SELF! Craig Winneker helps you cut to the chase, so you can explain your real emotions about today’s speech (and other EU dealings) in a single image. http://politi.co/2c9jXnb

**A message from the EPP Group: “We have to bring Europe back to the people again”, says our Chairman Manfred Weber in today’s State of the European Union debate. This can be achieved by initiatives such as continuation of the investment plan, strengthening EU external border protection as well as focusing EU efforts where they’re needed. Follow live from 9am!**

THE SOTEU’S ORIGINAL SIN: Readers often ask how the EU version of the State of the Union compares to the American original. In short, it doesn’t, at least not directly. Unlike the U.S. or French heads of state, for example, the European Commission president is not directly elected. When you don’t speak for people, it’s harder to speak to them. That fundamental disconnect hobbles the speech from the beginning, doubly so because it is still visible enough that people will notice errors or gaffes, without bothering to credit the good parts.

JUNCKER’S TASK TODAY: In 2016, the EU landscape is vastly different to last year. In 2015, Juncker offered a statesman’s speech from the heart, weeks after the Union had stared into the abyss over Greece, and as it was splintering over how to manage refugees. The reviews were mixed. The U.K. has now voted for Brexit, and there is no immediate crisis unfolding. That has allowed a more organized Council President Donald Tusk to start a Continent-wide leaders debate about how to make the EU coherent again. It will be Juncker’s task to fit into that slipstream and help answer that question, rather than stake out his own singular vision of the Union.

HOW THE COMMISSION IS PITCHING IT: The key phrase is “lowering expectations.” This year, Juncker will follow a script deliberately aimed at national leaders, not MEPs, in an attempt to shape the Bratislava discussions on Friday. While trying to avoid confrontation with national governments, the Commission won’t be shy about contrasting with them either. The speech and debate will be followed by a press conference with Commissioners Federica Mogherini and Frans Timmermans on security, and Andrus Ansip and Günther Oettinger on digital single market proposals.

DID JUNCKER DELIVER ON HIS 2015 SOTEU PROMISES? POLITICO fact-checks Juncker’s promises from a year ago, from migration policy to economic reform to climate action. Overall, the president has managed to deliver on some of his pledges — on climate, somewhat more assertive foreign policy and more tailor-made assistance to Greece — but failed in other areas, such as a financial transaction tax that’s languishing in Council and falling short on African development funds. http://politi.co/2c7tUwo

WHAT TO EXPECT FROM TODAY’S SOTEU SPEECH. It’s not going to be short; settle in for a three-language, hour-plus speech. Juncker will kick-off with a tour of European values, then focus on the only points of consensus he could find in his consultations: fixing the economy and increasing security. Economic announcements will include: Doubling the EFSI (Juncker investment plan) both in time and money; a new fund for Africa (how it’s different from the fund started in 2015 is unclear); copyright reform; overhaul of the telecoms legal framework.

Security announcements will include: Hastening the launch of the European border guard to October from December; proposing an EU version of the U.S.’s ESTA system of pre-registration for travelers; combining national terror databases; backing Franco-German defense cooperation efforts.

PRAISE TO THE DEAR LEADER: Commission departments have been named and shamed over their level of enthusiasm for today’s speech. They were asked by the Berlaymont to report on whether they’ve organized viewing parties for the speech (moderated by senior staff is the preference, with pre-speech pep talks), and it turns out that as of last week only 34 percent of departments had something planned.

SOTEU FOR THE YOUTUBE GENERATION. Three social media stars: Jonas Ems, Laetitia Birbes, and Łukasz Jakóbiak are traveling from their homes in Germany, France and Poland to interview President Juncker in the Berlaymont Thursday at 11 a.m. Ems is an author as well as a YouTuber, Birbes is a green activist and Jakóbiak counts Lady Gaga and the TED-talk folk among his fans.

WHAT BRUSSELS THINKS ABOUT SOTEU (SPOILER ALERT: THEY THINK BRATISLAVA MATTERS MORE) … Tuesday night Playbook hosted dinner for 12 members of the Brussels bubble to talk State of the Union, on the basis their views be kept anonymous. The group had low expectations of Juncker’s speech (much as Juncker’s team has hoped for) and mostly thought the Bratislava summit would be better or more important. They believed it was up to the “real leaders” at the summit to shape a new vision for Europe, but were sad that so little common ground now existed for that vision to take root.

The group wanted Juncker to respond to the fact that “a lot of ordinary people now just don’t trust politicians,” and most wanted him to avoid confrontation with national governments and instead be positive. “We need some symbols that unite us,” urged one guest.

Defense of the Commission … “The Commission can’t solve what the member states don’t want to solve.”

Criticisms of the Commission and SOTEU included:

“The national governments have responsibility for delivering real services, they don’t have time for the Commission’s glossy ideas.”

“Pretending everyone else failed except you isn’t right.”

“Last year’s SOTEU was meandering, it was not serious, it was too casual, and it just fed Euroskeptics in Britain.”

“It’s the two institutions that don’t matter talking to each other. He’s absolutely not relevant.”

Views on why Euroskepticism and populism are rising …

“The Brexit debate revealed a nerve across the EU of large sections of the population thinking the elites have done nothing for them. We absolutely have to listen to this.”

“People voted against the U.K.’s and EU’s financial interests because they don’t associate their lives with those interests.”

“The EU is the inverse of the U.S. In the U.S. you have this strong focus on an external policy and unity, and people can basically do what they want from state to state economically and socially. In the EU you have people telling window cleaners how to do their jobs but they have no view on Syria.”

EASTERN EUROPE TO OFFER A NEW EUROPEAN MENU AT SUMMIT: Poland’s Prime Minister Beata Szydło is the current chair of the Visegrad Group of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. The BBC writes Szydło reckons Visegrad has “a recipe for the EU” to bring it closer to its disenchanted citizens in the wake of Brexit … But what is that recipe? What binds these four countries, beyond a penchant for smoked meats and sour cream?” http://bbc.in/2cB2R0x

PARLIAMENT — EPP WILL NOMINATE OWN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT: Manfred Weber, the European People’s Party chief in Parliament, told Germany’s Bild newspaper the EPP would nominate a candidate for the EP’s presidential race in January 2017 to replace current President Martin Schulz.

ECA — PARLIAMENT REJECTS MALTESE COURT CANDIDATE: MEPs voted against Leo Brincat, Malta’s former environment minister, 381 to 229, due to concerns about the Maltese government’s inaction over the Panama Papers scandal. A decision to ignore the non-binding vote and continue with his nomination has infuriated MEPs ahead of the country’s Council of Europe presidency. Maltese Labour MEPs blame opposition Nationalists for the “national humiliation” but are seemingly failing to note that MEPs from across the political spectrum voted Brincat down, not just the EPP.

DIVORCE IN THE LAND OF THE SUPER RICH: Divorce laws in Monaco are intended to protect the super wealthy, ensuring they don’t lose their assets in case of a split. And they do not favor women. “All the deeds and bank accounts remain with the person whose name they were under before marriage. Courts are known to be stingy with alimony, believing in the individual’s capacity to ‘bounce back.'” Dana Kennedy: http://politi.co/2cdqyem

**A message from the EPP Group: Security of our citizens matters — it’s a long term commitment of the EPP Group that has already proposed a European Defence Union. We call for launching a permanent structured cooperation in order to stop current uncoordinated military cooperation. For stronger crisis management, it is necessary to establish a permanent operational military headquarters and make use of the existing EU Battle Groups in order to stop slow negotiations over troop contributions. Finally, EU financing of defence research can boost military cooperation and make Europe’s defence industry stronger in global competition. European Defence has been a long-standing goal of the EPP Group. Find out more on our position on Defence.**
