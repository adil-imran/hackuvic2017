Rudy Giuliani  I Could Convict Crooked Hillary on 26 Counts

After last nights debate, Rudy Giuliani appeared on Sean Hannitys after-debate show. He said that Donald Trump delivered one of the biggest knockouts in presidential debate history, and that if he were the Attorney General he could prosecute Hillary Clinton on violations of 26 different criminal statutes.

With any luck he will get his chance. GO TRUMP GO



To: GilGil

Then why doesn’t he? He’s protecting here?



To: nickcarraway

He’s not AG yet. Not much he can do right now.



To: GilGil

Why stop there, indict the cabal!



To: GilGil

Obama could pardon her. It’s like Iran releasing the hostages the minute Reagan took office. Less work for everybody.

To: GilGil

Nobody can convict Hillary. She'll just do another 'INTERVENTION'.



To: Bon mots

Can’t wait for that smirk and laugh to be wiped off her face!

don’t be stupid....THINK!...His authority is what????...You indite her-e!



To: GilGil

He is the one making claims, he should back them up. He didn’t say, “If I was AG...”



To: GilGil

Rudy wants her ass sooooooooo bad...lol



To: M-cubed

Giuliani is the one making claims. He should follow through or shut his liberal mouth.



To: GilGil

Rudy, You're Hired! Nail That Traitor!

Obama has a Pardon ready to go for Hillary to protect himself

To: DIRTYSECRET

Obama could pardon her. No he can't. She has not been tried nor convicted. That is the beauty about Comey not recommending charges......she is fair game if Trump wins. Lois Lerner (IRS) should not feel too comfortable either.

in the article it’s written that he did.

By telling her she would be in jail, I think he put his life in danger. He may need to beef up his security. Do I think the Clinton crime machine would force him to walk through Fort Marcy Park? Absolutely, totally, completely, 100% YES.

so you should indite her!...or shut up your liberal mouth!!! He was explaining as a past prosecutor....Get it now?????



To: Salvavida

No he can't. She has not been tried nor convicted. Ford pardoned Nixon. He hadn't been tried or convicted of anything either.

You can see the tone of the media coverage has changed since the debate. The Clinton’s know they are going to the slammer if they don’t win. Things haven’t even started to get nasty yet.

Ford pardoned Nixon. He hadn't been tried or convicted of anything either. Good point. I'm quite sure he's thought of that. But I would offer Ford's pardon had no legal basis under the definition of a pardon or reprieve, and it was not tested. He'll fill the vacant SCOTUS seat, and that will set the table.

As sick in poor health as she is she won’t see a second of jail time.

You are right. It was never tested. Who knows what would have happened if it had.

On the other hand, Odumbo would do it, and defy anyone to test it. Do you think any RINO would challenge it? Not likely. Either way, she will continue to walk. I just hope Trump's administration can nail Lois Lerner and that Koskinen character, and impeach Comey. These people nauseate me. Hey, corruption can be cleaned up. Just ask Duterte.

PROCLAMATION 4311 NOW, THEREFORE, I, GERALD R. FORD, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, pursuant to the pardon power conferred upon me by Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution, have granted and by these presents do grant a full, free, and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States which he, Richard Nixon, has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 20, 1969 through August 9, 1974.



To: Salvavida

You are mistaken, there is clear precedent for a presidential pardon before any charges have been brought: Ford pardoned Nixon for all possible criminal acts during the entirety of the Nixon admin. It was a “pre-emptive” pardon and applied to any possible charges that could be brought for Nixon’s acts during his time in office.

Start by freezing the accounts at the Clinton foundation



To: Parley Baer

Rudy is just the man qualified and experienced enough to succeed in doing it. Were Rudy to take down the entire Clinton Crime Family Syndicate and incarcerate the lot of them it would go down in the annals of history as one of the greatest judicial accomplishments since the foundation of the country. That said, President Trump may have another post in mind for Rudy.

Then why doesnt he? Hes protecting here? Really? He has no standing at this time. It's like someone who doesn't donate to FR asking someone else what they are doing to be useful.....

Ford pardoned Nixon. However, Ford was not directly or indirectly involved in Nixon's crimes. Given the facts surrounding the botched FBI and INjustice department "investigations" the same can not be said of Obama and Hillary. If it can be proven to a Special Prosecutor and Grand Jury that Obama himself was actively involved and complicit in any number of Hillary Clinton's felonious crimes and activities then his so-called "pardons" could be nullified: It would be like Al Capone trying to pardon Frank Niti. Obama's pardon could also be nullified if it can be shown that Obama ordered and or put pressure on FBI director Comey the FBI, and or the Justice Department to obstruct justice, destroy evidence, or squash their investigation of Hillary Clinton because Obama would then be an "acesory after the fact": an active participant in the crime syndicate and hence legally disqualified from issuing any pardon of Hillary or her Clinton Crime Family Syndicate associates. Given what Trump said during the second debate, I wouldn't be surprised in the least to learn that Trump already has a team of legal experts scouring the Law for legal presidents to successfully negate Obama's Presidential pardon of Hillary Clinton and all of her surrogates should he issue them.

Tbat has no legal basis. There is no definition that includes a hypothetical pardon. The only reason Tricky Dick didn't go to jail, is no one challenged it. Look at Article II, Section 2: there is no such language that allows this; therefore, the definition has to be extracted from a recognized legal definition. If Barky does decide to "pardon" her, it most definitely can be challenged, right after the final SCOTUS seat is filled.
