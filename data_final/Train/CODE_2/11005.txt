Every weekend, This is Money rounds up the share tips from the Sunday newspapers.

This week, Midas runs the rule over luxury shoe brand Jimmy Choo and updates on health firm OptiBiotix.

Meanwhile, the Sunday Telegraph looks at broadcaster Sky and the Sunday Times takes a look at doorstep lender Provident Financial.

The global economy and financial markets have rarely looked so uncertain. But the solution may be to step out in some Jimmy Choos.

The luxury footwear maker appears to be weathering the unease in consumer markets.

It is still one of the fastest growing luxury brands in the world and, crucially for UK investors, this London-listed fashion name is set to benefit hugely from the slump in the value of the pound.

In 2015, OptiBiotix Health was a darling of the market. Midas tipped the shares in July at 33.5p and by the end of the year, they were 77.5p.

Since then, the performance has been pedestrian and today the stock is 67p, having drifted for most of 2016.

Investors may feel impatient, but now is not the time to sell.

OptiBiotix is focused on an area that is increasingly recognised as playing a fundamental role in our health and wellbeing, the business is expected to expand considerably over the next two to three years and the shares should respond accordingly.

SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

Sky has made bold steps in recent months as it attempts to steal a march on its competitors by pushing into new markets and investing heavily in new technology.

Last month, analysts at Morgan Stanley suggest Sky's shares were 'overweight', having been oversold after a sharp decline since the beginning of the year.

The bank said Sky now traders at close to its lowest market relative multiple in the past decade.

Even though analysts have recently lowered their price target for the stock, from £10.25 to £10, if the company can continue to hold its viewers, the shares should continue to grow modestly. Hold.

SUNDAY TIMES

Like virtually every public company that does most of its business on these shores, Provident Financial's shares folded like a tent after Brexit.

In two days they dropped 26 per cent, losing more than £1billion in value. Chief executive Peter Crook was unperturbed. As was Chris Sweeney, head of Provident's Vanquis Bank and corporate affairs chief Nick Boakes. All three bought the cheap shares.

The gambit has paid off nicely. Provident has already roared past its pre-Brexit level.
