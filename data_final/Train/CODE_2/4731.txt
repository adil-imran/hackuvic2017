Trumps truest believers start to worry: You could easily lose this election

Wash Post via MSN ^ | 10-11-2016 | Jenna Johnson

Posted on by tcrlaf

The morning after the vice-presidential debate, Cathy Frasca woke at 5 a.m. and hand-wrote a four-page letter to Donald Trump that said: It is obvious that you could easily lose this election.

The 89-year-old grandmother urged Trump to release his taxes, ignore the controversies that Hillary Clinton tries to start, stop tweeting at 3 a.m. and remember that Bill Clinton is not running for election, so please avoid using precious time to discuss his sex life. Instead, Frasca wrote, Trump should tell voters about how he will improve the country.

You know what to do but time is running out, she wrote in closing. My prayers are with you always.

As Trump bounces from one controversy to another and Hillary Clinton gains in the polls, there is a growing realization among some of his most devoted supporters that he could lose the election. They still hope he will win, as the idea of another President Clinton angers and scares them. They blame the Republican Party for not doing enough to support its nominee, the media for focusing on comments Trump made years ago and Democrats who, they say, rigged the system. But they also place a little blame on Trump.

SNIP-

At rallies like these, Trump can live in a world where he is still winning. He was introduced as the next president and greeted by a screaming crowd of 2,500 while, he said, thousands and thousands more waited outside. There were no polls showing Clinton with a double-digit lead, no debate moderators grilling him on the Syrian conflict, no party leaders telling him to tone it down.

Here, Trump declared himself the winner of the debate, berated the media and attacked Clinton without any interruptions from fact-checkers.

WOW... I'm literally watching Soviet-style Media at it's best. Trying to create the illusion that Trump is LOSING, and will WITHDRAW from the race. Several Wash Post articles out tonight that all trash Trump, saying he should resign, withdraw, whatever.



To: tcrlaf

The Soviet media is focusing on Trump, because a focus on Clinton is a losing situation. They will make up thousands of reasons to focus on Trump, all of them weak. “The 89-year-old grandmother urged Trump...” Silly and weak.

Actually yes he is, just like we got saddled with Hillary in 1992, only difference is that this time around Bill will be the bitch.



To: Trump20162020

All The Washington Post does is bash Donald Trump, all day, every day. It's also Rinos. Latest case, Charles Kraphammer talking on O'Reilly's show. The former liberal turned Rino was crapping on Trump saying never before has a candidate wanted to come down hard to punish an opponent like Trump wanting to jail Hillary after being elected. O'Reilly kept trying to correct Krauthammer by saying the Attorney General would indict and jail Hillary based on the evidence, but Krauthammer kept at it with the BS that Trump would unfairly jail and kill his enemies! Unbelievable! Although we can insinuate that the Clintons probably have assassinated enemies. I think Trump will prevail over these evil people. He has to, or our nation is lost.

Why do we present this drivel as though it were gospel? Why would people who SAY they won’t and don’t watch FNC any more, swallow this kind of WaPo swill and pass it on to others? Does WaPo really want to help Trump win? Do you ENJOY being brainwashed? Suckers!

By all accounts, this is not a proper election in a free republic. therefore she shouldn’t be recognized as president if she wins. Trump should NOT concede under any circumstances, IMHO Media collusion of this level makes it nearly impossible for the foe to win. Would expect this in Russia, not in the US.

There is NO 89 year old grandmother writing a moronic 4 page letter full of utter drivel! This is just another crap sandwich, turned out by the insane, far lefties, who have less than NO idea what’s what! Bless their hearts.



To: tcrlaf

The media is trying to carry out a coup. We are essentially living in Venezuela now. The idea that the democratically elected GOP nominee should withdraw because the Democrat controlled media doesn’t like him is a dangerous and unprecedented innovation- a direct attack on our democracy.

Yeah, there are lots of 89 y.o. folks even familiar with the word "tweeting" nevermind what it is.

This whole article is a lie and this "grandma" is a complete and utter fabrication.

Remember, he kicked WaPo off his plane and out of his events.

Tonight, the alphabet channels breathlessly reported “new polls” taken before Sunday’s debate showing Trump behind. On ABC’s Nightline, the large supportive crowd at Trump Tower over the weekend was called a protest. Never mind the happy faces. Hillary was flatly declared the debate winner. The report on the “fact-checkers” showed the zeal of the alleged checkers, who obviously want to catch Trump in what they can call a lie, as they lied about him blatantly throughout the broadcast.



To: dp0622

I agree. The elections for Putin and Chevez, while tainted in many ways, were much more fair and above board than this travesty of an “election.” This election is rigged. The rigged Democrat primary, the super delegates, the Soros orchestrated violence in the streets and in Trump’s rallies, the staggering media bias, the D+15 polls, the GOP sabotage, everything in this nightmare is without precedent and absolutely unacceptable. If Hillary “wins” this election the outcome is a fraud and I reject it. In a free and fair election Trump would be up 25 points against this crook. He may be, in truth, for all I know. If he wins he must clean house immediately. This election is shaping up to be the greatest political disaster in American history. And all because a man who was not part of “the club” wanted to Make America Great Again!

If you read the ‘letter’ what she says about “could easily lose” is about the only thing that WaPo quotes. The rest is supportive and topics/hints about what to hit Hillary with. There are other examples of people in the article who DO NOT say the same thing. There are even ones that show support in spite of the latest mud. The point is that Wapo only went for the cherry picked sound bite and took everything else out of context.



To: ntnychik; Mad_as_heck

I’ve tweeted trump many times not to concede under ANY circumstance no matter what may come of it. Or we will be a joke for letting a Soviet style election take place. “you speak treason!” “Fluently”

Not true. This is just more MSM propaganda and agitation to try to make it sound OK for Trump supporters to abandon him. Not going to happen. We are smarter than that. We can see right through them and see their agenda is to elect Hillary.

“This election is shaping up to be the greatest political disaster in American history. And all because a man who was not part of the club wanted to Make America Great Again!” I agree with everything you wrote, but your last paragraph bears repeating! Most everyone who’s part of the status quo is terrified that Donald Trump will be elected and shine some light on the real state of affairs. The government controls trillions of dollars. “Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.” Sadly our great nation has been infected by extreme corruption, and it is time for strong measures. It is up to each and every one of us to do everything we can to elect Donald Trump. He is really, in my opinion, our last hope to save this country. Trump/Pence 2016! Make America Great Again!

I agree completely. I have been strongly supporting Trump since before he even announced his candidacy. Strongly. I haven’t been as much for a candidate. Basically ever before. Trump is a very good candidate. He is for America. And Americans. I was going to say it has been one entire generation since any candidate has fired me up like Trump has. But I believe Trump is now ahead of even Reagan. He is EXACTLY what our country. He is exactly what our party needs. And i will be very, very proud to cast my vote for Donald Trump. And i will vote. 100 true. Best election ever.

...”Who owns the Washington Post? Even the New York Times, Guardian and NBC combined dont post as many negative stories about Trump.”... The owner is Jeff Bezos, owner of Amazon, which I love and use all the time. Now, I feel guilty every time I buy anything from there because he is one of the wealthiest men in the world and is using his wealth, through the Washington Post and his political views, to destroy the nation whose capitalistic system allowed him that good fortune. It is almost universally true of the newly rich that their instinct is to chop down the ladder of success once they have reached the top so that no one else can challenge their position there. That way they are viewed as “Gods.”



To: tcrlaf

Bullshit article complete with 89 year old concern troll with a so-called list of issues the democrats wish Trump would stop talking about.

Hillary AND the media will lead us into a nuclear war with Russia. Focus on that message and spread the word

Don’t buy ANYTHING from Amazon. It’s not that hard.

If Hillary wins, it will be because of voter fraud
