An investor monitors share market prices at a brokerage firm in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, August 24, 2015. — Reuters picKUALA LUMPUR, Aug 19 — Bursa Malaysia opened lower, weighed down by losses in Petronas-linked companies.

At 9.15am, the benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) was 1.37 points lower at 1,693.5, against yesterday’s close of 1,694.87 points.

It opened 1.65 points easier at 1,693.22 at 9am.

Gainers were slightly higher against losers, 168 to 118, on bargain hunting activity by retail investors in small-cap stocks, while 230 counters were unchanged, 1,173 untraded and 16 others suspended.

Among top gainers in the early session were Petronas Dagangan, down 38 sen to RM23.12, Petronas Gas declined 14 sen to RM22 and Petronas Chemicals fell six sen to RM6.60.

On the technical front, Kenanga Research said the FBM KLCI was still continuing its sideways trading pattern on the back of tapering key momentum indicators.

“With investors’ sentiment turning shaky as displayed by yesterday’s decline in most small-to-mid cap stocks, the benchmark index is likely to close the week on a muted tone.
