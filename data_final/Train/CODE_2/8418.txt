The Biggest Blunder of the 2016 Campaign

American Thinker ^ | October 11, 2016 | Steve McCann

Posted on by Kaslin

Many have tried to dismiss the recently released tapes of Donald Trump discussing women in extraordinarily vile terms as simply good old boy locker room banter claiming they are immaterial and will not impact on their vote. Perhaps to his diehard supporters they will not but that is not the target audience. The target audience is the womens vote, in particular suburban white women, who will, in the end determine the winner of the presidential election.

In 1920 American women were, for the first time, able to vote for president in all the states of the union. The female vote accounted for 30% of the total votes cast in that election. The womens vote gradually increased but remained below the 50% threshold until the election of 1964 when nearly 51% of the voting electorate were women. The female vote has exceeded the male vote ever since.

In fact, women have been the determining factor in five of the last six presidential elections. A phenomenon often referred to as the Gender Gap reflects the fact that women over the past 24 years tend to prefer the Democratic nominee and have created a voting gap from three to thirteen percentage points in favor of any Democratic Party nominee. In 2008 McCain won just 43% of the womens vote compared to 56% for Barack Obama, the worst result for a Republican to date. This long-term trend, in combination with a much higher turnout among female voters adds a significant layer of difficulty for any Republican not named Ronald Reagan (who won 58% of the womens vote in the 1984 landslide to win the presidency).

The female vs male turnout as a percent of the overall votes cast during the past five presidential elections are as follows:

Are we supposed to cry, gnash our teeth, and say “woe is me” over this article? Maybe there’s a strategy in posting these things but i’ll be damned if i know what it is. Hillary destroyed women’s lives and there’s so much to report from wikileaks that this just takes up space.

I disagree with the author’s contention that any other Republican nominee could have beaten her easily. I know she is a deeply flawed and disliked candidate, but the Clinton + Media coalition is powerful as we can see and would have taken practically anyone down, especially the GOPe favorite, Jeb.

To: Kaslin

We have to hope Trump also makes people to think twice about her. If not for him, stay home or vote 3rd. If people get disgusted and say I can’t vote for either one of them, it could impact the race.

To: Kaslin

If I could have advised Trump, I would have dug up 15 quotes from Hillary and Bill for Trump to memorize. They would have been quotes from her (exact quotes) when she was defending her husband from inappropriate behavior (or any behavior). I would have had Trump memorize them and be able to recall every one of them from memory. Then, after the initial apology and acknowledgement, I would have advise that he use the quote that most closely and generally provides a response. Even if the context is skewed or awkward. But never let on that he is actually quoting Hillary or Bill. Let the media dig and figure it out for themselves. They love to “discover” things and announce how smart they are. They would start reporting what Hillary once said about sexually aggressive behavior. After a few days, just to drive home the point, he would have to work in, “What difference does it make, at this point, anyway?” Then drop the mic and walk off.

The republican elites are still ticked off at the little people for going against what they told us to do. Usually we listen to them and take the crap they dish out so well: Dole, McCain, Romney. I’ll add GHWB and GWB as well, even though they won, because they may as well have been democrats.



To: rightwingintelligentsia

No one has taken Trump down! Isn’t this the same crap we saw in the primaries? We’re still out here, we’re still pissed, and we’re still voting.



To: Kaslin

Many women don't pick a President, they pick a husband. Judging by the divorce rate, they don't pick husbands very well either.

Every other ‘republican’ candidate would have rolled over and played dead immediately on nomination. Have to ‘be above the fray’ dontcha know. The GOPe has brought the Republican Party to the brink of extinction. An R House and Senate has DONE NOTHING to stop or reverse the Progressive Agenda. There is no reason to vote for the turncoats in the Republican Party. Ever again.

I disagree with the authors contention that any other Republican nominee could have beaten her easily. Exactly. Imagine: Cruz - Neanderthal Bible thumper. Rubio - closet gay (not a problem for Dems but we all know about the double standard). Christie - fat slob who killed people during Bridgegate. Carson - Uncle Tom who knows nothing about politics. The Democrat/media/government complex would destroy, or attempt to destroy Jesus himself.

I recently attended a week-long quilting retreat. 100 women, and all senior citizens. I heard worse there than what Trump said. If not for the media putting this as prime news, it would be a non-story. They just need to deflect anything that might come up about Hillary. Shameful.

Oh, and BTW, the biggest blunder in history was giving women the vote. And I’m one! ;-)

I'm hopeful that there are lot of women who don't speak out against the femnazi rhetoric, but don't agree with them. Real women know the difference between a guy who gets in bragadocious manly conversations and one who cheats. Normal people have a code, that what's said in those conversations stays there. They cringe at the thought of being recorded when they're talking about their guys and comparing notes. Summary.....I suspect that if it's done right between now and the election, he'll get more of those votes than he's polling. Perhaps the best person to get out there on the stump is Mrs. Pence.

To: Kaslin

Against virtually any other potential Republican candidate this overwhelming gender gap would have been virtually eliminated as a majority of women do not trust or like Hillary Clinton but their attitude toward Trump approaches loathing. I believe the author is absolutely wrong on two counts in this article: 1. Despite his strong negative ratings among women as far back as last spring, I remember that polls were consistently showing Trump performing better than any other Republican contenders against Hillary Clinton (and Bernie Sanders polling better than Clinton against Trump, for that matter). I mean, does the author really think Carly Fiorina would even be attracting the support of 30% of the voters if she had been the GOP nominee? 2. The track record of a male Republican candidate, and information that comes out about that candidate's past, have become increasingly irrelevant in an election because the Democratic campaigns will fabricate "woman" issues against any GOP contender anyway . This is where an in-your-face candidate like Donald Trump may have a better chance of winning than a simpering p#ssy like Mitt Romney. The author's own numbers seem to bear this out, or at least point to a flaw in his argument. Mitt Romney did slightly better among female voters in 2012 than George W. Bush did in 2000. Bush won, and Romney lost. More than anything else, this article tells me that Republican candidates simply have to get more men to vote in these elections. My question for the author is: Which Republican candidate in 2016 was most likely to attract more men?

“The target audience is the womens vote, in particular suburban white women” In other news, _50_Shades_of_Gray_ sold 80,000,000 books and $600,000,000 in theater tickets (not including video sales/rental). The story features a billionaire crudely objectifying women.

Women hate a man who wants them and makes a move. They really hate it when he kisses them without asking if they want a kiss and getting a release form signed. This is why 50 Shades of Gray sold 80 million copies in America and over 450 million worldwide. /s

The strategy is to support the faux moral posturing of the Bush/Romney wing of the party. Cruz is one of them, just ask Amanda Carpenter about “daddy Cruz”.

To: Kaslin

Women, or anyone else who finds the Trump tape the tipping point in their decision to vote against Trump, will be cutting off their nose to spite their face. If he loses they will live to rue that decision when the consequences of it come to bear in the form of world war, financial collapse, civil war/unrest/revolution, or who knows what other catastrophe. This country can’t absorb lib/progressive rule much longer before it disintegrates.

To: Kaslin

Nonsense, as is all of the “gender gap” analysis. Redo the calculation, and this time factor in that 0.90 x 12.8% of the female vote is black, and the only gender gap is a racial gap.

Trump IS the “centrist” candidate that the GOPee always claims it wants. Now these ‘tards are claiming to be Conservatives. It’s a joke.

There are definitely some women that should have never been allowed to vote. At the same time there are also some men that should have never been allowed to vote.



To: Kaslin

In 1920 American women were, for the first time, able to vote for president in all the states of the union. And I have read that their votes elected every Democrat since then.
