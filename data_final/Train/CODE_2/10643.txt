NEW DELHI: The Nifty50 closed below its crucial psychological support level of 8,700 during the week ended October 7 and it is important for the index to hold above the 8,663 level in the holiday-shortened week for the bulls to lead again on the Dalal Street On the other hand, if the index manages to close above the 8,730 level this week, the bulls could heave a sigh of relief and then look forward to scaling new highs around 8,750 and 8,780 levels.“Technically, with the Nifty50 correcting, traders will need to watch if the index can hold above the immediate support of 8,663. Else further declines are possible early next week. Nifty has the immediate resistance at 8,730,” said Vijay Singhania, Founder-Director, Trade Smart Online.“If the Nifty50 sustains below 8,720 and 8,730 levels in the first hour of trade on Monday, traders may see a downward move, which could take Nifty50 to the 8,680 level followed by 8,640 level,” he said.The index is likely to remain volatile but a lot of individual stocks are showing potential to outperform.Based on various brokerage recommendations, ETMarkets.com has collated a list of eight stock trading strategies for the next 5-21 trading sessions:After the recent strong move on the upside, the stock is in a consolidation pattern on its daily chart.
