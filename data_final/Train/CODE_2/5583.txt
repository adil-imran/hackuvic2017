This election is about Good vs. Pure Evil

US Defense Watch ^ | October 10, 2016 | Ray Starmann

Posted on by pboyington

The hand of God was on Mr. Trump last night.

Donald Trump walked on to the debate stage, savaged by the leftist mainstream media for his locker room remarks he made to Access Hollywood host, Billy Bush in 2005. Liberal and conservative pundits alike said Trump and his populist movement of deplorables was done. GOP hacks like Paul Ryan called for Trump to resign because he could never bounce back.

He did. Trump is back and hes got the Big MO again and he has goodness and the light shining right upon him.

Trump hammered Hillary Clinton on a myriad of subjects ranging from her pathological lying, her criminal private server activities, her corruption, her record of incompetence while Secretary of State, her call for open borders and endless, unvetted refugees, her host of Wall Street backers, her disdain for the middle class and of course, her husbands serial abuse of women and her participation in aiding and abetting his sexual crimes and peccadilloes.

Trump told Hillary if elected, hed call for a special prosecutor to investigate her national security crimes and hed personally throw her in the slammer.

Hillary was on the defense most of the night, glaring daggers back at Trump with her Caesar Romero Joker smile. After nearly 23 years of literally getting away with every crime imaginable, someone has finally called out the Clintons for what they are; criminals, predators and dark blackguards that have hijacked a political party, the White House and the country.

This election is about more than Democrats vs. Republicans, even more than about Globalism vs. Americanism; its about good vs. evil, the light vs. the dark, angels vs. demons.

Mr. Trump, while flawed like all men, represents the hopes and dreams and aspirations of millions and millions of Americans who have been left behind in the dust by the global elite who are destroying this nation. Have no doubt. Mr. Trump is on the side of the angels.

The Clintons are evil incarnate. There is more than ample evidence that both Bill and Hillary Clinton are more than your average liberals who want to raise taxes and confiscate your firearms.

Bill Clinton is a serial sexual predator who has been preying on women since he was Governor of Arkansas. With his undertaker charm and Boss Hogg corruption, he is the living embodiment of Elmer Gantrys evil doppelganger.

And, Mrs. Clinton is worse than her husband.

There are more than enough stories concerning Hillarys psychotic episodes as First Lady, as a Senator, as Secretary of State; stories about her using foul language, screaming for no reason, throwing objects, her sick rejoicing in the deaths of foreign leaders, her vicious disregard for other human beings, which is on a level that is tantamount with the behavior exhibited by sociopaths.

Her behavior could also be construed as that of someone who is either mentally ill or one who is under the influence of evil entities, or both.

I do not believe this is hyperbole. Hillary Clinton may very well be possessed.

Besides Hillarys own dark side, she is also a puppet of the globalists. She will do and say whatever the global elite want her to do, which is the continued rape of the United States of America through open borders, wretched trade deals, outsourcing, an inundation of Muslim refugees and the invention of a New Cold War to placate neocon maniacs who also serve the globalists.

In the next month, look for the globalists to pull out all the stops to try and destroy Trump. There will be more active measures undertaken by the Clinton campaign, their minions in the media, all funded by Soros and Buffett and the bankers in their dark towers of hate and greed. There will be more claims of things Trump said and did decades ago. There will be more contrived and rigged polls, and especially by CNN. There will be more faux outrage by Wolf Blitzer, Dana Bash and the newest fallen angel, Megyn Kelly. There will be more lies and deception, for that is all they have to run with.

The globalists will attempt to steal this election and if that fails, there is no limit to what they will do to stop Trump. They will collapse Deutsche Bank, start a war with Russia or go after Trump himself. They are desperate because they know their time is running out and an awakened populace is marching against them. Freedom and goodness are lining up against evil.

Trump is the voice for the nation, a nation that is disgusted with the sickening, anti-family, anti-American, anti-God, liberal agenda: open borders and unvetted Muslim refugees and diversity to the point of death for a country; the Marxist destruction of our schools, the poisoning of our churches with their twisted doctrine, the complete and utter annihilation of the US military from the greatest fighting force on earth to nothing more than an asylum for lackeys, cultural misfits and social engineers.

Trump has started a movement that simply cannot be stopped. The globalists cant destroy us all; although, no doubt, they will attempt to do so. We will take this country back and restore it to the rightful place it belongs as the City on the Hill no matter what we have to do. We will not allow this nation to be drawn and quartered by American traitors and foreign interests who wish to only line their pockets, while they destabilize the world and take down America as they hide out in gated communities on tropical atolls, while sycophants like House Speaker Paul Ryan are at their beck and call.

Be forewarned, Trump is only the beginning. If he is cheated out of the election, or if an uninformed populace believes the lies and ushers in a demon as President; or if God forbid, something else happens to him, the movement will continue. It will continue on Drudge, on Breitbart, on InfoWars and on a thousand and one other patriotic media outlets, large and small, known and unknown. It will continue in the towns and villages and cities of America. Trump has ignited a nation. There is nothing that will stop us.

As President Eisenhower remarked to Walter Cronkite on the 20th Anniversary of D-Day, Its a wonderful thing what those fellows were fighting for and sacrificing for, what they did to preserve our way of life. Not to conquer any territory, not for ambitions of our own. They did it so the world could be free. It just shows what free men will do rather than be slaves.

This nation is at a crossroads, perhaps not seen since the Revolution itself. Will we be slaves to domestic and foreign globalists who wish to destroy our way of life, or will we choose freedom over tyranny?

This election is about Good vs. Pure Evil.

Pray for Trump.

It is, but the movement will eventually be silenced and only carry on within us. A Hillary victory will be complete. Communications, logistics, and everything needed to keep it alive will be cut off and doing so will be legal. If she wins, it will mean America died with Scalia.



To: pboyington

I plan to do a nine-day novena for Trump. And on Election Day I’ll be holding up a Trump sign all day at a major polling place in a battleground state. This election is the last chance for America. The actions of Ryan and other GOP leaders has brought feelings in me I never knew existed. Only people who dont suffer enough from equality have the luxury of voting based on character. That will change over time. But by then it will be too late.

The Clintons are evil incarnate. True. William Jefferson Criminal and HIllaryous Rotten Criminal are the Greatest Crime Couple in the history of this fantastic republic. DEPOPULATE criminals, collectivists, Clintons, conmen, socialists, scumbags, liars, losers, tyrants, totalitarians from the body politic. It's easy to... live - free - republic

Well, no. It’s more like ordinary moral scruples (which are not necessarily that impressive before God) vs brazen wickedness. If Trump were “good”, which is to say a life mostly characterized by being actively virtuous and pious (and if you don’t think a rich man can be these then please consider a man after God’s own heart, His friend, and His servant ... or David, Abraham and Job respectively), then the left would be beside themselves that we had supported a “theocrat” and were seeking “theocracy” as prelude to them burning down whole cities if he won. There will probably be some destruction when he wins anyway. ... actually ... if they burn down certain college campuses that might do some good for the nation. Just saying....

Trump will win, because Trump is backed by God, because God is protecting America through him. And when he does, you will crawl back into your filthy hole and vanish.

This is not an election, it’s a revolution to stop the coup.



To: Talisker

Trump will win, because Trump is backed by God, because God is protecting America through him. Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition. In other words, we can and should trust in God, but we should simultaneously work on Trump's get out the vote efforts, donate to Trump's campaign, get trained as poll watchers . . . and prepare for catastrophe, just in case.

Two Kinds of Plunder I do not think that illegal plunder, such as theft or swindling  which the penal code defines, anticipates, and punishes  can be called socialism. It is not this kind of plunder that systematically threatens the foundations of society. Anyway, the war against this kind of plunder has not waited for the command of these gentlemen. The war against illegal plunder has been fought since the beginning of the world. Long before the Revolution of February 1848  long before the appearance even of socialism itself  France had provided police, judges, gendarmes, prisons, dungeons, and scaffolds for the purpose of fighting illegal plunder. The law itself conducts this war, and it is my wish and opinion that the law should always maintain this attitude toward plunder. The Law Defends Plunder But it does not always do this. Sometimes the law defends plunder and participates in it. Thus the beneficiaries are spared the shame, danger, and scruple which their acts would otherwise involve. Sometimes the law places the whole apparatus of judges, police, prisons, and gendarmes at the service of the plunderers, and treats the victim  when he defends himself  as a criminal. In short, there is a legal plunder... Socialism Is Legal Plunder You would use the law to oppose socialism? But it is upon the law that socialism itself relies. Socialists desire to practice legal plunder, not illegal plunder. Socialists, like all other monopolists, desire to make the law their own weapon. And when once the law is on the side of socialism, how can it be used against socialism? For when plunder is abetted by the law, it does not fear your courts, your gendarmes, and your prisons. Rather, it may call upon them for help. Legal Plunder Has Many Names Above all, if you wish to be strong, begin by rooting out every particle of socialism that may have crept into your legislation. “The Law” - Frederic Bastiat http://bastiat.org/en/the_law.html#SECTION_G019 William Jefferson Criminal and HIllaryous Rotten Criminal are the Greatest Crime Couple in the history of this fantastic republic. DEPOPULATE criminals, collectivists, Clintons, conmen, socialists, scumbags, liars, losers, tyrants, totalitarians from the body politic. It’s easy to... live - free - republic

Whoa there, hello to you to. Never said Hillary was GOING to win, just stating the obvious, that her winning would be a complete takeover of the country and any kind of resistance to her would be very difficult. I have faith in Trump, he came out swinging last night and landed one to the jaw. Glad to see the passion.

God used Samson, so why not Trump?



To: Talisker

Because this article is whistling past the graveyard when it talks about how the Trump movement (it’s not the Trump movement, it’s We The People and he stepped into the leadership) will carry on if Hillary wins. I take no solace in that. The SCOTUS will be lost and our corrupt Congressmen are working against us. I’m not going to cross my fingers and hope for midterms or a 2020 comeback. I’m treating this like there is no tomorrow if Trump doesn’t win. THIS is the fight, THIS election is the thin red line.



To: Mjreagan

Agreed. Well said.
