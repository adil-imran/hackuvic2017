RINOs are blowing up the Republican Party Not Trump

Canada Free Press ^ | 10/11/16 | Sher Zieve

Look to Venezuela for your future under Hillary. As it is, under Obama we're almost there. And...Hillary will provide the final solution

If ever there was proof that the establishment (aka leftist) members of the Republican Party are working with the Clinton Campaign, their faux horror over the Donald Trump male locker-room talk and huffy holier-than-thou departure from supporting him is the kicker either that or theyve not been around actual men much. They are the ones dividing and destroying the Republican Party. Not Trump. And, it most certainly seems that all of the GOPers (those who had already expressed their disdain and even hatred for Trump for example Carly Fiorina supporting him for a couple of weeks? Give us a break! Her support was at its best disingenuous) all pretty much ran loudly away from him and told the respective media players at almost the same precise time. Were they cued as to the time of attack? Was all of this coordinated by Bill Kristol, Mitt Romney anddare I say his/its nameGeorge Soros? Who knows? But, to me and at this juncture it certainly seems extremely plausible.

RINOs = Democrat Operatives And they are a bunch of them,

This is really all about protecting their 30 year bipartisan policy of non-enforcement of immigration laws and borders. The illegal alien inundation was intentional. Trump threatens the Cheap Labor Express.

I think that in 2008 after the bank bail out, the US chamber of commerce had a thought, “We don’t need the GOP, the rats will give us free money.” K Street responded by throwing dollars at the GOPe. GOPe’s the money whores of the system gladly took the money. IMHO, it is over. We have 3 weeks to buy that gun, ammo and all you need for the end of the US as we knew it. thank you.

I see this as the death spiral of the GOP, not of Donald Trump. The GOP had two chances to knock out Barack Obama, a lamentable failure (this could have been foreseen in 2008 and was known by 2012). They failed both times because they refused to confront real issues and presented themselves as whitewashed versions of the uniparty. The voters were less than thrilled and more than a few just stayed home. Donald Trump may win or lose, but he is a vast improvement on both the preceding candidates. He stands for something that is a real alternative, and is not afraid to speak truth to power (in this case, power is the globalist elites in government, media and academia). If the GOP emerges from this election wounded and bloodied, then a replacement will emerge and it will be in the Donald Trump tradition. They have lost this confrontation with Trump already and the election results will only determine the nature of the process that will follow. If he wins, the death blow will be fast and effective. If he loses, they will totter on for months, perhaps years, but the majority of their base will desert them for whatever new party declares itself to be anti-globalist. That is the key here, the Republicans can only remain relevant if they are declared anti-globalists, like three quarters of their support base.

All of the Democrats in R jerseys need to be removed from office even if it takes voting for Democrats in D jerseys for one election cycle.

The Kenyanesian Usurpation was brought to you by BOTH parties. The Constitution says natural born citizen.

That means one who is naturally an American because they couldnt be anything else, born here of citizen parents.

Everyone in DC wanted that changed without the hassle of amending the Constitution.

The Senate passed a resolution declaring McCain a natural born citizen because he had TWO citizen parents, even though he was born in Panama.

Then Obama runs and wins based on just being born here, even though he told us on his website he was born a British subject.

So the standard went from born here of citizen parents to just TWO citizen parents to just being born here in one election cycle without amending the Constitution.

This was done intentionally because Rubio (no citizen parents), Cruz (foreign birth, one citizen parent), Jindal (no citizen parents), and Haley (no citizen parents) were all ineligible and the future of the GOP. The truth of the Kenyanesian Usurpation will never see the light of day because they all cooperated in the violation of the Constitution.

It’s the Two-Party system that needs to be blown up. Where did it say in the Constitution that there had to be only two parties. But our government has implemented a system where pretty much it’s almost impossible to undo the Two-Party system. The only difference between the US and the Soviet Union, is that the Soviet sanctioned one party, whereas we sanction two. And like Three Dog Night sang, “Two can be as bad as one.”

I am not a Republican. I am a conservative. If I can't rely on Republicans to promote a conservative agenda, then I'll vote for someone else. It's really that simple.

After President Trump takes office in January, for the RINOcrats who betrayed the Republican Party, the price to have access to the Executive Branch should be the loss of seniority or one of their testicles. That will lessen the probability of them being turncoats in the 2000 elections.



To: Sean_Anthony

Look at all the RINO’s that rolled over for 0bama and Polosi and just about every Democrat rat ....

Freedom Party, Constitution, Libertarian. What’s left if we lose other than a frayed base? 2018 would put all gop seats at risk if a big chunk of the gop’ers walk.

To: SkyDancer

My sentiments exactly. Why should we care what Ryan and the other Republicans in power want? We gave them the House and the Senate and we could hardly be worse off if those had been in Democrat’s hands anyway. WHY BOTHER, MR RYAN?? I have seen memes that point out how many Congressmen, Senators, Governors, etc, are REPUBLICAN and how can we (Republicans) complain?? They don’t add that the R’s all over the country, just roll over for the Dems. WHY BOTHER TO VOTE REPUBLICAN, WHEN THOSE WE ELECT ALWAYS ALLOW THE DEM AGENDA TO PREVAIL???

Are they really losing their shit over locker room comments? Bunch of hypocrites. What, they never at least thought these thoughts are talked like this. Cowards.



To: Sam Gamgee

Exactly , cowards never win...



To: Sean_Anthony

Win or lose, what’s left of the GOPe party will go into the history books as a failed political party in the tradition of the Bull Moose Party. There is no future there, only the Democrat Lite cowardliness that conservatives should have rebelled against a decade ago.

I just returned from visiting my 80 year old politically active aunt from Michigan. She has been very very very active in the Republican Party of Michigan for decades. She agrees ... Republicans that don’t support trump should be voted against until they are all gone for the sake of the next generation. It’s too late for unemployed baby boomers that have lost everything. She hopes that this change election can begin to stop the bleeding for her grandchildren
