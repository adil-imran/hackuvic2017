A General Assembly of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the South West zone converged on Ibadan, Oyo State capital, yesterday, for a peace parley that would resolve the crisis between Senator Ahmed Makarfi and Senator Ali Modu Sheriff.

They resolved to restore an enduring harmony in the camps of the two senators over the fate of the PDP.

The meeting, which had as its theme: “Working together to regenerate our party in line with the spirit of the founding fathers” was presided over by a former Deputy National Chairman of the party, Chief Shuaib Oyedokun, and it had in attendance party chieftains drawn from different states of the South West. They include a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dimeji Bankole; a former Leader of the Senate, Senator Teslim Folarin; a former Minister of Sports, Professor Taoheed Adedoja; a former Minister of Education, Professor Tunde Adeniran; Barr. Jimoh Ibrahim, Senator Sunday Fajimi, Senator Buruji Kashamu and a host of other party leaders.At the end of the five-hour meeting, a peace committee was set up to look into all intra-party fractions with a view to bringing in all aggrieved members to a round table.In a communiqué issued and read out to newsmen by Professor Adedoja, the forum applauded the on-going peace moves at the federal level by the Sheriff and Makarfi groups while urging all other zones in the country to resolve their internal grievances accordingly.Specifically, all party leaders in attendance resolved to remain within the PDP, irrespective of the various challenges facing the party at the national, zonal and state levels, with the aim of capturing the centre come 2019.However, the forum admonished the leadership of the PDP to clearly zone the party’s chairmanship position to the South West “being the only zone that had never occupied the position in the past.”The forum also urged the PDP leadership in Ondo State to close ranks and work together as a solid and united team to sustain the control of the state by the party at the forthcoming governorship election in the state.
