Denied: Oklahomas request for Real ID Act extension denied

kfor.com ^ | 10/11/16 | kfor

Posted on by ColdOne

Beginning on Jan. 30, 2017, federal agencies are prohibited from accepting drivers licenses and identification cards that were issued by non-compliant states for official purposes.

In other words, if you do not have a form of identification that complies with the Real ID Act, you will not be allowed to enter a federal building, facility, military base or courthouse.

Beginning on Jan. 22, 2018, a drivers license or state ID from a state that is not compliant with the Real ID Act will not be accepted to board a commercial aircraft within the United States.

Real ID for citizens. But terrorists need not carry cumbersome IDs.

Clearly we see what matters most to the bureaucrats.

Can I ask a stupid question? Why does any of this matter? Now that a number of states are giving drivers licenses to illegal aliens, you figure that any state issued ID can no longer be considered proof of citizenship. What good does it do, even if states have tightened up standards for issuing ID, if illegals can get the same ID you and I have??? What does it prove?? And would tighter ID standards prevent terrorism or another 9/11?? I assume foreigners such as Mohammed Atta and his boys used their foreign passports as their ID.



To: ColdOne

This applies to voting then, correct? /sarc



To: ColdOne

“you will not be allowed to enter a federal building, facility, military base or courthouse.” At least I can still vote...



To: ColdOne

Just happened to KY as well. I think our governor is basically telling the feds to pound sand. I really like Bevin. I’ll use my passport if I need it.

What if you are subpoenaed to go to federal court but your state isn’t in compliance ????



To: Dilbert San Diego

Not stupid question. I think this is also about more money for the gov. Passports are pricey now. They get the money. It also looks like you will also have to buy a drivers license to drive too.

What if you’re arrested by the Feds? Gee, do I not have to go to trial because it would be in a Federal Courthouse???

To: ColdOne

Really no big deal. You need to prove identity, citizenship (or proof you are lawfully in the US), address, etc. Freepers should be all in favor of this since illegals won’t be able to get this kind of ID which means they can’t enter government buildings, drive a car, or fly.

OK. Where is the list of non compliant states?



To: Dilbert San Diego; All

Yep. What if I am called to jury duty and have no passport? Will the judge issue a warrant for me? Will I be allowed in jail without a passport?

At least I can still vote... yeah, and as much as you want

Illegals won’t need this. Illegals will be exempt more than likely. They get all the perks from teamobama now. They won’t need papers. They won’t need them to vote either. IMHO

Hey, the Democrats said this violated our fundamental civil rights.

You are assuming that people want to vote. This country's voting history/record is deplorable. We simply don't care who wins while we are fat and happy. Are we spoiled rotten or what?



To: ColdOne

Except for voting in Federal elections. Then it’s just come as you are and we’ll take your word for it.

Dark = In compliance

Medium = Granted extension

Light = Noncompliant



To: ColdOne

Then no vote without one.



To: ColdOne

But you can vote without any id. Stupid

“Now that a number of states are giving drivers licenses to illegal aliens, you figure that any state issued ID can no longer be considered proof of citizenship.” Well, although it pains me that California is giving illegals DL’s, they one’s they get are different than the one’s issued to citizens. They allow the illegals to drive “legally,” but they are not an ID.



To: Dilbert San Diego

What good does it do, even if states have tightened up standards for issuing ID, if illegals can get the same ID you and I have??? Moves citizens toward national ID that will control more and more aspects of their lives and makes them easier to track.

Just wait until they require us to be RFID-chipped.

Democrats will give Federal Real IDs to all 3rd World nations. US State id’s will be banned. Open world voting in US elections. Good is bad, bad is good.



by 39 posted onby TheNext (Hillary Hurts Children & Women)

This is racist, because democrats keep telling us that black people have no agency, and are too stupid to get an ID, so they will be denied all government services, including being able to work for the government.

Get Out The Vote

To: Nifster

Get Out the Vote? I could hack a voting machine that generates 10,000 opposing votes for each vote you cast. There are no open, public registration controls on vote machines. Conservatives have been sleeping for 20 years now both parties may doom your vote. We will all have proof the election was rigged, but Hillary could be in power for the next 8 years. Trump & Sons will have the people’s support. But, Prepare yourself

If we swamp the vote even the isolated hackers won’t change the outcome Get Out The Vote Brexit proves the point

To: Nifster

“Isolated Hackers?” All of South America is rigged. The parties rig it. Electronic scales to infinity. What are you not hearing? 1 vote vs 10, 10 million, 1 billion Rigged machines in all critical counties, disabled.

1 machine enabled and election is over.

To: Nifster

Brexit has vote protection by pre counting. USA has none, like banning voter id, to enable rigging.

Getting a driver’s license is a sore subject in our family right now. Trying to get learner’s permit for grandson in Texas has turned out to be a huge ordeal. High schools no longer have driver’s ed. There are, however, four driving schools he can attend and pay lots of money to in our very small city. Son and grandson made three trips to DPS and $160 later he has his permit in hand. Son has his folder containing checklist to document grandson’s driving. Took him on his last trip to take his computer test. Never have seen such a disorganized mess in my whole life. Thought Texas was better than that So looks like no more discount on auto insurance for having taken driver’s ed. Driving schools must have a lot of people lobbying our Legislature. We renewed our passports several years ago and will make sure they do not expire. Don’t want to start all over again.
