New and highly prospective 7.5km long "King Col" Pegmatite Trend located at De Grey's 100% owned Turner River, within a world class lithium-tantalum province.

Limited reconnaissance rock chip sampling completed to date. Detailed rock chip sampling to commence immediately.

Nine samples (out of total of 38 only) with lithium oxide (Li 2 O) assays ranging from 0.15% to 4.22% over ~1.5km strike length

Prospective for Lithium-Caesium-Tantalum (LST) style pegmatite hosted mineralization

Anomalous rock chip results include: Tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) to 221.6ppm Caesium (Cs) to 1605ppm Niobium (Nb) to 146ppm Rubidium (Rb) to 8420ppm (0.84%) Beryllium (Be) to 23800ppm (2.38%)

Lepidolite (lithium bearing mineral) identified within anomalous lithium zone

No modern pegmatite exploration known along this new pegmatite trend

Reconnaissance sampling across the Turner River tenements is ongoing

Turner River - Unlocking Shareholder Value

De Grey Mining Ltd (ASX: DEG, "De Grey", "Company") is pleased to advise that high grade lithium and additional highly anomalous results have been defined in recent surface reconnaissance rock chip samples within De Grey's 100% owned tenement E45/2533 at the Turner River Project. The Project is located only 40km from the world class Pilgangoora Lithium-Tantalum Project and 20km from the Tabba Tabba Tantalum Mine (Figure 1).

The rock chip sampling programme was undertaken along a newly discovered 7.5km long zone (Figure 2) of relatively sparsely outcropping pegmatites. The new pegmatite trend, named the King Col Pegmatite Trend, is considered to be highly prospective as the zone is:

identified lithium bearing mineral - lepidolite

anomalous lithium occurs over 1.5km zone

anomalous LCT indicator elements over 7.5km strike length

occurs within the Tabba Tabba greenstone rocks

The pegmatite outcrops are generally very low lying, small to patchy outcrops with intervening areas of aeolian sand, soil and large areas of quartz scree. Mapping of the individual pegmatites is quite difficult due to the lack of continuous outcrop and surficial scree and sands. However, in many instances the individual pegmatites are interpreted to have potential widths ranging from a few metres up to 50m. The patchy outcrops of pegmatite continue over a 7.5km strike length within greenstone rocks (mafic to ultramafic rocks) of the Tabba Tabba Greenstone Belt.

Sampling at the southern end of the King Col Pegmatite Trend has highlighted a 1.5km long zone of anomalous lithium and identification of the lithium bearing mineral lepidolite (Figure 3) from a historical (unmapped) small prospecting pit. Further sampling and mineral investigations are required to determine if any other lithium bearing minerals are present along this trend.

The rock chip sampling results are considered very encouraging, considering the limited nature of this initial first pass reconnaissance sampling programme. The results include a peak of

associated with a small outcrop of the lithium bearing mineral - lepidolite, and an additional 8 samples ranging from

2

along a zone of 1.5km.

The entire 7.5km pegmatite trend, is associated with anomalous LCT pegmatite elements include Tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) to 221.6ppm, Caesium (Cs) to 1605ppm, Niobium (Nb) to 8420ppm (0.84%), Rubidium (Rb) to 8420ppm (0.84%), Beryllium (Be) to 23800ppm (2.38%). Table 1 provides results of selected LCT associated elements.

As a comparison, the nearby world class Pilgangoora Lithium and Tantalum deposit, owned by Pilbara Minerals Limited, and occurs in pegmatites over a 9km long strike length with a resource stated as 128.6Mt @ 1.22% Li2O and 138ppm Ta2O5 (Pilbara Minerals Limited ASX release, dated 22 Aug 2016). The Pilgangoora pegmatites also are hosted by similar greenstone rocks as seen at the King Col Pegmatite Trend.

A follow-up program of detailed rock chip and soil sampling programme is currently being planned and is expected to commence during October, with the direct aim of defining anomalous target zones for subsequent drill testing. Reconnaissance sampling across the Turner River Project tenements is ongoing.
