France Shuts Down Mosques, Bans Foreign Funders

France has shut down at least 20 mosques and now has banned foreign funding of the Islamic houses of worship as well.

At least 20 of the 120 Salafi mosques in the country have been shut down in France since December 2015.

But in the wake of a third radical Islamist terror attack, last month Prime Minister Manuel Valls called for a ban on foreign funding on Islamic mosques altogether. Nor would Valls say how long that ban would last.

A few days later, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve met with Muslim leaders about the ban, and explained it was time to put an end to incitement once and for all.

Speaking with reporters after the meeting, Cazeneuve was quoted by The Washington Post as saying, There is no place in France for those who call for and incite hatred in prayer halls or in mosques.

French Muslims are deeply concerned that government officials will tag their community as being friendly to terrorists. Marwan Muhammad, the director of the Collective Against Islamophobia in France, told The Post, It gives the idea that mosques have something to do with terrorism.

All told, at present there are more than two thousand mosques in France.

In 2002 a book on "the American Mosque" appeared.[5] The overall number of mosques in the United States quietly rose from 1,209 in 2000 to 2,106 in 2010, an increase of 74% ( well before Obama started importing them in droves). The 9/11-triumphant "Ground Zero mosque", a planned mosque in lower Manhattan, was the subject of controversy from 2010 on. In September 2011, a temporary 4,000-square-foot (370 m2) Islamic center opened in renovated space at the site,[7] and current plans are for a museum to be built, instead of a mosque. A 2011 study, The American Mosque 2011, sponsored by the Hartford Institute for Religion Research (Hartford Seminary), the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies, as well as the nation's largest Islamic civic and religious groups, including the Islamic Society of North America and the Council on American-Islamic Relations, found that the U.S. States with the most mosques were New York (257), California (246) and Texas (166).[6] Through 2014, a building boom for mosques has been going on.[8] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mosques_in_the_United_States

France is going after the imams and the financing. This is when thing get really dicey. They are the root cause of the violence. The imams will lose money and power. This mafia like religion will fight back. Because Imams Money Matters. France is fighting a crime family that they invited in and promoted.

It gives the idea that mosques have something to do with terrorism. That very idea is self evident in the very words and deeds of your followers.

We should do the same here. Any money supporting mosques in America comes from the Saudi Wahhabi pigs and their dependent oil states in the gulf. Now that they can’t shovel that money to France, they will have more to pour into America and poison our society.

It may be decades before we in the US show even as much realism about Islamic radicalism as France is now forced to show.

Ask any moslem, and they will tell you: “Islam isn’t merely another “religion”. It is a way of life, a political system, a holistic gestalt and world view that covers lifestyle, politics, clothing, family life, marriage, even personal hygiene. There is NO “separation of church and state”, no “freedom of religion” and no “choice”. In the moslem worldview, Islamic countries are called “Dar al Islam’ (House of Peace) and non-islamic countries are called “Dar al Hab” (House of War). They consider ALL moslems to be part of the “Ummah” (The Moslem World), and thus NOT part of the country in which they live. This is not bigoted talk...this is their belief system. Moslems who DON’T believe these things are considered apostate or backslidden. Therefore, governments should NOT use the measuring rod of “Religion” in governing those among them who are moslem. It is not a racial thing, nor a religious thing. It is a POLITICAL thing, much like nazism and communism, both of which demand complete allegiance to the group, at the expense of all other loyalties. Islam’s leaders have been quite clear about the “disconnect” between their system and ours, between the koran and the Constitution, between the Western Worldview and the ummah. They have come right out and stated their goals, and they are NOT ours. Why don’t we BELIEVE them???? (All spelling and capitalization “errors” are intentional)

Gee, ya think France has finally realized that muslims are not their friends?

Salafists are, by definition, violent and virulent. Salafists are Muslim fundamentalists.

Back to basics types, who want to practice the religion the way Muhammad did, and the way the Caliphs immediately following Muhammad did. Wahhabis are a good example of Muslim fundamentalists.

They will kill other Muslims who alter Muhammad's beliefs and practices as quick as they will kill us Infidels.

That's why so many so-called Muslim heretics get killed by Salafists. IMHO, unfortunately for us Infidels, the Salafists have the correct interpretation of Islam as layed out in the Koran and Hadiths, and as interpreted and practiced by Muhammad. -Tom

True. Glick analyzed al-Qaradawi’s speeches/messages and noticed that he’s arguing for a combination of Salafism and Wahabbism. This piece was from the time of the Arab Spring.

I hate seeing such weakness. Do what needs to be done now. (repatriation, going back a generation or two) or it will be much more painful. War will sort it out. Only two options. Everything else is just prolonging the agony.

To: combat_boots

True.

Glick analyzed al-Qaradawis speeches/messages and noticed that hes arguing for a combination of Salafism and Wahabbism. ISIS is basically a combination of Salafism and Wahhabism. The Salafist influence works against Saudi Arabia because the Wahabbis respect Saudi Kings as being legitimate.

ISIS does not agree with that point and therefore poses a threat to Saudi Arabia's ruling class. Things are very complicated in Muslim infighting.

One of the things they do agree on, is they should be killing us Kafirs who won't convert to Islam. -Tom

“ISIS is basically a combination of Salafism and Wahhabism.” Exactly. And, this merger is tightening. Scares the $hit out of me. Why is it only we few understand this, here on FR and in some other, conservative places? There is no way to kill people that these monsters will not use. Disemboweling people right there on the concert hall floor in Paris, boiling people in hot tar, slicing off genitals and raping to death, beheading, and on and on. They understand total war in a medieval sense. And our so-called leaders won’t even name the enemy. Meanwhile, Shia and Sunna kill each other with abandon and destroy Christians and others en masse. 0bama/State/UN is bringing them HERE. If we do not stop this, we shall be overrun.

Why is it only we few understand this, here on FR and in some other, conservative places? I believe it is because of our leaders, political, military and religious don't want to face the unsettling facts about Islam.

That keeps us shallow Americans off guard and unable to fathom Islam. Most of us have a Christian mamby pamby girlyboy outlook on life and can't believe anyone could look at life and salvation so differently from us, as the Muslims do. Rather then take forceful action against Muslims , Christian thinking will avoid action against Muslims and replace it with prayers. We try to make Islam conform to our version of what supernatural beings, and religion is all about.

Muslims believe differently, and have taken advantage of our naiveness for 1400 years. -Tom

If you say, “Nuke Mecca”, ISIS would agree.
