This was the best politically spent $100,000 in US history..? Alex Jones is a clown, sure, but this was pure genius, I gotta hand him that.



To: Beautiful_Gracious_Skies

Even if ZERO cameras show the shirt it forces her into a voice tone that makes her sound HORRIBLE. Which is what she IS.



To: gaijin

Pure genius, I agree. I think that it is helping get the message across to unknowing people.



To: gaijin

Why is he a clown?

I swear that I just saw a Lewinsky ‘look-alike’ on live TV. Maybe in Virginia. Now that would be fun to play dress up wherever Bill speaks for the next 3 weeks. Black Wig, Blue dress, and so on.

I guess it is getting close to Hallowe’en, the witches and worlocks are all gathering and chanting their magic incantations, “save the earth,” “stronger together,” and “I did not have sex with that woman.” She just had sex with me. I guess.

Al Gore looks ancient. No crime getting older. I am too. I was just taken aback by his total lack of color and tone.

So glad to see the protests spreading, if not following her.



To: Beautiful_Gracious_Skies

The irony in this is delicious. The Left has always has had an arrogant attitude it owns guerrilla theater and agitprop. They hate like hell when someone copies their playbook. That’s when the start calling it ‘’hate’’. Seriously through I have a very disquieting feeling the Old Slag is going to end up in The White House.

A more relevant chant would be “Hillary is a rape enabler” or equivalent since it is Hillary Clinton - not Bill Clinton - who is running for President.



To: ColdOne

.”....you could see she didnt have that many people at her rally.” That is the real untold story here. The “Bill is a rapist” fad is at least getting some people to show up to Hillary’s rallies. Her campaign is probably secretly grateful for this.

HA!

This should be captioned: “Mrs. Clinton, please put on a Burka, you are scaring the $hit out of our camels!” BTW, who is the guy second from the left with the “gold clanger” in his waistband, or is that his dagger? The guy with the Angel Food Cake Mold for a hat.

I enjoy watching Alex Jones you tube channel. He has some very interesting guests and insight.

That’s true?! That’s that guy..?!



To: gaijin

I’m no info wars fan but he’s been giving Matt Bracken a forum lately and for that I’m glad.

At the beginning of her speech, she was claiming an overflow crowd, she said it at least twice. Another pants on fire moment.

Hmmm...is that Corey Lewandowski at the far right of the frame? In all seriousness, it’s great to see kids doing the job Senate Republicans should have done 20 years ago.

I think 5 words gets it done just fine. But whatever it is should describe the Hildebeast and not her husband. (I did like Man Bear Pig BTW. It has a nice ring to it).

http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2010/06/gore-pleaded-with-masseuse-to-release-his-second-chakra/ Al Gore Pleaded With Masseuse to “Release His Second Chakra” Jim Hoft Jun 29th, 2010 After a long days work, the junk scientist needed some hot second chakra action.

Byron York at The Washington Examiner reported, via Ace: The police report of the masseuses complaint is 73 pages long and extremely detailed. According to the document, she got a call from the front desk of the trendy Hotel Lucia on the night of Oct. 24, 2006. The hotel had a special guest. Could she come at 10:30 p.m.? She went to Gores room carrying a folding massage table and other equipment. Gore, whom she had never met, greeted her with a warm embrace. The hug went on a bit long, and I was taken just a bit aback by it, the masseuse told police. But she went along because Gore was a VIP and a powerful individual and the Hotel Lucia had made it clear to me by inference that they were giving him the royal treatment.’ Gore said he was tired from travel and described in detail the massage he wanted. It included work on the adductor muscles, which are on the inside of the thighs. I mentally noted that a request for adductor work is a bit unusual, the masseuse told police, because it can be a precursor to inappropriate behavior by a male client. Gore also requested work on his abdomen. When that began, He became somewhat vocal with muffled moans, etc., the masseuse recounted. Gore then demand[ed] that I go lower. When she remained focused on a safe, nonsexual area, Gore grew angry, becoming verbally sharp and loud. The masseuse asked Gore what he wanted. He grabbed my right hand, shoved it down under the sheet to his pubic hair area, my fingers brushing against his penis, she recalled, and said to me, There! in a very sharp, loud, angry-sounding tone. When she pulled back, Gore angrily raged and bellowed at her. Then, abruptly, the former vice president changed tone. It was as though he had very suddenly switched personalities, she recalled, and began in a pleading tone, pleading for release of his second chakra there.



To: Beautiful_Gracious_Skies

I don’t know why his stuff isn’t allowed. I have found much information there that turns up later in other news sources. This is also true with Lew Rockwell’s site, and also the truthfeed site is a good one that is not allowed. But it is not our site and we don’t make the rules, so we must respect the owner’s wishes.



To: SirLurkedalot

Ya know? You’re right. For THAT I am extremely grateful. I did think AJ interrupted Bracken excessively, but...he does that to all. I’m not sure if that makes it better or worse. But I am relieved that FINALLY, SOMEONE gave Matt, whose books are THE BEST, a break. Took freakin long enough..!



To: mrsmith

Yea baby, shout it out. pOTUS is laughing. Please post the video coverage, or better yet, start a new thread with this gal.



To: gaijin

Why no infowars here?



To: Travis McGee

And she will never defend where her $$$ has come from... Do that...and she will disappear.



To: lee martell

With the threat of criminal prosecution for sexual assault hanging over the pervs head no wonder he’s looking older. And that reminds me. I see the Press is treating his attendance at her rally and the cloud of the allegations of sexual assault over his head (the serial massage abuser) the same way they do with the serial rapist - silence.



To: gaijin

He’s no more a clown then every single member of the MSM. In fact, because of his big support for Trump, a lot less.
