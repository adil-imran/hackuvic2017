CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S REVIEW

During my first year as CEO I set out LiDCO's plans to drive international expansion whilst maintaining our market leading position in our home market. This set of results and the actions put in place during the period show us starting to deliver on those plans to fully realisethe opportunities for LiDCO technology globally.

With the challenging environment of the NHS, I am very pleased with our results in the UK which provide us with a solid base from which to expand. We have seen the capital buying process lengthen but the fundamental flow of recurring disposable revenue grew. This enables us to make further investments in our commercial activities abroad.

The USA is the largest and fastest growing market for hemodynamic monitoring as a result of increased adoption of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ('ERAS') and Perioperative Surgical Home ('PSH') programmes. This has been reflected in our results, a 37% revenue growth versus the comparative period. As part of our investment programme we have added to our US commercial team and plan to continue to do so in order to exploit this substantial opportunity.

Outside of our direct markets of the UK and US we continue to prioritise opportunities as we seek to build sustainable repeatable businesses. The rate of adoption of hemodynamic monitoring varies greatly across the world, and our aim is to build a number one or two position in target countries.

We continue to build on a foundation of strong technology and product development. So far this year we have seen a number of independent clinical trials published reporting improved patient outcomes when using LiDCO technology in cardiac, caesarian, oncology, abdominal and orthopaedic surgery and have launched the LiDCOunitymonitor offering non-invasive, minimally invasive and calibrated solutions with one disposable.

Financial Results

Overall revenues were up £170,000 to £3.77m (2015: £3.60m) with LiDCO product revenues up 10% to £3.03m (2015: £2.76m).

Gross profit increased 6% overall to £2.52m (2015: £2.37m), although the gross profit margin on LiDCO product sales decreased from 80% to 78%, largely the effect of product mix. Excluding the exceptional costs in the comparative period, administrative costs decreased by 3% to £2.87m (2015: £2.95m) as we managed our expenses to allow re-allocation of resources to commercially focused activities. Net cash inflow from operating activities in the period was £856,000 (2015: £315,000) resulting from reductions in debtors and the planned reduction in inventory. Regarding product development activities, during the period we continued to invest in the next generation of LiDCO products and continued development of the LiDCO unity product for which we obtained registration in March 2016 . Total expenditure on product development during the period was £203,000 and expenditure in the second half is expected to be about £250,000 compared with total development costs in the prior year of £419,000. Net cash inflow was £498,000 (2015: net cash outflow £124,000).

Cash balances at 31 July 2016 amounted to £2.09m (31 January 2016: £1.59m). The Company has no borrowings.

Operational Review

Exports increased to 43% (2015: 38%) of sales of LiDCO products and this shift is in line with our stated intention to grow our export sales as a percentage of total sales from our leading position in our home market.

Our strongest growth came from the USA where the adoption of hemodynamic monitoring is gaining significant pace. Our revenues grew 37% driven by strong capital sales as we won new customer business and expanded our commercial reach by signing a distribution agreement with ICU Medical. Royalties from the ICU Medical Cogent monitor are expected in the 2017/18 financial year. However, with an increasingly competitive environment, overall disposable sales declined as we concentrated on increasing sales of monitors to new customer accounts. Excluding the loss of a significant customer smartcard units grew by 2%.. With the market opportunities developing, we have added to our direct sales team this year and plan to continue to do so as well as using strategic relationships to promote the technology. One driver for this investment is the five year purchasing agreement covering 38 hospitals which we signed in 2015. This has begun to contribute to our growth as we convert the individual hospitals to our technology.

Sales in the UK (excluding third party products) were £1.72m (2015: £1.71m). This level performance is attributable to delayed purchases of monitors as we experience elongated capital expenditure approval processes. We expect to realise these delayed sales in the second half of this financial year. Despite this, recurring disposable revenue grew with units up 13% to 16,590 (2015: 14,660), making LiDCO the clear market leader in the UK.

In the UK we saw an anticipated decline of our lower margin third party products sales to £0.75m (2015: £0.84m) largely due to increased pricing pressure.

In the first six months we recommenced sales of monitors to our Japanese partners and continued the trend of disposables sales that LiDCO experienced at the end of last financial year. In-market sales continued to make progress and we recently launched the non-invasive version of our product. However to increase traction in this large mature hemodynamic market we are seeking additional distribution activities.

During the period we signed master distribution agreements with LOK Corporation covering a number of territories across the Sub-Saharan African and Canada. These agreements are a further extension of the Company's approach to global marketing and distribution management. We have also signed new distribution contracts in Saudi Arabia and Singapore, allowing LiDCO to benefit from hemodynamic monitoring being adopted globally.

Sales to distributors whether in Rest of World (ROW) or in Europe were collectively in-line with internal expectations with area fluctuations due to timing. As experienced by many other medical device manufacturers we have been subject to lengthy delays in registering our products in China. However having received clearance earlier this year we have high expectations of this growing market as it starts to adopt hemodynamic monitoring. Significant growth is expected from our distribution markets in the second half of the year.

Further details of the Company's performance, in terms of revenues and unit sales by key geographies, are given in the tables below:

Strategic plans going forward

I laid out the strategic plans in the annual report for 2015/16 and these remain fundamentally unchanged. The strength of our business model and future success of this business lies in increasing the recurring sales of our high gross margin disposable products. Increasing the numbers of productive LiDCO-enabled monitors should ultimately increase the amount of disposables used in hospitals.

Our technology satisfies our customers' need for a product that can support their clinical decision-making across the care continuum as aligned with ERAS and PSH protocols. This has been further reinforced by the launch early this year of our LiDCOunityproduct offering non-invasive, minimally invasive and calibrated solutions with one disposable. Maintaining our technology leadership is key and we continue to invest in further product enhancements and expect to enter a cycle of annual product releases moving forward.

As recently announced we continue to see evidence of our products improving patient outcomes in different clinical applications by the independent research published this year and will look for the commercial opportunities arising from these.

Geographical expansion remains the greatest driver of future growth and we continue to focus our efforts on developing sustainable, repeatable businesses outside our core UK market. As the world's largest single market for hemodynamic monitoring, the USA represents a significant opportunity for us. Since late 2012 we have sold directly into USA hospitals via a small direct sales force, and we continue to expand our presence and investigate ways to address the market access challenge.

In the UK we believe that we can continue to increase our market share. Many hospitals use multiple hemodynamic monitoring technologies from a number of suppliers. With our differentiated offering we are well placed to offer a single solution that can enable these users to consolidate to a single supplier for hemodynamic monitoring products. By doing this we aim to help hospitals better manage their financial costs and reduce their clinical risks.

After the USA, Japan is the second largest market for hemodynamic monitoring in the world. Japan is a conservative market and we are working closely with our existing strategic partners as we seek new distributors to drive greater growth for our reimbursed product offering. We recently launched our non-invasive product in Japan and feel that this new offering with a revitalised commercial effort has the potential to improve our sales in this key market.

As part of a more targeted sales approach we have selected markets within Europe, Middle East and Asia where we have identified strong growth opportunities. Outside these key target countries we have started to work with regional distribution management organisations to help support the growing demand for hemodynamic monitoring as it gathers more global interest.

Outlook

LiDCO has had a strong start to the year, aligned to the tactical initiatives that we implemented last year. Traditionally our results are second half weighted and we expect this to be the same this year. We foresee 2016/17 as being a year of sales growth and cash generation allowing us to continue to invest in the business to achieve the growth opportunities that we believe are available with our proven and patented technology.

NOTES TO THE INTERIM STATEMENT

1. BASIS OF PREPRATION

The Group's interim report for the six months ended 31 July 2016 were authorised for issue by the directors on 11 October 2016. The consolidated interim financial information, which is unaudited, does not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of Section 435 of the Companies Act 2006. Accordingly, this condensed report is to be read in conjunction with the Annual Report for the year ended 31 January 2016, which has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union, and any public announcements made by the Group during the interim reporting period.

The statutory accounts for the year ended 31 January 2016 have been reported on by the Group's auditors, received an unqualified audit report and have been filed with the registrar of companies at Companies House. The unaudited condensed interim financial statements for the six months ended 31 July 2016 have been drawn up using accounting policies and presentation expected to be adopted in the Group's full financial statements for the year ending 31 January 2017, which are not expected to be significantly different to those set out in note 1 to the Group's audited financial statements for the year ended 31 January 2016.

The interim report has not been audited but it has been reviewed under the International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410 of the Auditing Practices Board.

After review of the Group's operations, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the unaudited condensed interim financial statements.

2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The interim financial information has been prepared on the basis of the recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS, which were the accounting policies used in the Report and Accounts for the Group for the year ended 31 January 2016. The accounting policies are unchanged from those used in the last annual accounts.

Independent review report to LiDCO Group Plc

Introduction

We have been engaged by the Company to review the financial information in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 31 July 2016 which comprises the condensed consolidated comprehensive income statement, condensed consolidated balance sheet, condensed consolidated comprehensive cashflow statement, condensed consolidated statement of changes in shareholders' equity and notes. We have read the other information contained in the half yearly financial report which comprises only the Chief Executive Officer's Review and considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed set of financial statements.

This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with guidance contained in ISRE (UK and Ireland) 2410, 'Review of Interim Financial Information performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity'. Our review work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company those matters we are required to state to them in a review report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company, for our review work, for this report, or for the conclusion we have formed.

Directors' responsibilities

The half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors. The AIM rules of the London Stock Exchange require that the accounting policies and presentation applied to the financial information in the half-yearly financial report are consistent with those which will be adopted in the annual accounts having regard to the accounting standards applicable for such accounts.

As disclosed in Note 1 the annual financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial information in the half-yearly financial report has been prepared in accordance with the basis of preparation in Note 1.

Our responsibility

Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the financial information in the half-yearly financial report based on our review.

Scope of review

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410, 'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity' issued by the Auditing Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom. A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

Conclusion

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 31 July 2016 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the basis of accounting described in Note 1.
