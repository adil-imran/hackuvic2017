The US is still reluctant to take measures to force rebels under its control to implement the Syrian ceasefire, Russia's Defense Ministry said, adding that"After five days of the ceasefire, it has to be noted that. On its own initiative, Russia prolonged the cessation of hostilities for 48 hours, and yesterday it was extended for another 72 hours," senior Russian General Staff official, Viktor Poznikhir, said at a briefing in Moscow.But, according to Poznikhir, it is very different on the American side asThe Russian official pointed out that "the main priority of the Russian-American agreements of September was the division of territories controlled by IS (Islamic State, formerly ISIS/ISIL), Jabhat al-Nusra, and the areas controlled by the 'moderate opposition,' as well the separation of the 'moderate opposition' from Jabhat al-Nusra."Such a division is essential for the implementation of the ceasefire in Syria because "without it, the hands of the government forces are tied. They can't fight the terrorists without knowing which of them joined the truce and who didn't," he explained., which "raises doubts over the US's ability to influence opposition groups under their control and their willingness to further ensure the implementation of the Geneva agreements."Russia is making every possible effort to hold off government troops from the use of force in return [to opposition attacks]. If the US does not implement the necessary measures to fulfill their obligations under the September 9 agreements, the responsibility for the failure of the ceasefire will be solely America's," Poznikhir said.The inaction of the American side has already led to a worsening of the situation in Syria, the General Staff official stressed.," he said.. The positions of government troops, the people's militia, and civilians were fired at on 55 occasions," Poznikhir added.Last week, Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, and US Secretary of State, John Kerry, agreed to influence the Syrian government and the so-called moderate rebel forces respectively in order to establish a ceasefire in the country.Since then, Russia has repeatedly complained that the US is failing to keep its part of the bargain. While the US, on its part, blamed Russia for not pressuring Damascus enough to facilitate humanitarian access to Syria.Speaking at a briefing Friday, senior Russian General Staff official Viktor Poznikhir said thatunder the latest US-Russian agreement on Syria. However, they had to return to their positions after being shelled by rebels, he added."On the Castello road, governmental forces have pulled back tanks, armored personnel carriers and artillery to an agreed distance to create a demilitarized zone," senior Russian General Staff official Viktor Poznikhir told journalists in Moscow during a briefing Friday.Poznikhir added that. At the same time, the deputy chief of the Russian Reconciliation Center in Syria, Sergey Kapitsyn, said that radar images and visual observation also show that opposition groups did not withdraw from the road.Kapitsyn stressed that Syrian army forces came under "heavy mortar and small-arms fire" near the Castello road. As a result,, he said, adding thatThe Castello road should serve as a humanitarian corridor to deliver much-needed UN aid to civilians in the besieged city and the neighboring regions, according to the agreement negotiated by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and his US counterpart, John Kerry, in Geneva on September 9., the Russian military has warned.
