The fortunes of one of Denmark’s most visible MEPs seem to be worsening day by day.

Morten Messerschmidt — who received more personal votes than any other candidate in the 2014 European elections when he ran a campaign promising to combat EU fraud — has been accused of misusing EU funds once again.

According to reports in Danish media, Messerschmidt spent EU funds on Danish People’s Party (DF) summer camps in 2014 and 2015, even though the money, about €26,000, was meant to be spent on events related to his now-defunct pan-European party, the Movement for a Europe of Liberties and Democracy (MELD).

On Wednesday, the Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet reported that Messerschmidt had listed a conference on “the Danish welfare state from the Euroskeptic perspective” in paperwork documenting EU-financed activities, even though the politician listed as the main speaker said he had never spoken at a MELD conference but rather at an unrelated event that day.

The allegations leveled against Messerschmidt echo earlier charges of misusing EU funds as well as using people’s names without their knowledge and seemingly placing them at MELD events where they claim not to have been present.

On Tuesday, Kristian Thulesen Dahl, leader of the Danish People’s Party, announced that Messerschmidt would be stepping down from the party leadership. After the last round of allegations in August, Messerschmidt resigned as leader of the DF delegation of MEPs in the Parliament but remained the chief whip of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group.

A spokesman for Messerschmidt referred any questions to MEP Anders Vistisen, who took over the leadership role. His spokesman also declined to comment.

“We have read the allegations made in the media and we are now seeking to establish the facts,” the ECR spokesman said when contacted Wednesday. “The leader of our Danish delegation, Anders Vistisen, has sought an urgent meeting with the European Parliament’s administration to clarify the situation, and he has made clear that any monies that the Parliament deem to have paid in error will be repaid.”

The Danish People’s Party has charged Vistisen with investigating the allegations but since he is also embroiled in a separate EU funding scandal, some have questioned his role. It’s not an investigation that people “can have any kind of confidence in,” Lars Bo Langsted, a Danish law professor, told JydskeVestkysten.

Vistisen reportedly used EU funds to pay for a group of DF activists, who campaigned for him during elections, to visit Brussels at a cost to taxpayers of about €14,700 — even though the visit took place when the institutions were closed.

For Messerschmidt, who received 465,758 personal votes in the 2014 European elections and had long been tipped to enter national politics, the fall from grace has been dramatic.

Messerschmidt’s troubles began last year when MEP Rikke Karlsson started asking questions about how MELD — to which she had been named as a board member without her knowledge — was spending EU funds. When Messerschmidt refused to grant her access to MELD’s accounts, she resigned from the party in protest.

Messerschmidt responded by calling her “a girl” who he said was in over her head after arriving in Brussels from a small town in Denmark.

A subsequent investigation by the European Parliament resulted in Messerschmidt being told to repay around €400,000 of EU funds, half of which he still refuses to give back.

In contravention of rules governing the funding of European political parties, EU funds had been spent on political campaigning as well as a golden parachute worth €170,000 for a MELD consultant, the Parliament investigation found. Another €16,000 of EU funds had been spent on renting a schooner for a Danish People’s Party’s summer cruise in 2013.

Karlsson, who also filed a police complaint in August against Messerschmidt for identity theft, said the issue goes deeper. “There’s still around 20 million kroner [€2.7 million] that isn’t accounted for. This isn’t good for the EU. People want to know how their money is being spent.”

She confirmed that she is due to meet with investigators from the European anti-fraud office, known by its French acronym OLAF, next month. Her former colleague, DF MEP Jørn Dohrmann, spent Monday afternoon answering questions on the same issue.

Spokespeople for the European Parliament and OLAF declined to comment.
