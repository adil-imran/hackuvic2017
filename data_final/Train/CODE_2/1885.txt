Will fin breid, barley-bree an paintit room. Whan MacLean meets wi's friens in Springburn. Aa thae roses an geeans will turn tae blume. An a black laud frae yont Nyanga. Dings the fell gallows o the burghers doun.

Black an white ane-til-ither mairriet. Mak the vile barracks o thair maisters bare. Sae come aa ye at hame wi freedom. Never heed whit the houdies croak for Doom. In yer hous aa the bairns o Aidam.

Tak the road an seek ither loanins. Wi thair ill-ploys tae sport an play. Nae mair will our bonnie callants. Merch tae war whan our braggarts crousely craw. Nor wee weans frae pitheid an clachan. Murn the ships sailin doun the Broomielaw. Broken faimilies in launs we've hairriet. Will curse 'Scotlan the Brave' nae mair, nae mair.

Roch the win i the clear day's dawin. Blaws the clouds heilster-gowdie owre the bay. But thair's mair nor a roch win blawin. Thro the Great Glen o the warl the day. It's a thocht that wad gar our rottans. Aa thae rogues that gang gallus fresh an gay.

SCOTTISH winter music festival Celtic Connections launched its programme for 2017 yesterday, with what is probably the most eclectic line up in their 13-year history.

SCOTTISH winter music festival Celtic Connections launched its programme for 2017 yesterday, with what is probably the most eclectic line up in their 13-year history.

Organisers themselves admit it is a “startlingly long way from Sandy in Grease to Celtic Connections”, but Olivia Newton-John will “cover that distance” in a concert with country stars Beth Neilsen Chapman and Amy Sky where they will explore grief, personal loss and survival.

Festival boss Donald Shaw launched the programme yesterday, saying the Let’s Get Physical star would be one of 2,100 musicians from across the world heading to Glasgow for the annual celebration of of roots, folk and world music.

Martha Wainwright, Billy Bragg, Fairport Convention, Shirley Collins and Karine Polwart were among some of the other big names announced yesterday.

Laura Marling will open the festival with the world premiere of orchestrations of her songs by Kate St John with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. But as always with Celtic Connections, some of the most exciting concerts are the ones buried deep down in the thick 17-day programme.

This year’s Roaming Roots Revue, celebrating musical links between Scotland and America, is dedicated to “The Women in Song”, a key theme of the festival, with performances of music by Kate Bush, Joni Mitchell, Nina Simone, sung by well known musicians including Emma Pollock.

The Beat Bothy night, which mixes electronic and Celtic music returns after a year off. The night was a staple Celtic Connections event in the Arches before that club shut down. Skye’s Niteworks are set to headline.

One of the more poignant gigs will A Night for Angus, with Shooglenifty paying tribute to their fiddler and “Shoogle-wife” Angus R Grant who died earlier this month after a short illness.

La Banda Europa led by Jim Sutherland, star-studded folk orchestra Unusual Suspects, fiddle super-group Session A9, Edinburgh’s Dallahan, the premiere of piping project Tryst, Ireland’s festival favourites Sharon Shannon and Four Men & A Dog, are all lined up.

There’s a big Canadian contingent as well, with Le Vent Du Nord, De Temps Antan and Russell deCarle all coming to Glasgow.

Scottish artists Evelyn Glennie, Pictish Trail, Liz Lochhead, Aidan Moffat, King Creosote, Siobhan Miller and Anna Meredith all have gigs scheduled during the festival.

Shaw said: “A breath-taking range of styles and traditions radiates throughout Celtic Connections 2017. Artists who have shaped the present day and artists who are re-defining music for the future will take to the stage. Artists whose lives and cultures could not be more different will come together to share their stories, passion and skill. At the heart of it all is the simple life-affirming experience of being at a live music performance during a world leading festival. We can’t wait for Celtic Connections 2017 to begin.”

Alan Morrison, former music writer for The National, and now head of music at Creative Scotland, said: “Celtic Connections is now firmly established as the winter destination of choice not only for lovers of folk and traditional music, but also for anyone who wants to embrace culture on a global scale.”

One of the more interesting tales in the programme, is that of Aziza Brahim, born and raised in the Saharawi refugee camps lining the frontier between Algeria and Western Sahara. As a young teenager she fled these camps and the regime of political oppression that followed Morocco’s 1975 invasion of Western Sahara to live in Cuba.

As an adult she returned to the Saharawi camps and began singing and playing in different musical ensembles. She is now a best selling world music artist whose work is infused with influences of her Western Sahara roots and Barcelona, where has lived since 2000, and remains a spokesperson for the

Saharawi people and their ongoing struggle.
