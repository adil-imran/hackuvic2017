HARARE – The United States mission in Harare this week voiced concern over the continued disappearance of pro-democracy activist Itai Dzamara, and called on authorities to redouble efforts to find him.

Dzamara was abducted on March 9, by five men while he was at a barbers shop in Harare’s Glen View suburb.

The abductors are said to have accused him of stealing cattle before handcuffing him, forcing him into a white truck with concealed number plates and driving off. He has not been seen since.

Last Sunday, August 9, marked five months since the disappearance of Zimbabwean civil society activist.

Police say there have been no leads in the investigations so far, but critics say the lack of available public information on the investigation’s progress is disappointing and the US embassy in Harare is now demanding that Zimbabwe steps up its efforts to find Dzamara.

“The United States remains deeply concerned about Mr. Dzamara’s whereabouts and wellbeing, and we are equally concerned by the apparent lack of progress by authorities in their investigation,” the US embassy said in a statement.

“We join the European Union in their calls to the Zimbabwean authorities to mobilise their resources to investigate the circumstances surrounding Mr. Dzamara’s abduction, to accord Mr. Dzamara the full protection of his fundamental human rights and freedoms, and to ensure that those responsible for his abduction are brought to justice.”

The US embassy said it “places the protection of human rights at the center of our foreign policy.”

“The United States stands together with Mr. Dzamara and the people of Zimbabwe in supporting their right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly,” the statement said.

“We call for Mr. Dzamara’s immediate and safe return to his family and friends.”

His family held a prayer vigil for him last Sunday in the Africa Unity Square where he has been arbitrarily arrested and severely beaten by both State security agents and members of the ruling Zanu PF party for his activism.

Dzamara, leader of the Occupy Africa Unity Square protest group, previously submitted a petition to President Robert Mugabe, calling on him to resign and pave way for fresh elections. – Daily News
