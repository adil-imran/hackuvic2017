NEW DELHI: A series of rallies and marches in August and early September by Jamaat-ud-Dawah and its front organisation, Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation (FIF), in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir with purported backing from the Pakistani establishment may have been a prelude to the terror strike at an Indian Army camp at Uri , said security experts.The two outfits organised the events to protest against what they alleged atrocities by the Indian Army in Jammu and Kashmir, show news reports published in Muzaffarabad and Mirpur before the September 18 Uri terror strake.A group of activists from Pakistan, led by retired admiral Fasih Bokhari , for the first time travelled to Muzaffarabad to express solidarity with Kashmiris on August 1. On August 3, activists of the FIF, which has been designated as a terror organisation by the US, tried to supply medicines to J&K and also staged a sit-in-protest, PoK-based daily Mirpur News reported.On the same day, the administration in PoK suspended trade across the Line of Control with India, it reported. A day before that, separatist group Hurriyat Conference’s PoK chapter had protested against Home Minister Rajnath Singh’s visit to Islamabad for a Saarc meeting.The FIF again staged a sit-in protest on August 4, this time along the LoC demanding to supply relief material to Jammu and Kashmir, reported Jammu Kashmir Times, another PoK-based media house.In mid-August, the PoK chapter of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front organised a protest march against the so called atrocities in Kashmir.
