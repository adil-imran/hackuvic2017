Police chiefs BLASTED for sending officers into gang ridden 'no-go zones' in France

FRENCH police chiefs have been heavily criticised for sending officers into gang-ridden "no-go zones" after two officers were seriously injured in a petrol bomb attack this weekend.

The officials were on patrol on the Grande Borne, a notorious housing estate in Paris, at the time of the sickening attack.

Eyewitnesses said they were "attacked from all sides" by the cowardly mob, who threw Molotov cocktails at the officers - who were badly burned and rushed to intensive care units in hospital.

The incident, in which around 15 people attacked a patrol car in broad daylight on Saturday, further highlighted a national debate on security as France prepares for next year's presidential election.

Now officers are calling for greater protecting when they enter so-called "no-go zones" plagued by tough gangs and violent warfare.

Nicolas Comte, a spokesman for France's second-biggest police union Unite SGP Police, said: "We're very angry. It is surreal that colleagues be injured on such a mission."

Denis Jacob from the union Alternative police-CFDT said: Of course there are no-go zones in France where the police cannot intervene and do their jobs in safety. And its the same for fire fighters or pretty much any representative of the state.

The police cant apply the law in these areas, they are attacked. If the police cant do their work its because there are criminals and delinquents who dont respect the law.

Its not just a problem with this government its a problem with all French governments over the last 20 years. Governments will never admit there are no-go zones because its a sign of a failed state."

Unions urged staff to take part in silent protests tomorrow, and called for a go-slow in the area where the attack was carried out to press the government to give police more resources.

The CFDT union said: "Despite all the reassurances, there are still no-go zones in France ruled by a handful of gangs of criminals who get more and more radical as the years go by."

According to Frances national crime observatory, the number of police and gendarmes (military police) injured while on duty rose by 25 per cent between 2010 and 2015.

n 2015 some 5,674 police officers were injured in the line of duty compared to 4,535 back in 2010.

For the gendarmes the rise was even more striking  1,807 injuries in 2015 compared to 1,408 in 2010.

Now, although security is dominating the agenda in the run-up to the presidential and parliamentary elections next April, officials have refused to listen to union bosses over the "no-go zones".

In a press conference after the attack, prime minister Manuel Valls acknowledged there are particularly difficult areas.

But he said: The authority of the state will be guaranteed. There are no no-go zones.

Mr Valls promised all would be done to bring those responsible for the petrol bomb attack to justice adding: These individuals will be found, brought to justice and severely punished because when we attack the police, we attack France itself."

The attack also sparked calls from political adversaries for the resignation of Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.

French President Francois Hollande condemned the violence, which also led to another two officers receiving minor injuries.

He said: "Everything will be done to find the perpetrators of this attack and bring them to justice."

The incident was "unspeakable" because it "endangered the lives of officers whose job was to protect the population", he added.

But opponents were quick to accuse Mr Hollande's socialist government of being a soft touch on law and order.

Alain Juppe, the centre-right politician that opinion polls favour to become France's next president, said: "A strong state is a state that does not go into retreat, a state that gets rid of no-go zones."

The attack comes during a state of emergency put in place across France following a string of Islamic State terror attacks.

Warped jihadists slaughtered 130 people across Paris last November, while 86 people were killed in Nice while celebrating Bastille Day in July.

Protests against the government over employment reform has also seen a series of savage attacks on police officers.

Grande Borne, a housing project that was built in the 1960s, is now officially classed as a "sensitive security area".

Yes, the same Moslem no-go zones the MSM assured us didn't exist. The big media propagandists lambasted Trump for calling a rag a rag. There's ZERO chance of them admitting they were wrong and that Trump, as usual, was right.

If Hitlery wins, we’ll need our own no-go zones. Otherwise we’ll be in her deplorable fun camps.

So called “No Go” zones mean that there has been a breakdown of society. Even worse, a breakdown civilization.

The article didn’t mention WHO is blasting the Police Chiefs for sending their cops into these zones. The tone of the article was - everyone wants this problem solved. So who is doing the “blasting?”



To: Sasparilla

Who decided that No Go Zones were tolerable in the first place?

The No-Go Zones need to be changed to Free-Fire Zones.



To: Mr. Mojo

No go zones need to be attacked and brought into line, with the army if need be.
