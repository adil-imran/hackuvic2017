              Minister of Economic Development and Trade Deron Bilous says access to capital for small businesses will benefit Alberta's economy. (CBC)            Alberta plans to offer up to $90 million in tax credits for investments in small businesses in the technology and tourism sectors.The 30 per cent tax credit would be offered over the next three years for investments in companies involved in proprietary technology, interactive digital media development, video post-production, digital animation or tourism.The tax credit will create 4,400 jobs and $500 million in economic growth, said Deron Bilous, economic development minister in a press release on Thursday."Our small businesses have a bigger economic impact than small businesses anywhere else in Canada. More access to capital for them means more jobs and a more diversified economy for our province."But University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe is skeptical of that claim, in part because it's hard to measure."There's still research ongoing about how temporary investment credits do affect the economy. They do show investment will grow, employment will grow and GDP will grow, but it's very hard to pin down the precise effect of a particular policy, so we may not ever know," he said.The government says the program was put together in consultation with Calgary's business community. The tax credit will be introduced this fall in the Alberta legislature.Severe weather warnings or watches in effect for:TD Bank raises mortgage prime rate to 2.85%Fiscal update boosts Liberal infrastructure plans but offers no path back to balanceAcute hepatitis after heavy energy drink use 'a warning to the consumer,' liver specialist saysSelf-reported Alberta thalidomide survivor calls government compensation criteria unfairTo paraphrase Nixon, when Clinton hides emails, it is not illegal: Neil MacdonaldTrudeau to open doors of top-secret parliamentary committee, give new powers to StatsCan chiefResearchers reverse-engineer Chinese streaming services to learn how they're censored'My life is a nightmare': Windsor man, 27, wants legally assisted deathGerry Lougheed, Pat Sorbara charged in Sudbury byelection scandalWhat's really driving Toronto's red-hot real estate market'Time for revolution': Trump's Deep South diehards ready for revolt if he losesB.C. court to rule on Christian law school grads TuesdayNorthern Sask. suicides top priority for new children's advocateHalifax pair survives 'terrifying night' in Dracula's castle in RomaniaKey players in Dakota Access pipeline fight©2016 CBC/Radio-Canada.
