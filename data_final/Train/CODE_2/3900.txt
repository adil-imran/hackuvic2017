The Nigerian Army, yesterday, concluded a military drill to train its Special Forces on operations in maritime environment in Twon Brass, a coastal settlement in Bayelsa State.

Minister of Defence, Brig.-Gen. Mansur Dan Ali (retd), who spoke at the closing ceremony, said the exercise code named Operation Crocodile Smile, was aimed at enhancing operational effectiveness in the creeks.

Ali, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, Mr Danjuma Sheni, noted that the exercise was also to defend the territory and secure the area.

He said that the idea was to stimulate the troops in a drill to see how effective they can be in carrying out their operations.

“We have the capacity, the expertise and the manpower to defend this area, the people and oil facilities. It is not to harass, intimidate or threaten the community but to protect them from miscreants and oil thieves,” the Minister said.

According to him, the exercise was preceded by consultations with the community leaders in the area and sensitisation of the people on the importance of the exercise.

“We made the people to understand that the troops are here for them, so we built trust and confidence in the residents and allayed their fears. We cannot allow some criminal elements to continue to operate along the waterways killing innocent people who are busy going about their legitimate businesses. We want to make the waterways safe,” he said.

He said that the launch of Operation Crocodile Smile was to checkmate the activities of militant groups, pipeline vandals, illegal bunkerers, among other maritime crimes.

In his remark, the Chief of Army staff, Lt.-Gen. Tukur Burutai, said that the exercise had achieved tremendous results and improved the combat readiness of the troops.

The Army Chief said that several arms and ammunition had been recovered from criminals, while destruction of illegal refineries carried out during the operation would continue.

He observed that the challenges were enormous but assured the troops that with the support of the military high command, success was imminent.

“We are not working alone, all the security agencies are with us and we are partnering to fight these criminals.

“They have turned our water ways to criminal haven and made them unsafe for innocent people that pass through to go about their legal businesses,” the Army Chief said.

No fewer than 10,000 army personnel have been trained in the exercise, which the Chief of Army Staff said would continue at regular intervals.
