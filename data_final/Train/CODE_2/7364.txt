The Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS) Court yesterday ordered the immediate release from detention of a former National Security Adviser, retired Colonel Sambo Dasuki.

The court condemned the attitude of the federal government in the case and imposed a fine of N15m against the government. There was no immediate reaction from government officials.

Dasuki had been detained since December 2015.The court held that his detention violated both national and international laws on the right of persons and citizens to freedom of liberty.In a judgement delivered by Justice Friday Chijioike Nwoke, the court said the fine would serve as compensatory damages to Dasuki for the deprivation of his freedom to liberty and deprivation of his properties.The judgment which lasted for over one hour dismissed the allegations of unlawful possession of firearms and economic crimes against Dasuki, adding that the Nigerian government missed the track because the applicant applied before the court for the enforcement of his breached rights and contravention of his fundamental right.Justice Nwoke said that even if the applicant had committed a crime, the law still had it that due process must be observed in his trial, adding that it was an established fact that Dasuki was put on trial in three different High Courts and was granted bail by the courts.Justice Chijioke said the Nigerian government made mockery of the rule of law by arresting Dasuki without a warrant of arrest or warrant of detention when he had legally been granted bail by the appropriate courts. According to the court, a detention order must be made in writing and must be delivered to the detainees and in the case, none of such was obtained before arresting him and seizing his houses in Abuja and Sokoto.The court also said the claim that Dasuki was arrested and detained in his own interest, was an assault to the Nigerian constitution and other international laws because there was no iota of evidence placed before the court that applicant applied for security protection.Dasuki had in March 2015 sued the government at the ECOWAS Court over his continued detention without trial.
