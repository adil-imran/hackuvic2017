ABC: In Haiti, a Factory Where Big Money, State Department and the Clintons Meet

ABC News ^ | October 11, 2016 | MATTHEW MOSK BRIAN ROSS BRIAN EPSTEIN CHO PARK

Posted on by maggief

Bill and Hillary Clinton have hailed the factory churning out Old Navy sweatshirts in an industrial park here as a shining achievement in their efforts to rebuild this island nation after a destructive earthquake in 2010.

But the garment factory has underdelivered on projected jobs. Haitian workers have accused managers of bullying and sexual harassment. And an ABC News investigation has found that after opening its factory in the Haitian industrial park  built with $400 million of global aid  the Korean firm became a Clinton Foundation donor and its owner invested in a startup company owned by Hillary Clintons former chief of staff.

(snip)

At the same time, the Clinton Foundation says it facilitated the construction of a luxury hotel in Port-au-Prince, a Marriott owned by Denis OBrien, who has given $10 million to $25 million to the Clinton Foundation. OBrien, an Irish billionaire who runs the Jamaica-based telecom giant Digicel, said he financed the hotel himself.

(snip)

The modern industrial park, with wide, clear roads connecting rows of low-slung warehouses, would be paid for by the Inter-American Development Bank, which provided $256.8 million in grants to support construction. The bank has donated $1 million to $5 million to the Clinton Foundation, according to its website. Large American retailers, including Wal-Mart and Gap Inc., have served as buyers for the clothes shipped from Haiti to the U.S. with special U.S. tax breaks. Wal-Mart has given $1 million to $5 million, and Gap has given $100,000 to $250,000 to the foundation. And in 2012, SAE-A, the Korean garment company that was recruited to become the anchor tenant of the park, gave $50,000 to $100,000 to the foundation.

Two years after the factory was operational, Mills had left the State Department. She turned up, according to an online press release, at a Sae-A company event in Costa Rica. She appeared there, the release said, on behalf of her privately owned international development firm, Black Ivy Group. Ms. Mills was invited and came to the event as a guest, as did many others, Garwood said, in response to questions from ABC News. The chairman of SAE-A, Woong-ki Kim, was identified on the Black Ivy website as one of the initial investors in the firm. That page has since been taken down. The chairmans investment in Black Ivy was a personal investment that was not made until late in 2014, Garwood said. As a policy, the chairman does not discuss his personal investments. Black Ivy Group is described on its website as a firm that builds and grows commercial enterprises in sub-Saharan Africa and focuses on building and leveraging a vast network of global and local relationships spanning the public, private and government sectors. Mills partner in the venture, Jean-Louis Warnholz, worked on the Caracol project in Haiti while serving as a senior State Department adviser to Hillary Clinton.

Maybe they are publishing these Haiti collusion stories so that when Trump (hopefully) talks about what happened with billions in aid that was supposed to build housing, they can say it’s old news and dismiss it. Hundreds of Haitians died just last week. Were they still living in very unstable shacks? Where are the strong houses that were supposed to be built? Where did the money go? ...mixed up with the Clintons and friends....



To: maggief

This is truly amazing, the second article BY ABC about the Clintons in Haiti!



To: maggief

I think they are banking on it being ‘too little, too late’ But they can come out afterwards and say they reported on it.

- September 21, 2016 - ​VOTER'S GUIDE TO CLINTON GRAFT HAITI "Sadly, when an earthquake rocked the nation of Haiti in 2010, corruption moved in faster than the help so desperately needed. Today, the people of Haiti are still suffering despite the billions of dollars that have flowed into the Clinton Foundation. The Clintons exploited this terrible disaster to steal billions of dollars from the sick and starving people of Haiti. The world trusted the Clintons to help the Haitian people during their most desperate time of need and they were deceived. The Clintons and their friends are richer today while millions still live in tents. The world deserves to know where the money went and why help was never sent."  Bernard Sansaricq, Former President of the Senate, Republic of Haiti. Digicel received the first cellular award of $2.5 million so Haitians could receive money over a mobile phone network. The Digicel Group is owned by Irish billionaire Denis OBrien, who has given $10 million to the Clinton Foundation.

Coincidentally the United States government paid Digicel $45 million to open a hotel in Port-au-Prince. The Digicel Group teamed up with Marriott International in 2011 in Port-au-Prince to build a luxury hotel.

For $55 million USAID was supposed to build 4,000 houses outside Haitis capital by 2012 but only 816 have been constructed even though funding increased to a startling $90 million. Caracol built a textile factory in northern Haiti, an area untouched by the earthquake. The factory was built to help Target, Walmart and the Gap, as the companies were able to use the Haitians for cheap labor which allowed them to cut down on costs. The Clintons declared Caracol would create 60,000 jobs. It created less than 5,000 jobs, had no impact on the Haitian economy, and did nothing to help rebuild southern Haiti - the actual part of the country that was destroyed by the earthquake. The next time Hillary says she cares about you, remember how the Clintons and their donor friends ripped off the Haitians ...

The conniving Clintons usually leave out the stuff that incriminates them and their cronies in looting govt agencies.....and massive abuse of govt power and conflict of interest. ITEM-- Hillary's top aide (and her personal attorney) at the State Dept, Cheryl Mills, runs the BlackIvy Group, a consulting firm and development company that focuses on Sub-Saharan Africa. US govt employee, Cheryl Mills group, BlackIvy, is developing a privately-financed dry port that will be located 56 km outside of the Port of Dar es Salaam, and will use shuttle trains to take transit and upcountry cargo to and from the Port, BlackIvy spokeswoman Erin Pelton confirmed to Breitbart News. BlackIvy is focused on in-land logistics, not operating seaports, Pelton added, denying that BlackIvy is running into opposition from the Tanzania Ports Authority. So how did BlackIvy, a brand new firm with no discernible track record of building ports, manage to become an overnight player in the East African energy market? It turns out Clintons former aides had some help from a company called Symbion Power, which was created to profit off rebuilding efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan after the U.S. invasions. Symbion Power happens to be a very good friend of Hillary Clintons. BACKSTORY Hillary's pal, Sid Blumenthal was the conniving Clintons' bagman---a $325,000 employee of the Clinton Foundation, he had numerous paid side interests----promoting any number of foreign deals and schemes in which he had a financial interest.....many of which were predicated on the toppling of Libya's Khadaffi. Blumenthal was ambidextrous---chronically emailing Hillary Libya foreign policy messages w/ one hand....his other hand firmly in the State Dept cookie jar. In one confidential e-mail to Clinton, Blumenthal was clearly colluding w/ onetime Amb Joe Wilson (Valerie Plame's hubby) to help himself to the tax dollars in the State Dept cookie jar. GAME ON Amb Wilson pumped himself up as a 'director' of Symbion Power---an outfit seeking millions of dollars in contracts from an obscure government agency chaired by Hillary....the Millennium Challenge Corp. (MCC) In September 2010, Hillary's MCC awarded Symbion $47 million tax dollars for (cough) 'power projects in Tanzania.' EVER WONDER how much of the $47 million tax dollars got to Tanzania....after the players divvied it up among Blumenthal, Wilson, the Clintons, Obama? <><> Did Mills BlackIvy Group donate to The Clinton Foundation? <><> Did the Clinton Foundation partner w/ her BlackIvy Group in some phony sub-Sahara scam for the children? <><> Did Hillarys State Dept grant Mills Group tax monies? <><>Did any of the Sub-Sahara countries listed above donate to the Clinton Foundation? NOTE Millenium is also the source of the 100 million tax dollars Michele gave to Morocco "to teach Muslim girls" =========================================== FREEPER ACTION PROJECT--DO THIS NOW: demand the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) books be opened. We demand to know the financial details and the scope and dimension of individuals connected to these outrageous State Dept giveaways.........govt parasites profiting at taxayers' expense. CONTACT CONGRESS HERE---http://www.contactingthecongress.org/ ============================================= REFERENCE--- Hillary Clinton visited Tanzania in June 2011. Where did she go to speak? The Symbion Power Plant in Dar Es Salaam, where she spoke in front of Symbion and General Electric (GE) logos. Soon after the speech, Clinton intervened in a business deal between Symbion and GE to help Symbions interests in Tanzania. An attendee quietly captured Clinton on video after her speech chatting up business executives, including one from General Electric. Hi, Chris. Nice to see you. Thanks for GEs contributions (to the foundation). I really appreciate it. Youll have to tell Jeff Immelt  or, Ill call him to tell him how much I appreciate it, Clinton said to the General Electric official, referring to the GE CEO. http://littlesis.org/org/158171/BlackIvy_Group =========================================== ITEM-- As of January 2016, the following countries were designated by ICE as "uncooperative" in accepting their citizens----deportees who committed crimes in the US : Afghanistan, Algeria, Burundi, Cape Verde, China, Cuba, Eritrea, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, India, Iran, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, and Zimbabwe.

What is up with ABC? This is the 2nd truthfull article i have read today from them. A smart news organization would realize what a golden opportunity this election is giving them if they would stop the propaganda and report reals news. I would not hold my breath with ABC but miracles do happen.

REALITY CHECK---"Better dig a little deeper, ABC." ABC reported the Clinton Foundation facilitated the construction of a luxury hotel in Port-au-Prince, a Marriott owned by Denis OBrien, who has given $10 million to $25 million to the Clinton Foundation. OBrien, an Irish billionaire who runs the Jamaica-based telecom giant Digicel, said he financed the hotel himself. THE CLINTONS' PRACTICED ABILITY TO GET RICH EXPLOITING NATIONAL DISASTERS UNDER COVER OF THE CLINTON FOUNDATION IS LEGENDARY and the Clintons "do-good" w/ your tax dollars. Haiti, the Clintons and Digicel BFF---Clinton and Digicel CEO/billionaire. Dennis O'Brien.

O'Brien chairs the Clinton Foundation's Global Initiative---Haiti Action Network.

US tax dollars poured into O'Brien's coffers thanks to the Clintons. EXCERPT Free Beacon May 2015--- The Clintons have been working with Digicel CEO Denis OBrien in Haiti since 2010, in the wake of the disastrous earthquake. Bill Clinton and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had been active players in the country before the quake, but would assume almost total managerial control over the recovery effort via the State Department and the Clinton Foundation. As Peter Schweizer documents in his book, "Clinton Cash," Digicel received millions in U.S. tax dollars from USAID, an agency overseen by the State Department, as part of the Haiti Mobile Money Initiative. The program was designed to establish a mobile money-transfer system that would allow individuals to send donations directly to friends and relatives in Haiti. The State Department's "USAID Food for Peace" program, which was under the direct control of Hillary Clintons top aide Cheryl Mills, benefited Digicel.....to administer money transfers over its mobile network. Haitians received cell phones and a free Digicel account. Digicel received grants courtesy of U.S. taxpayers, and collected millions in fees from Haitians every time they used the system, and significantly expanded its user base. By 2012, Digicel had captured nearly 80 percent of the Haitian mobile phone market, and Haiti had surpassed Jamaica as the companys most profitable market. Revenues were up 14 percent compared to 2011, and Digicels subscriber base increased by almost 30 percent during that period. OBrien, who holds a 94 percent stake in the privately owned firm, continued to rake in cash. In 2014 alone, OBrien awarded himself $650 million worth of dividends. MORE AT http://freebeacon.com/blog/oh-denny-boy-how-the-clintons-helped-an-irish-telecom-tycoon-makes-millions-in-earthquake-ravaged-haiti/ ========================================= Time to look at Malta to find more dirt on the Clintons. BACKSTORY Secy Hillary poured billions of our tax dollars into dirt-poor, earthquake-ravaged Haiti as Bill put on his "do-good" act. But Haitian Americans protested the Clinton Foundation offices say dirt-poor Haitians never got a dime...all of the tax dollars have been laundered into the foundation. REALITY CHECK In some Haitian mountain villages there's no electricity (maybe generators for a few hours), no water, no septic, etc. - but dirt-poor Haiti does have cell-phone coverage. Reading the many stories of Clinton "do-goodism" in Haiti....he is invariably standing before a Digicel sign. You can bet your bottom dollar the Clintons get a cut of that action. That's Digicel's CEO on the left. The Digicel Group is the Caribbean and Central American telecom empire run by Denis OBrien, an Irish billionaire who officially resides in Malta to avoid taxes. O'Brien, a multi-million dollar Foundation donor, serves as chairman of the Clinton Global Initiatives Haiti Action Network. Digicel, the largest mobile provider in Haiti, invested $45 million in the project, which also benefited from $26.5 million in financing from the World Bank-affiliated International Finance Corporation. Hillary also tapped the Sate Dept's USAID agency for more tax dollars for the tax-evadng billionaire. The State Dept's USAID Food for Peace program, under the direct control of Hillary Clintons top aide Cheryl Mills, benefited money-hungry Digicel .....to administer money transfers over its mobile network. Haitians received cell phones and a free Digicel account; Digicel received grants courtesy of U.S. taxpayers, collected millions in fees from Haitians every time they used the system, and significantly expanded its user base. But it was Bill Clinton who made it all happen.

Hillary Aide Shared Classified Information With Clinton Foundation, Email Shows; Cheryl Mills sent information marked confidential to Clinton Foundation in 2012 / BY Alana Goodman September 28, 2015 A member of Hillary Clinton/s staff at the Department of State emailed classified information about the government in Congo to a staffer at the Clinton Foundation in 2012, according to a copy of the correspondence obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. Cheryl Mills, Clinton/s chief of staff at the State Department, sent the email to the Clinton Foundations foreign policy director, Amitabh Desai, on July 12, 2012. The message, which was originally obtained by the group Citizens United through a public records request, is partially redacted because it includes foreign government information that has been classified as Confidential by the State Department. Although the information was not marked classified by the State Department until this past summer, intelligence sources tell the Free Beacon that it would have been classified at the time Mills sent it because foreign government information is considered classified from inception. The message could add to concerns from congressional and FBI investigators about whether former Secretary Clinton and her aides mishandled classified information while at the State Department. The email, which discussed the relationship between the governments in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, was originally drafted by Johnnie Carson, the State Departments assistant secretary for African affairs, who sent it to Mills State Department email address. Mills later forwarded the full message to Desai along with talking points for Presient [sic] Clinton shortly before Bill Clinton was scheduled to visit the region. About half of the forwarded message was redacted due to its classified nature before the State Department released it to Citizens United last month. Although it is not clear what the redacted section includes, the State Department said in a court motion filed last week that it concerns both foreign government information and critical aspects of U.S. foreign relations, including U.S. foreign activities carried out by officials of the U.S. Government. The State Department added that the disclosure of this information has the potential to damage and inject friction into our bilateral relationship with African countries whose cooperation is important to U.S. national security. The Clinton Foundation and the State Department did not respond to request for comment about the email, or say whether Desaia non-government employee who has worked at the foundation since 2007would have been authorized to view Confidential information. ---SNIP--- REST AT http://freebeacon.com/politics/clinton-aide-shared-classified-information-with-foundation-email-shows/ NOTE: AT THE SAME TIME MILLS FED STATE DEPT INTEL TO THE FOUNDATION, she was running BlackIvy---a money-making sub-Sahara Africa development company.
