I read Dolly Kyle’s book, Hillary, The Other Woman. In it she describes a visit that included some of Bill’s old close friends, herself, and Bill. Someone asked her to play the piano so she did and sang a song she wrote herself.

It was about “I love you” and was obvious the song was for Bill. Bill was standing staring out the window with his back to the group and when he turned around he had tears running down his face. One of his friends said to him “you are a f__king fool” Dolly is very beautiful, talented, educated. He passed that up because Hillary gloomed onto him to be POTUS.

To: ColdOne

The ONLY reason Bill is in awe of her is because, according to Bill’s conversation with Jennifer Flowers, only Hillary has eaten more Pu$$y than he has.



To: ColdOne

Can they prove that they had sex more than once or even once



To: ColdOne

His best Lesbian friend, Web Hubble’s, Vince Foster’s, and Yoko Ono’s sometimes object of fulfillment. Sing it Bill. I’m sure your rape victims will sense your undying loyalty. I know of one rape victim, a girl who was no longer able to have children after her rape, that Hillary laughed at, made fund of, that will understand how beautiful the two of you are. It’s so rewarding to see a marriage that has gone so swell. /s This family... America deserves better. First Family? Last family is more like it.

And he rewarded those 41 years by screwing anything that moved, raping anything that moved, etc etc



To: Lurkinanloomin

Slick probably started cheating on her at the reception. It was even before marriage. Check: Bill Clinton and Sally Miller. Hillary threatened her during her ‘courtship’ with bill. Probably thought ‘courtship’ meant going to be Queen of the court [she wants to be King, really].



To: ColdOne

Nothing says “best friend” like a flying ashtray... book....lamp.



To: ColdOne

I hope that they can share a cell so that the love story never ends.



To: ColdOne

Too late for me.....I shoulda been here earlier.....God help us all........

Oooh, that calls for a romantic night of whoopee for them. It won’t be with each other. BJ can carve another rape notch in his bedpost and Hellary can go find Huma wherever she’s been hiding out at the past couple weeks. Easier to just set out a bottle of alcohol for Hellary. It’s important to make her very happy.

Exactly correct. They have a "mutually assured destruction" thing going on between them.





To: ColdOne

What are the worst words Bill Clinton could hear while making love? Hillary saying, I want her next!



To: ColdOne

"Forty one years ago I married my best friend..." "...and if Hillary ever finds out she's gonna sue me for bigamy and bash me with another ash tray..."

Speaking of which, does anyone know why that thread was pulled? I skimmed past it last night waiting for friends at a restaurant, planning to check it out today. Did a search with no results. Googled it, and the story is everywhere, including a FR thread. Clicked on that link, and saw that the thread was pulled. Seems to be a legit story. And I was wondering if John Lennon’s name should be added to “The Clinton Body Count”. IIRC from back then, he was becoming a bit political with a conservative bent, and liked Reagan. Then ... oops ... dead.



To: ColdOne

It’s easy to call your wife your best friend when you’re constantly boofing and preying on vulnerable women: —One, you don’t have to have sex with Hillary (ewwwwww..., understandable). —Two, you can always count on Hillary to destroy your sexual assault victims and cover up your sex crimes. What binds Hillary and Bill together is their relentless lust for power, wealth, and their hatred of anyone who calls them out on their crimes. Also, each one knows where the bodies are buried, if one rats out the other, they both go to prison. Thus, they are “best friends.” (Please excuse me while I throw up.....)

The Clinton’s delayed 1975 honeymoon trip to Haiti was financed by an un-named friend. Imagine that, the man to become touted as Americ’s first black president and his purported bleeding heart liberal bride chose a Caribbean Island nation ruled by a despot, “Baby Doc” Duvalier. The chubby scion of the tyrant know as Papa Doc Duvalier. Baby Doc’s rule, as well as his fathers, was enforced by the Ton Ton Macoute, a murderous secret police force consisting of thugs. Oh that Bill, what a charming romantic dude. 37 years later the pair returned as former president and his Secretary of State wife to aid Haitians after the devastating earthquake. And then they really screwed Haiti.

Who goes to Haiti on a honeymoon? And who gets somebody else to pay for it? The Clintons were born sleazes and they’ll die sleazes. And tasteless ones, as well.

It is so gratifying to see this pig of a man slowly dying of AIDS and syphilis for all the world to see. Just like Yasser Arafat during his last days on earth before the worms sent him to the pit of hell.
