MUMBAI: Phaneesh Murthy 's online pharmacy venture Zigy plans to halt operations in next three months even as it scouts for a merger partner as part of plans to exit the business that has been rendered unviable by stringent regulation and its inability to raise funds, three people aware of the matter said.The company had last month scaled down operations in four cities, restricting its business to its home base, Bengaluru , citing regulatory hurdles. In the past few weeks, it has been in talks with other online pharmacy chains for a possible merger, the people said on condition of anonymity.But the merger plan looks difficult to execute, said a promoter of an e-pharmacy chain, who did not wish to be identified due to confidentiality of the talks.Another person said that Zigy has informed its existing partners that it will be winding up the business in the next three months.In response to ET's queries, Zigy said in an email that it is still doing business but is also looking for potential partners for merger."At this juncture we are alive and kicking and operational in Bangalore for retail customers and all five cities for our institutional customers," said Hemanth Bhardwaj , CEO of PM Health and Lifecare, the company that owns Zigy.E-commerce business needs continuous fundraising efforts, Bhardwaj said. "We explore the market for all kind of opportunities, from pure play investments to strategic sale to mergers," he said.Zigy is planning to raise $15 million (about Rs 100 crore).A few other e-pharmacy chains that ET spoke to, however, said they did not see value in merging with Zigy."There is neither a brand nor anything of significant value for a merger," said one of the founders of an e-pharmacy chain.Analysts said allegations of sexual harassment against Zigy's promoter Murthy in the past also made private equity players wary of investing."Institutional investors are not too comfortable with the founder's past," said a person directly involved in fundraising.Murthy, an alumnus of IIT Madras and IIM Ahmedabad, was sacked by his former employers Infosys and I Gate after allegations of sexual harassment were levelled against him.Zigy, however, said that reports claiming that investors were not coming forward because of allegations against Murthy in the past are untrue.Some analysts said Zigy also suffered from a flawed business model, which involved partly owning a warehouse and partnering with others.Most of the company's peers, however, blamed the "high-handed" approach of the state drug regulators. As the company recovered from the ban on e-pharmacy chains by the Karnataka drug regulator, the Maharashtra government followed suit.The nascent startups are chasing a $1 billion Indian market, but drug regulators do not seem to like the idea of patients buying medicines online.
