A popular vlogger scored a YouTube hit after releasing a video telling men to treat drunk women "the way they deserve".

The video titled "Guy has sex with drunk girl", which has more than 9.1 million views, features NinchiBoy explaining to his fans that drunk women must be treated with respect.

It shows the vlogger enter a room in which a girl, surrounded by bottles of drink, is lay face down on a couch passed out.

As he inspects the bottles, viewers are left on tenterhooks second guessing his next move.

But all is not as it seems, as the vlogger innocently removes her trousers and tucks her in with a sheet.

He then leaves the room - but not before giving her a tender goodnight peck.

In the video, the Spanish vlogger says: "This video is a clear example of how men should treat women.

"It’s done so you can get yourselves together and treat them the way they deserve."

The video started trending in Latin America following a spate of sex attacks on drunken women.

Last month Demonstrators in Brazil and Argentina took to the streets in protest of violence against women in “macho” Latin America.

The rallies were sparked by the alleged gang rape of a 16-year-old in Rio de Janeiro and the murder of a pregnant girl of 14 in Argentina’s Santa Fe province.

But despite the serious tone of NinchiBoy's video, NinchiBoy is best known for his comedy sketches.

He has become a popular Internet figure in his home country of Spain and across Latin America with more than 160,000 subscribers on his YouTube channel.

In one of the most recent videos, he and his show partner lit up a light bulb in their mouth for the amusement of their fans.

In another one, they eat live ants and tell the people watching how they taste.
