Man Gets 40 Years in Jail after Rejecting Plea Deal That Would Have Freed Him Immediately

Houston Chronicle ^ | September 1, 2016 | Conroe Courier

Posted on by BlessedBeGod

A Montgomery County man accused of assaulting a public servant and threatening to kill police officers could have walked free Monday. However, after refusing a plea bargain, he was convicted and hit with a 40-year sentence.

Jurors in the 9th District Court of Judge Phil Grant convicted Raymond Lindsey Jr., 46, last week of Assault on a Public Servant and Retaliation. His attorney said he already had been in jail 19 months and would have been released with "time served..."

He’ll still get credit for the time served, so it’s only 38 and change.

I have a problem with this and I believe it makes a mockery of our treasured legal principal of "innocent until proven guilty." When they can dangle such a massive prison sentence in front of someone and then say, "or just plead guilty and you can go home" I have to wonder how many possibly innocent people accepted this "offer you can't refuse" and now have criminal records. This sounds like something that they would do in China or some other authoritarian country. Not saying this guy is innocent but it's easy to say you would never plead guilty to crime you didn't commit until you are looking at 40 years in prison vice just going home.

The length of sentence is due to previous convictions as well as this one. His choice to turn down the deal was a poor one, but so were his choices to continue to commit crimes. Read the article. There’s no doubt to his guilt.

Read the article. Theres no doubt to his guilt. It's not about his guilt. It's not about this guy at all. It's about the concept of "40 years or go home. Just say what we want to hear." that I find troubling. What if they made the same deal to you, except you knew damn well you were innocent? Would you take their offer or take your chances with a jury?

Not innocent? He assaulted the cop! Now the hypothetical you speak of..yes, perhaps. But I’d rather be home to plot the retribution of those who faulted/framed me then rotting in stir....or perhaps planning a defense to exonerate myself. You would “cut off your nose to spite your face”

He never should have been offered the plea deal to begin with.

I find it troubling that if the guy is obviously guilty of crimes that rate a 40 year sentence, that the DA offered letting him off with 19 months. How does that make sense either? The whole plea bargain game is a crock.

From the article , you get the assumption he was convicted and then given an option to plea. He was first given the option to plea to a lesser charge, then he went to trial. He place his bets badly. But in any event, if you read the article, he will appeal.

“He is very religious and said no man should judge another man,” said Smith, who said Lindsey said he understood the charges and punishment he faced. “That’s another reason I filed a psychological evaluation is because of his thought process. ... He’d use religion to justify actions. The problem was the decisions weren’t going to help him in reality.” “I said the minimum is 25 to life. You’re going to have all of these witnesses come and testify against you and you are not going to have anyone testify for yourself. “He said, ‘

It is what it is.’”

He does know his philosophy. He does know his philosophy. “It depends on what the meaning of the word ‘is’ is. If the—if he—if ‘is’ means is and never has been, that is not—that is one thing. If it means there is none, that was a completely true statement....Now, if someone had asked me on that day, are you having any kind of sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky, that is, asked me a question in the present tense, I would have said no. And it would have been completely true http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/1998/09/bill_clinton_and_the_meaning_of_is.html Beyond that, he is misquoting the Bible. Might be time for some refresher courses. But it is interesting to note the legal response to religion.

And if you take a plea deal you forfeit your right to appeal.

I don’t mind the concept of a plea deal, but it seems like justice is extreme. Time Served is much too short and would have put a dangerous criminal back on the streets. 40 years is much too long. Then again, it seems like many criminals get out early so he may only server a fraction of the sentence. The whole system is screwed up.

He probably knew he would break parole and be jailed for 40 if released.

Please keep sounding the alarm over this, because you are correct. This “between a rock and a hard place” scenario is exactly what has been, and is continuing to happen to our citizens, one by one, across this formerly great nation. Citizens are charged and faced with an unreasonable number of years in prison, when they were innocent, often with eye witnesses documenting their innocence. Nevertheless, state attorneys proceed with bogus charges anyway. Why? It’s another “notch” on their belt, a resume enhancement. See what a tough prosecutor I am? Look at my record of accomplishment. I procured this many convictions/admissions of guilt. Plea deals are offered when the prosecution KNOWS they have a WEAK case. They deliberately put the innocent (yes, innocent because they are innocent until proven guilty) in this no-win situation because they know 99% of people faced with this horrible choice will admit guilt when they are innocent, to avoid a worse fate. It’s easy to pass this EVIL gov’t practice off as hypothetical when in fact it is “just another day at the office” for these gov’t attorneys who perpetrate these outrageous crimes against their fellow citizens. Some may say “Oh, well citizens who know of examples of this happening should report it, or fight back.” That may hypothetically sound like a noble cause, but, when faced with a thoroughly corrupt system filled with corrupt people, sane people recognize the futility of proceeding with that expensive course of action. There is a special place in hell for gov’t attorneys and everyone involved in the whole INjustice system, more accurately named the Legal System in this formerly free republic.

It's about the concept of "40 years or go home. Just say what we want to hear." that I find troubling. Now THAT is real pressure. You're right that extreme plea-bargaining choices like this aren't what justice should be about. It's like picking which door has the Lady and which has the Tiger, not balancing guilt or innocence, or punishment versus court time.

No, the kangaroo court comes later. Plead them to probation, let them go home, and then revoke the probation when you have slight evidence of of minor violation of the terms of probation. Saves the taxpayers a lot of money.

I live in Mont Co, 1st off the new Judge was the 2nd in command prosecutor just last year. Bias against the defendant right there. Plus the cops around here I do not trust 1 bit. Thankfully I’m semi retired and stay home a lot and never ever go out after dark

I retired and left Harris county and Texas almost 2 years ago. My BP and state of mind are much better off now. I believe in law and order but when you can spot 8-10 cops on a 10 mile trip to the grocery store you tend to get paranoid. And I lived in a good part of the county.

This Judge is incompetent. He has the discretion to properly sentence people. The root cause of this problem is the people who elected him / put him in office, but they will never take responsibility, and can hide behind their secret ballot. Voting needs to be a public record.

We had a guy in Buffalo who had been in prison for twenty years for a couple of rapes. He would have been paroled, except he would never personally admit that he had committed the crime. Then, the use of DNA came to be used in crime investigations. The reason he wouldn’t admit guilt was because he was innocent. He was released when they finally caught the real serial rapist/murderer.

Theres no doubt to his guilt. I think you are right, which is why I oppose the idea of offering him a deal that would set him free without a trial.

I'm a retired teacher from a rural county in the Ozarks. I use to take my law class to arraignment day and git to know several judges. One said that over 98% of all felony cases were plea bargained; trials were extremely rare. He said that if 10% went to trial the system couldn't handle the workload.

I also noticed how incestuous the relationships were among the lawyers. In 1 case the defense attorney was the former prosecutor, the judge had been his assistant prosecutor, the prosecutor had been the assistant prosecutor to the judge. I doubt the defendant knew any of this.

Our “justice” system has adopted all the main features of the Nazi system (forcing acceptance of punishment by innocent individuals lest they be subject to draconian alternatives), except that Nazi courts found ten times the number of innocents charged as ours do.

The whole plea bargain game is a crock. Perhaps the DA has political ambitions (Governor?) and wants to run on an impressive conviction record. I understand that another trick is to load up the defendant with everything from the alleged crime down to jaywalking or littering, then say "We'll drop all charges except XYZ if you plead guilty". Maybe I watch too much Investigation Discovery shows, but I often see a Murder One plea bargained down to Manslaughter or Abuse of a Corpse in dismemberment cases.

That is not how it worked. They did not say, “plea guilty and you are free or you will get 40 years in the slammer.” They offered him a plea deal that would let him free. He turned down the plea deal, wanting to take his chances in court. Because of his long criminal history, any court conviction would result in a sentence from 25 years to life in prison. So the perp decided to gamble on a trial jury getting him off, even knowing he was facing at least 25 years if convicted. He was an idiot to not take the plea deal. He clearly committed the crime. My guess is, we are better off with this jackhole behind bars for the next 40 years than out on the street, so thank you Mr. Idiot T. Perp for making this easy on the rest of us and putting yourself behind bars until you are old and gray. Thanks, job well done.

I have a problem with this and I believe it makes a mockery of our treasured legal principal of “innocent until proven guilty.” ******* But he was proven guilty. It’s more likely that the DA offered to let the thug off easy due to political pressure from blacks but he was too dumb to take the deal.

Overcharging seems to be a common way to coerce a plea.

In famous cases (eg, Duke Lacrosse, Zimmerman, the Baltimore police officers/Freddie Gray case), prosecutors often come across as incompetent, dishonest, schemers, etc., and are outmanned by competent defense attorneys. You have to wonder how bad they are normally, since they put their A-Teams on high profile cases. It’s not hard to see why they like forcing poorly represented defendants to plea; it’s easy, quick, low expense, and has a low risk of public embarrassment, plus an appearance of fairness (hey, the defendant agreed to it...). DA’s seem to drop the charges that are complicated. As a result, those looking for injustice can point to convicts serving time for what appears limited offenses, when actually, they were guilty of a large spree. I’ve seen this in local news reports of court action repeatedly — not just TV shows.
