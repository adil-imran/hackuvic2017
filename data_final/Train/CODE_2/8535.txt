AMRITSAR: While declining to form an alliance with Navjot Singh Sidhu-led front Awaz-e-Punjab, Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president Captain Amarinder Singh , without naming Sidhu, said there was no place for indiscipline in Congress party.Talking to media persons here on Tuesday, Amarinder said that former Rajya Sabha MP Sidhu had been violating his own party's discipline "Everyone is welcome to join the Congress without any conditions and has to follow a certain discipline," said PPCC chief.He reiterated that the Awaz-e-Punjab was welcome to merge into the Congress, but there was no possibility of any alliance with it.On the occasion, ruling Shiromani Akali Dal (B) MLA from Amritsar South assembly constituency Inderbir Singh Bolaria and former SAD (B) Amritsar district president Upkar Singh Sandhu joined the Congress.They were inducted into the party by Amarinder Singh in presence of senior leaders including AICC Secretary Harish Chaudhary and MLAs Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, OP Soni, Sukh Sarkaria, Raj Kumar Verka, Mamta Dutta etc.Welcoming the Akali leaders into the Congress, Amarinder said, "This is the beginning of the end for the SAD (B). The exodus from Akali Dal into the Congress has just begun and it will keep on growing till elections".He also indicated that there were several other leaders in touch with Congress party who would be joining in due course.He said, Bolaria had Congress background as his father had worked closely with him in the party before joining the Akali Dal. "It is rather a homecoming for Bolaria", he remarked.Replying to a question Bolaria alleged that the SAD (B) had been reduced to the family fiefdom of Badals and Majithias. He said, "The Akali Dal will soon be decimated as workers and leaders were feeling disillusioned and alienated."Meanwhile, Amarinder condemned the brutal assault on the Congress workers and leaders in Ludhiana. He said, "Congress workers have every right to put up the effigies of Akali leaders for blasting as Raavan as everyone believes the Badals and Majithia to be the embodiment of the evil".He warned that all those responsible for attack on Congressmen would be held accountable once Congress forms the government. "I will avenge each and every assault on my workers," he asserted.
