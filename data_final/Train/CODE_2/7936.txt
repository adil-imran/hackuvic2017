I am surprised they had to pay them.

This is news?

That's why they are called fifth-column leftist media whores.



To: detective

The media say whatever Clinton campaign tells them to say. That's probably true. But, the referenced email doesn't say anything about paying them. The headline is false.



To: detective

This is a bombshell accusation, a new low, even for libtards.but that site is a joke of ads and moving tricks. Who got paid?



To: detective

I saw elsewhere that Brent Budowski of ‚Äúthe Hill‚Äù was working campaign strategy hand-in-hand with Podesta. Always figured him to be a paid Dem shill, but now there‚Äôs cold, hard proof.

To: Carl Vehse

Filthy media have blood on their hands already and will sell us all down the river for money......greed.

And also, in return, our present gestapo IRS will leave them alone.

We all knew about it but this just an OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION. The MSM in this country is worst that a third world country corrupt.



To: detective

Paid them as in 1099 or W-2? Are they disclosed in campaign or other docs? And do these ‚Äújournalists‚Äù have names? Let‚Äôs see how many can be suspended or fired between now and election day if they have been paid propagandists for Clinton.

Add Jason Easily at the Hill to that list .

Everything is a Clinton talking point .

Larry Sabato would be a good bet too.

He hid his employment on the Webb senate campaign while pretending to a pollster..



To: al baby

Rush gets his talking points from Freepers _____________________ Yea, I‚Äôm waiting for my check.



To: detective

Any journalist listed by name in a WikiLeaks release as being Clinton-friendly should be forever barred from any official business with the Trump Administration. And any news organization that has any of the named pro-Clinton people on their payroll should be banned from attending/covering any Trump events until at least 60 days after they‚Äôve released said person from their employ.

So they are getting paid twice. And to think they went to college and end up us just repeating talking points.

I agree false headline..



To: detective

first debate the questions were about her talking points. This last debate was about the tape, yet again her talking points. It is obvious even to a mental midget liberal that the media are working for her.

nobody cares about this.

................... better idea the Republican party needs to publish

a list of what Obamacare costs around the country.

many people don‚Äôt have a clue

because other people pay for them.



To: Parley Baer

"I am surprised they had to pay them." Professional standards. Remember, they are media WHORES.

No evidence of payola. Here‚Äôs better story on the slimy John Harwood:

The RINOs are probably on the Clinton payout list too.

They‚Äôre all voting for her.

There is only one politbureau and they‚Äôre all in the tank with the Clinton money launder machine being replenished frequently by the Jihadi Saudis who attacked us.



To: detective

I‚Äôm surprised they‚Äôd have to pay. Virtually all MSM shills seem more than willing to spew the party line. Of course, when they are used to selling their integrity like common prostitutes, I guess they get used to being paid.

The Democrat agenda is the media‚Äôs agenda, they are ONE



To: mrsmith

What do you mean no evidence of pay... her time is worth ~500k per hour given her speaking fees. Getting ‚Äòinterviews‚Äô with her is the payout... win-win for them.



To: detective

The proof is here. The proof is where. Link to the actual WikiLeaks documents.
