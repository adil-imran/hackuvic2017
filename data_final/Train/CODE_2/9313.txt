Putin Warns ISIS  Obama Warns School District About Girls Shower Room (Some Months afo!!!)

This is a truth that could not make good fiction in a low budget B movie, much less a policy issue in the once most dignified and morally advanced nation the world has ever known.

My first inclination was to title this piece, Obama threatens to spank school district for not favoring a single transgender student.

Too crass, I thought; but along came an article before I got to write word one. It was entitled Complete Anarchy as Obama Invades girls Showers. The subtitle was even more scathing and reads: Feds force school to comply with profoundly stupid rule.

Good online writers hyperlink their important references for safetys sake, but this one had to be connected for the reader whose incredulity would not allow them to believe what they were reading.

NAYO, ===NATO.

This asshat can’t leave soon enough. While the whole world is on the brink of nuclear war, this POS is more concerned with making sure perverts can go into the girl’s rest room. What asshats.

Good next debate question: "Mrs. Clinton, will you use the power of the federal government to force underaged schoolgirls to stand naked in front of males in the girls locker rooms, simply because those males feel feminine that day?" "If not, then what ARE your criteria to force schoolgirls to strip naked in front of biological males, enforced at gunpoint under the law"?

obozo is just setting the stage as he is planning on going back to finally get his High School Diploma.

Meanwhile we are seeing more come out of Fox etc., on how some in the DOJ and FBI that know what has been going on, are becoming more disturbed.

I hate to think of the long lists of things the next administration if it is the Donald are going to have to address and attempt to fix etc..
