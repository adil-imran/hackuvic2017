The Cabinet meeting chaired by new Prime Minister Prachanda at his office in Singha Durbar today nominated Upadhyay as ambassadorial candidate for India and Chief Secretary Lila Mani Poudel for China, Nepalese media reported.Representational image. ReutersUpadhyay, who was serving as Nepal's ambassador to India since April 2015, was suddenly recalled by the erstwhile KP Sharma Oli-led government on 6 May.Upadhyay's nomination comes less than fortnight before Prachanda's maiden visit to India after assuming office last month.The Oli-led government had levelled three charges against Upadhyaya to justify its decision to recall him and officials had said he was working 'against national interest'. "Envoys should follow government's directives and maintain diplomatic decorum," Minister for Defence Bhim Rawal had said after the move.Upadhyaya, a leader of opposition Nepali Congress who was appointed as Nepal's envoy to India in April last year, was being seen as the first casualty of the cancellation of Nepalese President Bidhya Devi Bhandari's planned visit to India.The diplomat was also charged with siding with the Nepali Congress opposition in supporting a threat by the Maoist party led by Prachanda to topple Oli's government. Besides, he was accused of breaching his jurisdiction without informing the government and visiting some western Nepal districts accompanying India's ambassador to Nepal Ranjit Rae, Rawal had said.Pakistan and West Indies in UAE, 3 Test Series, 2016New Zealand in India, 5 ODI Series, 2016Sri Lanka in Zimbabwe, 2 Test Series, 2016England in Bangladesh, 2 Test Series, 2016New Zealand in India, 5 ODI Series, 2016New Zealand in India, 5 ODI Series, 2016Pakistan and West Indies in UAE, 3 Test Series, 2016New Zealand in India, 5 ODI Series, 2016England in Bangladesh, 2 Test Series, 2016New Zealand in India, 5 ODI Series, 2016South Africa in Australia, 3 Test Series, 2016 AUS vs SA - Nov 3rd, 2016, 08:00 AM ISTPapua New Guinea in Hong Kong, 3 ODI Series, 2016 HK vs PNG - Nov 4th, 2016, 07:00 AM ISTPapua New Guinea in Hong Kong, 3 ODI Series, 2016 HK vs PNG - Nov 6th, 2016, 07:00 AM ISTSri Lanka in Zimbabwe, 2 Test Series, 2016 ZIM vs SL - Nov 6th, 2016, 01:00 PM ISTPapua New Guinea in Hong Kong, 3 ODI Series, 2016 HK vs PNG - Nov 8th, 2016, 07:00 AM ISTEngland in India, 5 Test Series, 2016 IND vs ENG - Nov 9th, 2016, 09:30 AM ISTSouth Africa in Australia, 3 Test Series, 2016 AUS vs SA - Nov 12th, 2016, 05:00 AM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 ZIM vs SL - Nov 14th, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTZimbabwe Tri-Nation Series, 2016 SL vs WI - Nov 16th, 2016, 12:30 PM ISTPakistan in New Zealand, 2 Test Series, 2016 NZ vs PAK - Nov 17th, 2016, 03:00 AM IST
