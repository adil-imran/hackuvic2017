Looks like Drake and Rihanna have called it quits…again. After the two made their relationship official back in July with that shark tattoo, sources say Drake broke up with Ri-Ri and the two are now seeing other people. They still love each other but busy schedules got in the way. Allegedly Drake has been hooking up with model India Love but a different source says Drake and Rihanna are still very much together they just have an open relationship. Drake should have some more time on his hands now though after cancelling the remainder of his North American tour due to an ankle injury. He suffered the injury earlier in the tour and despite trying to power through he did more damage and doctors ordered him to cancel the rest of his scheduled tour dates.

The couple showed up to a Vegas chapel and was married by an Elvis impersonator. The two have been together since 2012 but many wondering if they were still involved after a huge fight was caught on tape in Germany.

Shailene Woodley got arrested yesterday for trespassing in North Dakota while she was protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline. She live streamed her entire arrest on Facebook and then spoke out against the pipeline saying: “It’s really actually quite hilarious to me. How can you deny clean water to so many people who are standing up and saying this is what they want? It’s just mind-blowing.” In all 27 people were arrested couple of those were felony.
