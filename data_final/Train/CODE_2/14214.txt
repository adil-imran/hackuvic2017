Forget Milwaukee: Cedar Rapids Had Much Better Black Mob Violence and Denial

American Thinker ^ | 8/18/2016

Posted on by Altura Ct.

You can have Milwaukee.

For the best example of black mob violence and media denial over the last few days, Ill take Cedar Rapids.

People outside of Milwaukee may be a bit surprised that last week hundreds of black people burned down businesses, threw bricks at cops, attacked white people, and created an enormous amount of mayhem. All because police killed a member of that citys black criminal elite after he pointed a stolen gun at them.

The New York Times certainly was -- it even dug up a few locals to say so.

But on the porches of Milwaukee, the home town crowd remember how hundreds of black people rampaged through a recent state fair, attacking white people in and outside of the fairgrounds -- with all the bloody carnage captured on 911 calls.

Other locals remember the White Girl Bleed a Lot beatdown -- that inspired a best seller by the same name! -- and how black racial hostility and denial was on full display there as well.

And of course, just a few weeks ago, large groups of black people in the same area were rioting and throwing rocks at cops and destroying property. All on local TV, all attributed to the troublesome teens. Again.

Others talk about Juneteenth, Racine, Madison and even Green Bay, also sites of recent black mob violence all documented at the Dont Make the Black Kids Angry YouTube channel.

Every porch has a favorite. Aside from reporters and public officials, no one said it was new or even surprising...

...But Ill take Cedar Rapids. The occasion was the St. Judes Sweet Corn Festival on Friday night. Up to 200 black people were rampaging through the fair, knocking over strollers -- with babies in them -- destroying property, fighting, creating mayhem, terrorizing neighbors, and of course, attacking police. One paper got it right, the Cedar Rapids Defender. A few excerpts: There was an air of violence at the St. Jude Sweet Corn Festival Saturday night in Cedar Rapids. What happened next was described as a nightmare and pure chaos by those at the scene. The event attracted mass hordes of teenagers, some claiming to be from Black Lives Matter, loitering about, bickering with rival gangs and threatening violence. A police officer attempting to detain a teenage youth, was subsequently ambushed by dozens of kids, who kicked and stomped, beating him on the ground. The officer who was assaulted, luckily, suffered only minor injuries. Police announced they had detained six juveniles on charges of disorderly conduct and assault on a peace officer. About 150 teenagers were seen running towards the fighting as the police fought back against the mob. The teens had been a disturbance all night as there are reports of racially motivated assaults and items being thrown at police. The words Black Lives Matter came across the CR police scanner according to our overnight crime reporter. One innocent victim was elbowed, stepped on and kicked during the stampede. The rest of the media in Cedar Rapids stuck to the usual script of groups of racially ambiguous children doing all sorts of bad things for no reason whatsoever, other than that is just kids blowing off some steam.

I meant to remind Freepers that Milwaukee’s Mayor, Tom Barrett, was attacked by a thug at our State Fair a number of years ago. Of course, this was before the BLM mayhem he’s dealing with now, but you’d THINK a personal beat-down would’ve changed his tune. They do say a Conservative is a Liberal who’s been mugged! http://onmilwaukee.com/buzz/articles/barrettattacked.html

Black violence works against 'Standard Democrat Lie'... In order to STOP THE TRUTH from coming out the liberal press is being told to surprss stories about black dysfunction. The lie fed to the MSM is that "reporting causes violence". Reporting does NOT cause black violence. Black rage is a result of the liberal culture of dependency inflicted on the black community.

13% vs 73% But it makes me sad. Remmeber the 60s? I used to pray to God as a child that race relations would be resolved by the time I grew up. I guess they want it all over again but the numbers do not add up. Knocking over baby strollers....

This is what you get when you tolerate gangs of Blacks acting like thugs. They thuggish take over and destroy and intimidate and cowardice only encourages them. Perhaps if some adults allowed them to be trapped, then beat them within inches of their lives, this crap would stop. Meet violence with superior firepower and overwhelming violence. That is what they understand. Talking civilly to a rabid dog never ends well. You need to speak to animals in a language that they are capable of understanding. These people do not comprehend civil discussion.

Time to just start shooting to kill. Like it’s going to cause MORE violence than is already happening? These wrist slap measures are NOT working.

I grew up in Milwaukee in the 60’s. Dad moved us out of there in 1970. We moved just north of Madison where campus unrest was in full swing. He took us to see the bombed out Sterling Hall and said, “Girls? Actions like THIS serve no purpose.” He wanted us to understand which side we needed to be on, in any situation. Some things just stick with you, you know? http://www.wiscnews.com/baraboonewsrepublic/news/local/article_74da5325-7a35-5669-aeec-33e6ec66a460.html

federales handled protests at the University of Mexico City. They sent their military in with machine guns to confront the protesters.

The protesters would NOT leave so the army gunned them down, every last one of them.

END OF PROBLEM. . . . But, then who, in his right mind, would want to live in Mexico?

Indeed.

Many of us suffer the confusion of reading about such incidents vs never actually encountering them. Such things are pretty isolated, relative to the vast scale of the country. Life is pretty peaceful, as I write this poolside at a quiet suburb. Hard to imagine such sh!t seriously happening; then again I live in the 6th most redneck town in Georgia, where everyone is nice and intend to d@mn well keep it that way.

I kind of get your point, and hopefully it’s dressed in some sarcasm, but the government in this case IS the problem, and in Mexico that was a totalitarian move.

Certainly not something to be revered.

Every country south of our border has oppressive governments. Those countries are run by a few STINKING rich families who own all the money (banks), politicians, land and military. It's that way in all of Africa and most of Asia. MOST of Europe, North America and Australia stand out as beacons of light in a often-dark world.

“They do say a Conservative is a Liberal whos been mugged!” I don’t believe that axiom. I have a cousin who is a Left-winger. He grew up in the suburbs of Detroit. He was robbed while he was in his apartment by a group of black thugs. It had no effect on his political point of view. Twenty years later, he and his wife were victims of a drive-by shooting in San Diego. He and his family continue to be perpetually left-wing. It takes more than a couple of muggings to change a person’s ideology.

I didnt know it was this bad. Of course not! Soros and his multimillion$ supporting the plan, including the MSM, make sure you stay ignorant. Nobody knows how really bad it is; that is the entire plan! I'm not sure what the end game is, but whatever it is, it will not end well for everyone involved. In including ALM, Soros and any reporter stupid enough to get near any similar battlefields. BTW, what sort of absolute white moron mother would take a baby, in a stroller, to an event that has experienced extreme black violence every year? Twilight Zone stuff.

“I used to pray to God as a child that race relations would be resolved by the time I grew up.” A huge amount of good will among whites has been thrown back in their faces. Why? Well, because a slave doesn’t dream of freedom; a slave dreams of becoming a master. They never wanted justice and equality. They have always wanted their turn on top. They want their turn to be as bad as they think whites have been.
