SRINAGAR: On the India’s Independence Day, yesterday, Dal Khalsa while reasserting that Sikhs want freedom from India, staged a protest demonstration against the atrocities, political subjugation and denial of right to self determination to the Sikh community living in the country.

Dal Khalsa in a statement issued in Ludhiana said that hundreds of party activists along with representatives of various religio-political Sikh bodies held a demonstration in Ludhiana.

The protesters carried black flags, banners and placards to mark August 15, the Indian Independence Day, as Black Day.

The demonstrators chanted the slogans ‘Sikhs want Azaadi from India’ and denounced New Delhi for crushing the rights of Sikhs, Kashmiris and other communities.

Meanwhile, out of fear from public, pro-India National Conference seemed indifferent to the Indian Independence Day celebrations in occupied Kashmir.

“We decided to stay away from the functions as people of Kashmir have now been caged for more than a month and there is no improvement in the situation in the Valley so far,” National Conference General Secretary, Ali Muhammad Saghar, said in an interview in Srinagar.
