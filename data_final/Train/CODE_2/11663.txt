Artist protests naked at Cologne cathedral

thelocal.de ^ | Jan. 8, 2016

Posted on by PROCON



Artist Milo Moire took to the streets naked in 4C temperatures outside Cologne cathedral on Friday in a bid to show women should not be molested under any circumstances.

"Respect us! We are not fair game, even when we're naked," Moire's sign read.

The 32-year-old Swiss artist stood on the square outside Cologne's world-famous cathedral for around 20 minutes on Friday morning, watched by members of the public and a few police officers, who joined the group of onlookers but took no action against MoirÃ©.

"I stand for women's freedom to move freely. For the things we've achieved in the past 50 years â for women's emancipation," MoirÃ© told Bild.

There appear to be more protests from the possible victims than from the "asylum seeker" apologist community.

Not guilty. Batsh!t crazy, perhaps, but not guilty.

Finally! Somebody protesting nekkid who actually looks good nekkid. That is usually NOT the case.

What sign? There’s a sign in that picture? Let me go look again. And again. And again.

We need more Swiss Artists.

Oh lÃ lÃ

And now do this in front of a mosque; the question is, would the police get her before the members of the mosque do?

Serious issue...absolutely silly and worthless stunt.



To: PROCON

I hope she continues to do this when the audience is stone throwing Muslims. But then, of course, the press will be there happily filming her death.



To: Responsibility2nd

LOL

And they likely cropped the pic where they did because any lower would show she has more balls than the males there.

Maybe this will drive some of the Muslims more bat shit crazy than they already are and, this time, they should be shot down as they come. She needs more protection than she is currently wearing. Women and men in Cologne need self defense training and weaponry. The police chief is resigning. The dhimmi Mayor needs to follow.



To: PROCON

I have an urge to protest as well.

There’s another pic at the link that covers her “balls”.

How can you tell? They covered them up with that black bar thingy. =^) CC

I’m pretty sure I would stay warm.

If I had her body, I’d walk around naked, too!



To: PROCON

Great looking woman. She looks like she works out at the gym judging by her muscle definition.



To: tacticalogic; Crazieman

Probably not, but I bet he could at least “stand up” for women’s rights.



To: PROCON

Apparently, posing naked is her thing. Here she is getting arrested in front of the Eiffel Tower. Swiss artist arrested in front of Eiffel Tower for 'naked selfie performance'



To: PROCON

What is she protesting? Never mind, it doesn’t matter.



To: Vigilanteman

Finally! Somebody protesting nekkid who actually looks good nekkid. That is usually NOT the case. My thoughts exactly. I've learned to resist the urge to look at these "naked" protests but, for once, it's worth checking out. By the way, I first saw this story over at breitbart.com where they have a bit more "extensive" coverage. Just in case anyone's interested in further admiring this young lady's ..uh.. courageous protest.



To: Maceman

I read that too. I guess flaunt it while you still got it, and get publicity.



To: PROCON

What a country.

Not guilty.

Of anything.

Ever.

Do a picture search... just not at work.

Poor thing. A starving artist so bad off she can’t afford clothes.

To: Crazieman

Thats a cause I could get behind.

To: eCSMaster

YES, Not guilty, indeed, can we ask Laz on his opinion.



To: ConfusedAndLovingIt

It was tempting not to look at it, also she is a nice good looking dark haired Swede :).



To: Maceman

Is it Lunchtime already?



To: Lazamataz

Ping.



To: the_individual2014; Lazamataz

Nah, Laz would not try anything with her. She’s way too pretty.

Laz likes them fat and ugly. A whole lot less work and way less expensive.

"By the way, I first saw this story over at breitbart.com where they have a bit more "extensive" coverage. Just in case anyone's interested in further admiring this young lady's ..uh.. courageous protest." Indeed, and she is really not guilty. She could be used by a more forceful police force to attract Muslim terrorists for miles and miles and then the scum could be removed from German society (if only).



To: McGruff

I wonder who was more aroused, Putin or Merkel?



To: eCSMaster

Yeah, but she's not a fun crazy. More likely one of those angry crazy people. A feminist harpy tediously railing about the injustice of it all, non-stop. Looks can be worked on, but you can't fix crazy.



To: wbill

>> you can’t fix crazy. I dunno; I don’t think it would be a total waste of time to at least TRY a frontal lobotomy...

To: PROCON

Naked with a gun gets more attention than just naked. But she’s still very not guilty.
