Abuja—The Police Service Commission, PSC, has approved the dismissal of six officers for various offences ranging from impersonation, forgery, negligence, insubordination and disobedience to lawful order.

The dismissals, which were part of the decisions taken by the Commission on 55 disciplinary cases brought before it, came as the Commission also rejected the recommendation for special promotion of one DSP and one Inspector and returned the recommendation for the appointment of a Deputy Commissioner of Police to Commissioner of Police on acting capacity for proper presentation.

The PSC also withheld the special promotion of nine other senior officers for failure to provide convincing reasons for such promotions.

Confirming the developments yesterday in Abuja, Ikechukwu Ani, Head of Information and Public Relations, said the Commission approved promotion of four Deputy Commissioners of Police to the next rank.

The new Commissioners of Police are Posi E Ajunwa, Akinsanmi Francis Ayo, Kenneth Ebrimson and Akpoebi Agberebi Egbuson, one time Force Public Relations Officer.

According to Ani: ”The Commission also approved the promotion of 17 Assistant Commissioners of Police to Deputy Commissioners and 78 Chief Superintendents of Police to Assistant Commissioners of Police.

“The Commission also endorsed the promotions of one Superintendent of Police to Chief Superintendent of Police; 12 Deputy Superintendents of Police to Superintendent of Police and one Assistant Superintendent of Police to Deputy Superintendent of Police.

“Two Chief Superintendents were appointed Assistant Commissioners on Acting capacity; two Superintendents to Acting Chief Superintendents; two Deputy Superintendents to Acting Superintendents; six Assistant Superintendents to Acting Deputy Superintendents and 12 Inspectors to acting Assistant Superintendents.”

The spokesman added that the promoted Commissioners of Police earlier, yesterday, appeared before the Commission in Plenary, where they were subjected to questions on the Change Agenda of the Police Force.
