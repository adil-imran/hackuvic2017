LeEco's Epic 919 SuperFan festival received an overwhelming response during its 24-hour sale. Following popular demand, the company decided to extend its online shopping carnival, which was supposed to end at 11.59 pm on Monday, till Tuesday midnight. This gives a second chance to shoppers who missed out on the deals and discounts on LeEco smart TVs, smartphones and accessories on day one.

The company has not changed deals offered throughout Sept. 19. The Chinese conglomerate also revealed that its half-day sales of Super TVs during Epic 919 exceeded the total sales recorded during the 3-day Independence Day sale last month.

The sale will be live until Sept. 20, 11.59 pm on both LeMall and Flipkart online stores. For those who are unaware, below is the list of deals and discounts available on LeEco Super3 smart TV series, Le 2, Le Max 2, Le 1s Eco and mobile phone accessories:
