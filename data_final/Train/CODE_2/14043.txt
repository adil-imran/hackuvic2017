Clifford, W.L.: My Fellow Americans, Hillary Clinton is a vile, evil, lying, thieving, cunning, conniving, corrupt, crooked, disgusting, deceiving, fraudulent, phony, repulsive, repugnant, slimy, sleazy, wretched, socialist/Marxist/commie/liberal Democrat COCKROACH. Much like that lying, little sonofa(bi)tch, Barack Hussein Obama. And Bill Clinton IS a PROVEN sexual predator. Just ask Monica. And Hillary IS Bill’s enabler. “I don’t celebrate this. I don’t say it as a way of demonizing the president or casting an aspersion on him––but the data is going to indicate …that black people lost ground in every single leading economic category during the Obama years.” - Tavis Smiley, 09/12/2014 “Credibility in immigration policy can be summed up in one sentence: those who should get in, get in; those who should be kept out, are kept out; and those who should not be here will be required to leave. The top priorities for detention and removal, of course, are criminal aliens. But for the system to be credible, people actually have to be deported at the end of the process.” – U.S. Representative Barbara Jordan, D-TX, Chair, U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, 02/24/1995 "Illegal immigration costs U.S. taxpayers about $113 BILLION a year at the federal, state and local level. The bulk of the costs — some $84 BILLION — are absorbed by state and local governments." - "The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on United States Taxpayers", Federation For American Immigration Reform (FAIR), 2013 The U.S. Labor Participation rate has fallen to less than 63%, the lowest in nearly 40 years. 95 MILLION Americans are unemployed, under employed or have given up looking for work. As a U.S. Senator, Hillary Clinton’s ONLY legislative accomplishment in 6 years was getting a U.S. Courthouse re-named in honor of Thurgood Marshall. 1. "I made a mistake. I'm not making any excuses," - Hillary Clinton. Mistake?? Yeah, right, and monkeys might fly out of Obama’s @-- too. Hillary Clinton DELIBERATELY, INTENTIONALLY, WITH MALICE and with EXTREME, GROSS NEGLIGENCE, BETRAYED and LIED to the American people, our children and grandchildren, our nation and jeopardized the National Security of the United States by using a STUPID, UNSECURED, ‘HOME BREWED’ SERVER and SECRET and CONFIDENTIAL, UNSECURED emails sent around the world in order to EVADE Federal Freedom of Information laws. 2. Hillary Clinton has been a liar and a fraud to the American people for over three decades. 3. Hillary Clinton wouldn't know Jesus Christ if He kicked her in the @--. 4. Hillary Clinton wouldn't know a Free Market / Supply and Demand Economy if it bit her in the @--. 5. Hillary Clinton got three American heroes and a U.S. Ambassador killed in Benghazi, Libya and then blamed their tragic murders on a stupid video. 6. Hillary Clinton used her position as Secretary of State to ‘solicit’ donations for the Clinton Foundation, i.e., ‘Pay for Play’. 7. Hillary Clinton, besides being evil, is stupid and can't even do 4th grade math, …especially when it comes to growing our nation’s economy. 8. BOTH the Socialist and Communist Parties of the U.S. ENDORSED Barack Hussein Obama AND Hillary Clinton for President and NEITHER Barack Hussein Obama nor Hillary Clinton disavowed or repudiated these disgusting, ‘goofball’ organizations. 9. Hillary Clinton is nothing but a deadly, poisonous pit viper snake in a pants suit. 10. Do you REALLY want another four years of Barack Hussein Obama, …on STEROIDS?? Would you rather, God forbid, that we have to go to war with a National DEBT of $20 TRILLION OR a National SURPLUS of $4 TRILLION?? Ask ANY of our nation’s military leaders, PAST OR PRESENT. "The most significant threat to our national security is our debt …and the reason I say that is because the ability for our country to resource our military -- and I have a pretty good feeling and understanding about what our national security requirements are -- is going to be directly proportional -- over time, not next year or the year after, but over time -- to help our economy. That's why it's so important that the economy move in the right direction, because the strength and the support and the resources that our military uses are directly related to the health of our economy over time." – Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen, CNN 08/27/2010 “I haven’t changed my view that the continually increasing debt is the biggest threat we have to our national security,” – Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen, Washington Post 08/11/2011 As the WORLD’S ONLY SUPER POWER, we must ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS be prepared to confront EVIL at a moment’s notice. The choice is YOURS. The National DEBT as of 10/31/2016, $19.8 TRILLION. Without a doubt, YES! We DO have a National DEBT CRISIS. Without a Declaration of War, every single day that the National DEBT increases is another day of damning lies, fraud, betrayal, moral failure AND economic treason by the President AND the Congress of these United States to the American people, our children and grandchildren. PERIOD. Never, ever should the National DEBT be increased/suspended, nor should taxes, fees or penalties be increased on the American people without a 3/5 majority (60%) approval of BOTH Houses of Congress. “Debt is nothing but borrowing prosperity from the future. If we want it now, such as all the “free” governmental programs, we have to borrow it from the future. No matter what Bernie told you, there is no “free lunch.”” – Bert Dohmen, Forbes, 09/29/2016, “Is The Inevitable Debt Collapse Predictable?” This WILL require MASSIVE, MASSIVE, SUPER MASSIVE National SPENDING REFORM. This WILL require MASSIVE, MASSIVE, SUPER MASSIVE National TAX REFORM. The two, combined together, WILL create MASSIVE, MASSIVE, SUPER MASSIVE National DEBT REFORM. ALL Federal spending, every single damn dollar, whether you are a Democrat OR whether you are a Republican, can ALL be CLASSIFIED, and MORE importantly, MUST be PRIORITIZED into just FOUR SPENDING categories. And EVERY damn politician out there knows EXACTLY what those SPENDING PRIORITIES are. And if they don’t, then they’re just a bunch of blithering, bloviating, bed wetting, stupid fools and shouldn’t even be running for DOG CATCHER. Our SPENDING PRIORITIES are and ALWAYS will be: 1. Principal and Interest on the $20 TRILLION of DUMB, IRRESPONSIBLE and UNSUSTAINABLE National DEBT being dumped ‘onto the backs of our children and grandchildren’. (This INCLUDES monies owed to the Social Security and Medicare Entitlement TRUST FUNDS ‘borrowed’ [embezzled] by the Federal government.) 2. National DEFENSE / Veterans Benefits / Homeland Security 3. Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches of the Federal Government 4. Entitlement spending (Medicaid, Unemployment, Food stamps) Abortions, illegal aliens, Medicaid, welfare, unemployment, food stamps and those other wonderful, noble endeavors and 'entitlement' programs MUST be funded by the states, state tax payers and by the kind, generous and MASSIVE, MASSIVE, SUPER MASSIVE donations of the American people INSTEAD of TRILLIONS, UPON TRILLIONS, UPON TRILLIONS of MASSIVE, MASSIVE, SUPER MASSIVE, DUMB, IRRESPONSIBLE and UNSUSTAINABLE National DEBT being DUMPED ‘onto the backs of our children, grandchildren’ by the Federal government. Just like the Smithsonian Museum saving Dorothy’s ‘Ruby Red Slippers’ from the ‘Wizard of Oz’ movie. Put out a call for DONATIONS. Run those PSA (public service announcements) asking for donations on late night cable television like every other wonderful and noble cause does. Demand these changes from your U.S. Senators and Congressional Representatives, ...NOW!! “It’s the economy, STUPID!” – James Carville, Democratic Strategist Things I trust more than Hillary Clinton 1. Mexican tap water 2. A rattlesnake with a “pet me” sign 3. Congress to control spending 4. OJ Simpson showing me his knife collection 5. Picking up a hitchhiker in a hockey mask. 6. An elevator ride with Ray Rice 7. Taking pills offered by Bill Cosby 8. Michael Jackson’s Doctor 9. An Obama Nuclear deal with Iran 10. A Jimmy Carter economic plan 11. Anthony Weiner with a free data plan 12. Prayers for peace from Al Sharpton 13. Playing Russian Roulette with a semi-auto pistol 14. Rosie O showing restraint at an all-you-can-eat buffet 15. Government run healthcare 16. Barack Obama saying, "If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor." 17. Bill Clinton claiming he's a virgin 18. Bernie Madoff with my money 19. A blind date with a woman named Caitlyn 20. Used car salesman 21. The Russian, Chinese and U.S. governments 22. The main stream media 23.
