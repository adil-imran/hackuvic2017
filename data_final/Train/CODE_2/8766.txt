PLAYERS of the numbers games in the country are encouraged to “go legal” as President Rodrigo Duterte is planning to focus on the war against illegal gambling next year.

Jose Jorge Corpuz, Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) chairman, gave this advise to all the numbers games players during the PCSO’s turnover ceremony yesterday of four brand new ambulances to the Cebu provincial government at the PCSO-Cebu office at Pier 4, Cebu City.

Corpuz said Duterte would want to promote legal numbers game such as small-town lottery (STL) as a means to generate revenue.

“There will be no illegal gambling. And (we will) promote small-town lottery (STL) as the only legal numbers game … It will not be bloody, but it will be exciting because (there will be) more competition,” said Corpuz.

He also said that the current administration is open to numbers games.

But he clarified that these should be legal, and the operators and players should pay their taxes.

“Are we promoting gambling? We are promoting legal means to get revenue for the government,” he said.

Corpuz cited the revenues earned by PCSO from SLTs to emphasize its importance as a revenue generator.

“We have 18 (STL) operators all over the country. And in one month, they accumulated P539 million. To think that as low as P2.50, anyone can play in legal numbers games,” he said.

Corpuz said 30 percent of PCSO’s profit from STL and other numbers games would go to charity.

“And the four brand new ambulances we will give to Cebu is just part of the 30 percent of charity,” he said.

The ambulances, which are the C1 models from China-based car-manufacturing company Foton, will be given directly to selected district hospitals in cities of Talisay, Carcar and two still unnamed areas.

Davide, who thanked Corpuz for the donation, said the ambulances served as an “early Christmas gift” for the provincial government.

The Cebu Provincial Government also received their share of income, which was earned in the first half of the year, from STLs around Cebu province.

Corpuz turned over a cheque worth P1.1 million to Davide and 44 cheques worth P500,000 to representatives of towns and cities of the province.
