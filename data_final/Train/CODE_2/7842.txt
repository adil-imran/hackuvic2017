The Coming National Gun Ban  and How the States Can Resist

American Thinker ^ | 11 Oct, 2016 | Michael Filozof

Posted on by MtnClimber

The law of averages predicts that at some time in the future, perhaps as soon as 2017, the Democratic Party will once again control the White House and majorities in both houses of Congress. When that happens, the next Democratic president -- be it Hillary Clinton or someone else -- will sign into law a sweeping, foreign-style gun ban.

The legislation has already been written. H.R. 4269 would enact a national, permanent ban on the manufacture and sale of so-called assault weapons and all firearm magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds. The bill, introduced last December, already has149 Democratic co-sponsors (218 are needed to pass the House).

H.R. 4269 would ban all AR-15 and AK-type rifles and all civilian versions of military rifles produced anywhere in the word within the past 60 years or so. The bill would also ban all parts kits, stripped receivers, bump-fire stocks, thumbhole stocks, trigger cranks, so-called compliant rifles, and any characteristic that can function as a [pistol] grip. Law enforcement is exempt from the bills provisions.

They want more gun control for law abiding citizens and shorter sentences for crimminals.

It will only create a MAD MAX landscape of weaponized tools and vehicles, harpoons, crossbows, air cannons, trebuchets.

I would have said a week ago there is no way we lose the House and likely would hold the Senate by at least a couple seats, but the DC political class just declared civil war. Idiots.

One of the sheriffs in the Ozark Mtns said that he’d deputized every non-felon citizen in the county, starting with Form 4 ATF holders, CHCL holders, and FFLs etc. as a sure fire way to bypass federal laws since CLEOs are exempt.

Some old wise men, a long time ago, wrote a guidebook for free people called The Constitution of the United States. Conservatives strongly believe what they wrote because it has worked quite well for over 200 years. The Moderates would like to change it a bit, and the Democrats, believers in communism, would like to destroy it. Those who make peaceful revolution impossible, make violent revolution inevitable.JFK The rifle is the weapon of democracy If guns are outlawed, only the government will have guns, only the police, the secret police, the military, the hired servants of our rulers. Only the governmentand a few outlaws. I intend to be among the outlaws. -Edward Abbey

Granted the wording of that line could be interpreted both ways. I would like to see it change to something more empowering to the state or making it more obvious that those that are exempted by the US MAY also be exempted by the State.

those in DC and those who own them obviously fear an armed citizenry even though the UC citizen has and still complies with their anti-constitutional anti-second amendment laws. People do change with the right kind of encouragement, especially when they feel their own lives and their family’s lives are being threatened. History repeats.

They have no inkling the damage a competent rifleman with an old bolt-action Enfield, Moisin-Nagant or Springfield can do, one shot at a time.

I have put away enough money that on November 9th I am either buying more ammo or more weapons and more ammo. My wife said enough is enough with the gun buying and the accidents on the lake. Hate to tell her this, but she needs to take her head out of the sand.

I really wish I had bought a case of M-Gs in cosmoline when they were $50 apiece. That and a few thousand rounds, and you have provided basic equipment for a fireteam for $500-$600.

I truly believe we wouldn't have this problem to worry about (and many others) if we could find some way rescind the 17th. amendment.... The Senators we send to Washington think they work for the federal government rather then the state that elected them... Maybe we need a law that says NO Senator can accept money from someone from another State.... Hell, maybe there is a law against it and they just don't enforce it...

Fellow FReepers, never underestimate the evil that is rapidly overwhelming the world and attempting to destroy America. As these kind of stories come out and are posted on FR, I for one would encourage you to remember that there are people out there right now who are watching and taking notes on every publicly expressed opinion. There will probably come a day when we will have to fight to keep what little freedom we have left.

But... Remember, there’s a Selective Service bill that was set aside, waiting for a vote until after Hillary “is elected,” decreeing that all women 18-30 must now enlist. Word to the wise gals: She ain’t in this for YOU. Vote for her and you’ve got a big surprise coming.

How about what a competent hunter wielding a modern bolt action rifle can do? The kind that shoots flat to 400 yards or more using state of the art optics. IMO it was hunters that Adm. Yamamoto meant when he said `there will be a rifle behind every blade of grass’. It is hunting rifles that the U.N. small arms commission wants to rename “medium range sniper weapons” & have them banned. Won’t be a new civil war in my view but rather a low intensity insurgency.

Name any place in the US where bans have worked. Even mild Canada said no to registration (the precursor to confiscation). I just dont see anythig coming from DC as viable. They might try but in the end itll fail.



To: MtnClimber



I was actually reviewing this bill last night and observed that mini-14s and mini-30s were exempt ( appendix A-exempted weapons ). I found that interesting. I also found it interesting that it will prohibit threaded barrels which ought to be unlawful as it prevents the attachment of suppressors which will remain perfectly legal. I think there is a case to be made there that this provision is an end run around the 1934 National Firearm act and, therefore, possibly unconstitutional.

To: MtnClimber; All

I was harping on this bill repeatedly, a few months ago.

The response / interest — if posts responding to mine count for anything—

was zero. Crickets.

How many of you have actually read this bill? Link below. Or called, or written your congresscritters?

Hmmmm?

Don’t just call your repubbies; harass your democrats as well, with calls and letters.

The bill, cosponsored by virtually all democrats in the house, would criminalize POSSESSION of dozens of guns you CURRENTLY own, in addition to future purchase, manufacture, import, etc.

THIS IS TRULY A GUN CONFISCATION BILL.

And the bill goes far beyond so-called “assault weapons.”

It includes a very, very scary-ass long LIST of various commonly owned guns, the POSSESSION of which would be outlawed.

Read the bill. SIGN UP for UPDATES, so you’ll know when it moves forward, and you can keep the heat on your congress.

The OP is correct—if we get a democrat POTUS and majority, it might actually pass. We cannot allow this.

The stakes are huge. https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4269/text I find it very hard to believe we will take up arms and fight later, if we won’t even pick up a pen or a telephone now.

They figure that they won’t have to come and take them if they simply ban the transfer of any firearm. They will wait until you die and then take them.

Only way the States can survive the Corrupt Clinton Presidency is to Leave the UNION—Forge a new CSA (Constitutional States of America—this time) The new nation could name Donald Trump as its President—and Newt as her VP. Who would go out? Texas for one. Most of the south, and some of the west. First thing to do is seize the nukes and threaten to destroy Washington DC if they should resist—Think of it as a form of Urban Renewal. Flag? How about the Rattlesnake flag of the Revolution? “Don’t Tread on Me” is a good motto—That or the “Come and Take it” Flag.

The dems can have wet dreams about a federal gun ban... We are still 50 sovereign states and they can pass any law they want out of DC... It won’t be obeyed or enforced by the vast majority of citizens and law enforcement... Your local sheriff going to knock on every gun owners door to collect your illegal weapon?

DC could probably take control remotely and either render them inert or launch them themselves. I’d certainly have that kind of contingency installed. How would they be accessed anyway?

The precedent for secession is civil war. I prefer expulsion because there is no precedent. Expel the most liberal parts of our country, and let them fend for themselves. Many of them are rich, but that is money looted from America’s Heartland and other working Americans. Start with DC, Hawaii, Maryland (my residence, sadly), Vermont, California, Massachusetts, and continue down the list starting with the most liberal until the remainder is a reliably law-abiding free country rather than the socialist hellhole that Hillary wants to inflict on us. I don’t care whether we expel ten sates and forty stay, or the reverse. What matters is leaving a country that honors the literal Constitution and that can pass strict laws on immigration and banning government involvement with the greed and envy of liberal class warfare instigators. We’ll see if the expelled states come crawling back after all their productive people flee to the free states, begging us to take them on our terms (with the literal Constitution and limited government) or not. I’m okay either way.

If the Democrats take the Congress and White House and this bill is introduced, expect it to fail or be withdrawn! Then there will suddenly be a mass killing in which the shooter will use an AR-15. The shooter will conveniently also kill himself or be shot dead. The bill will quickly be brought out and passed before you can get your pants on! This is how California got their anti-gun laws passed after the Stockton shootings.

***They have no inkling the damage a competent rifleman with an old bolt-action*** Yes they do! This is why Thomas J Dodd and Emanuel Cellar called for a ban on the import of 5 shot bolt action army surplus rifles. They got their ban in 1968. Actually they wanted the ban to protect local high dollar industries, Remington, Winchester, Savage from cheap $10.00 imported rifles.
