On the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Hangzhou, China, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday held bilateral talks with his Australian counterpart Malcolm Turnbull.

The PM tweeted saying that he met Turnbull and discussions were held on India-Australia relationship and ways to strengthen the ties between the two countries.

The PM tweeted, “Delighted to meet PM @TurnbullMalcolm. We discussed aspects of India-Australia relations & how to strengthen them.”

The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) tweeted, “Bilateral meetings continue…PM @narendramodi & PM @TurnbullMalcolm discuss India-Australia relations.”

The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said that PM Modi thanked PM Turnbull for Australia’s continuous support for India’s bid for NSG. It added that the PM also said that a unified approach was needed to counter the scourge of terrorism. An invitation was extended by PM Modi to Australian PM Malcom Turnbull and he is likely to visit India sometime next year, added the MEA.

MEA official spokesperson, Vikas Swarup, tweeted saying, “Advancing an important partnership. PM @narendramodi & Australian PM @TurnbullMalcolm meet in Hangzhou.”

The meeting comes just days after the leak of information on the Scorpene submarines by the Australian media.

Over 22,000 pages of top secret data on the capabilities of six highly-advanced submarines being built for the Indian Navy in Mumbai in collaboration with the French company, DCNS, have been leaked.

The meeting is a follow-up on the progress made following Prime Minister Modi’s visit to Australia in November 2014. India and Australia have several commonalities, which serve as a foundation for closer co-operation and multifaceted interaction on lines similar to what New Delhi has developed with the other western countries.
