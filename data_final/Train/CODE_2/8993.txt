God bless, Martha Raddatz, the winner of the second presidential debate.



Throughout the bewildering experience that was Sunday night’s presidential debate, Raddatz’s performance as co-moderator with Anderson Cooper was a beacon of hope.

Here are some of Raddatz’s finest moments from the debate:



Y'all, watching @MarthaRaddatz do her thing is magical. MAGICAL. She can't deal with the stupidity. #Debates2016 - shonda rhimes (@shondarhimes) October 10, 2016

1. When she pressed Trump to "answer the question."

2. When she pushed back on Trump about U.S. military presence in Mosul.

At one point, Trump criticized the U.S. government for warning residents of the Iraq city of Mosul that it planned to attack ISIS militants in the city.

Trump: Why do they have to say we’re going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they’re saying? How stupid is our country?

Raddatz: There are sometimes reasons the military does that. Psychological warfare.

Trump: I can’t think of any. I can’t think of any. And I’m pretty good at it.

Raddatz: It might be to help get civilians out.

Trump: "I can't think of any good reasons."



Moderator Martha Raddatz: "It may be to save innocent civilian lives."

3. When she told the audience to chill.

Although audience members were told not to react to the candidates’ answers, they still erupted into applause or laughter after a handful of responses. At point, Raddatz had had enough. "And really, the audience needs to calm down here," she said.

4. When she pushed Trump for actual policy details.



During the same exchange - which was prompted by a question about what the U.S. government should do in Syria - Raddatz pushed back on Trump, saying, "Tell me what your strategy is."

"Tell me what your strategy is," Raddatz says, Trump ignores the question and keeps rambling about how great he is. - Adam Servianski (@AdamSerwer) October 10, 2016

5. When she repeated the question for Trump.

6. When she asked Hillary Clinton whether it was OK for politicians to be "two faced."

Ahead of the debate, Wikileaks released transcripts of Clinton’s paid speeches, which she has refused to make public. Referring to a question from a voter, Raddatz pointed to a section of the transcript where she apparently remarks on having a public stance and a private stance on certain issues.

"So, Tu (ph), from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced?" she asked.



Pretty sure Martha Raddatz just called Clinton "two-faced" - Josh Lederman (@joshledermanAP) October 10, 2016

7. When she had zero time for Trump’s complaining.
