FLASHBACK: Finally! Monica Lewinsky Is Reportedly Prepared To Detail How She Tossed Bill (tr)

Posted on by TigerClaws

So Monica Lewinsky is reportedly peddling a memoir about her White House career, promising tawdry details that did not appear in Monicas Story, the 1999 authorized biography authored by Andrew Morton.

As reported by the New York Post, the tell-all will describe Bill Clintons purported penchant for kinky sex.

Which means Lewinsky, 39, is prepared to talk about tossing the 42nd presidents salad.

While the report prepared by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr provides a thorough account of Clintons sexual encounters with Lewinsky, some salacious details were redacted from the report prior to its release by the House Judiciary Committee.

For example, the document includes the transcript of Lewinskys August 1998 sworn deposition by Starr investigators. At one point, the ex-intern was asked, On that date did you gratify him in some way other than performing oral sex? While Lewinskys answer to that question--Yes"--was included in the transcript, six follow-up questions (and Lewinskys answers) were excised from the transcript.

However, Lewinskys description of how she gratified Clinton can be gleaned from the transcripts unredacted digest, which includes an alphabetized list of all key words that appear in the Lewinsky deposition. Next to each entry in the digest appears the deposition page and line in which the word appears.

After Lewinsky acknowledged the other-than-oral-sex gratification, she was asked a question (page 20, line 3) that included the words anus, mouth, orally, and stimulate. A follow-up question (page 20, line 12) included the words anus and orally.

By the time Lewinsky was deposed, she had already been interviewed extensively by FBI agents and Starr staffers. Which allowed prosecutors to subsequently question her under oath about some of her more explicit revelations during those sessions with federal investigators.

I apologize posting something this disgusting, but it makes a point. These are the folks who are offended by Trump's comments? About consensual ("they let you") copping a feel? Feminists traditionally say given the great disparity in power between the two this would be rape. Where's the great outrage over Clinton's actions?

I could not contemplate doing something like that without drinking bleach after.

Regardless of the fact that i haven’t watched them in over a year, the only msm website i can stomach is fox news. yeah, i know they’ve been outed as not conservative. But their news site still bashes clinton and mentions all the things the others dont, like wikileaks, Trump’s best debate lines, etc.

The whole Lewinski affair is a non-event because oral sex is not sex. Bill Clinton said so and Hillary agrees to that fact.

Oh, Man! Getting this woman back into the fray is going to be the Cherry on Top! The ‘Rats have NO IDEA how their dirty tricks have backfired. I LOVE that Mr. Trump fights fire with Nuclear Weaponry! Yeah, it’s tawdry; but This Is War. We can be Victorians again AFTER we’re Victorious. ;)

Is this story four years old? Blowinski hasn’t been 39 for four years.

But LYING about it will get you IMPEACHED! Why doesn’t Trump hammer THAT home as well? The WIFE of a President who has been IMPEACHED is running for President? How is that even POSSIBLE? *SMIRK*

“We can be Victorians again AFTER were Victorious.” Let’s hope we are victorious. It’s not looking great right now and there isn’t much time left.

From Item #89 of the Starr Report: ” The President and Ms. Lewinsky had ten sexual encounters that included direct contact with the genitalia of at least one party, and two other encounters that included kissing. On nine of the ten occasions, Ms. Lewinsky performed oral sex on the President. On nine occasions, the President touched and kissed Ms. Lewinskys bare breasts. On four occasions, the President also touched her genitalia. On one occasion, the President inserted a cigar into her vagina to stimulate her. The President and Ms. Lewinsky also had phone sex on at least fifteen occasions.” http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/icreport/7groundsfoot.htm

If those gutless Republican’s did their job and removed Clintigula from office like he deserved - we wouldnt be dealing with Hitlery today and who knows, there may even be more respect for the rule of law in our government today. Bonus points would be that the thought of a President Obama would have never seen the light of day.

If Hillery gets elected, Monica won’t be publishing anything. She’ll be running for her life.

One of the biggest lies in the history of the world is that Bill Clinton only got oral sex from Lewinsky. That was just the lie they came up with so that Bill could then claim that when he testified in a deposition that he had not had sex with Monica, he hadn’t committed perjury, because he didn’t consider oral sex to be sex. Clinton couldn’t deny being gratified by Monica because of the blue dress and its stain, but he could come up with a story about how it got there. They got to Monica and told her what to say and told her to play ball and she did. Bill then gave an entire generation of teenage girls license to blow their boyfriends without feeling guilty.

Kinda puts a new perspective on the ol ESAD (for you non Military folks Eat Shit And Die) If you are just passing a simple yet complete message ESAD ... it would be complete... Message sent.

If you Announce ESAD or Command it, it is usually followed with the standard MF as a modifier instead of the regular or passe “asshole” as that would be redundant.

Military communication etiquette has nuances that civilians will never understand.
