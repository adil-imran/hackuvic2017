You cannot use Boko Haram approach against militants, Ijaw group warns Buhari

Delta - The Ijaw National Congress (INC) has warned President Buhari against the deployment of troops in combating restive youths in the Niger Delta region according to the Nation.



The Nation reports that the INC, a socio-cultural organisation of the Ijaw ethnic nationality in the Niger Delta, advocated that dialogue remains the best option for a peaceful resolution of the Niger Delta crisis.

The INC speaking on the backdrop of the recently launched military campaign, “Operation Crocodile Smile”, which has seen massive deployment of troops to the Niger Delta region, rejected the use of force against restive youths.

President of the group, Boma Obuoforibo, faulted calls by those advocating for the Boko Haram approach against restive youths.

Obuoforibo, during a press briefing in Port Harcourt, the Rivers state capital, on Sunday, September 11, said Niger Delta youths’ demand for equity, fairness and justice, could not be termed terrorism.

He called on President Muhammadu Buhari to disregard the calls for military campaign against the restive youths, warning that such approach would aggravate the crisis in the region.

He said: “The Federal Government cannot use the same Boko Haram approach against our youths; we disagree with that. The use of force is unnecessary because the leadership of INC is engaging the restive youths at various levels to embrace peace.

“One major reason the Niger Delta crisis has lingered on without any meaningful solution is insincerity on the part of the successive governments and the operators of the oil sector. We are calling on President Buhari not to listen to the call of adoption of military force in the region.”

President Buhari had vowed to deal with Niger Delta militants like it has done to Boko Haram insurgents, unless they agree to dialogue according to News24.



He made the remark at a bilateral meeting with Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, on the sidelines of the sixth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD), in Nairobi, Kenya, last month.,
