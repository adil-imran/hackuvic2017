NEW DELHI: Taking a long-awaited step towards the realisation of Digital India , a high level committee (HLC) submitted a report for transformation of the National Informatics Centre, the technology infrastructure arm of the government.The committee, which was headed by Infosys cofounder Kris Gopalakrishnan , was constituted in December last year, and made its recommendations to IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Monday.The committee has made several suggestions for "transformation of NIC to NIC 2.0". The redefined vision of NIC 2.0 is "to be the technology think-tank and trusted technology partner of the government" and "play a key role in architecting, designing and developing the core information assets of the nation".Transforming NIC has been in the works since the past two years. The Digital India blueprint , released in August 2014, had identified the NIC as a top human resource challenge in the implementation of the ambitious programme. "NIC — not equipped for a fraction of this task (obsolesce) — needs revamping & restructuring," it said.NIC's role is crucial, considering it is responsible for building most of the e-governance applications of the government at the Centre, state and district levels.The HLC redefined the objectives and functions of NIC in a 10-page presentation. It said NIC 2.0 will continue as an attached office, and focus on architecture, design and strategic control of large service delivery projects. The committee also encourages NIC to partner with the private sector, and develop an action plan to promote research in e-governance and internal collaboration.It has stressed the need to for NIC 2.0 to "maintain pyramidal structure", have direct recruitment at middle levels, and make provisions for professionals from industry, research, government and academia to join NIC on sabbatical.It has also recommended "5% of annual budget for capacity building and training".The Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY) has slowly been working to improve the internal efficiency and organisational structure of the NIC in the past two years.Lack of up to date technical expertise and an intricate internal structure have long plagued NIC, according to several people ET has spoken to in the past. Till recently, it did not even have a permanent appointee heading it.NIC 2.0 will continue to play an important role in e-governance plans for Digital India, said the HLC presentation.The committee has also said that NIC will now focus "to identify, establish and maintain the core data assets for government agencies...( and) keep abreast with cutting edge technologies".
