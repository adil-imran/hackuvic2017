Trump Surge Continues As Latest LA Times Poll Reveals Millennials Aren't Hillary's Only Problem

ZeroHedge ^ | September 18, 2016

Posted on by Zakeet

Yesterday, we highlighted Hillary's growing "Millennial Problem" pointing out that her support among young voters seemingly collapsed at the same time she took her 9/11 "stumble" off the sidewalk (see: "Hillary's Growing "Millennial Problem" Forces A Reset"). In fact, the collapse is reflected in the Real Clear Politics average of national polls, which shows Clinton's lead has now been reduced to the smallest margin since the DNC.

But, according to the latest polling data from the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times daily tracking poll, Millennial voters aren't the only demographic hurting Clinton. First, the overall daily poll, which tracks 3,000 U.S. citizens from around the country, shows Trump opening up a massive 7-point national lead, his largest since the DNC.

And, as we mentioned yesterday, the LA Times poll confirms a Trump surge with Millennial voters.

But perhaps evening more shocking is the Trump surge among black voters. After polling at basically 0% for the past several months, the latest data suggests that Trump has surged to over 20% as Hillary has tanked.

Meanwhile, Trump has also surged with people having a high school education or less...

And male voters, in general...

While his support from female voters has improved marginally as well.

Granny Pickles' support is dropping almost as fast as she is!

Clinton’s problem is that there just isn’t any enthusiasm for her. Yesterday, Sanders held a rally in Akron OH to support Clinton that attracted 150 at most (looked more like 50 from the pictures). Meanwhile, thousands turned out for a Trump rally in Colorado, and the video of that rally has already had over 100,000 views on youtube. Every Trump rally is the same high energy, enthusiastic sort, while ever Clinton rally is small and low energy.

Get ready for the Free college tuition speech and paying African Americans to go to college. Hillary will be getting desperate. I love if alot of states are in play. No way Hillary can keep up with Donald’s pace visiting all the states.



To: Zakeet

They’re just not that into you, Hillary.



To: euram

Plus nobody told me college grads aren’t supposed to like trump. Guess I got that diploma by accident. I’m feeling very confident. Now if obummer can avoid WWWIII and declare himself king, we are in good shape.

November 9-10-11 or so will be uproariousy funny. The networks will barely be able to hide their wailing and gnashing of teeth at President-elect Trump. Her defenders will instantly write the eulogy for the republic. The congressional black caucus will have a full scale wailin’ and pew jumpin’ free for all calling the new president everything but white. Hollywood will implode with cries of the end. The only thing that wont happen is them all getting on the airplane for whatever country. Samantha Bee will jump into a vat of boiling oil. Oh how I can’[t WAIT for November 9th!



To: Zakeet

DNC suicide watch?



To: Zakeet

The massive jump in AA support is eye popping. To me, it all came down to Trump simply asking them “what do you have to lose” voting for him. Continue to let blacks and millenials know their vote is wanted and they will respond.



To: Zakeet

One of Hillary’s big problem with Millennials is that they are now beginning to realize what people over 50 have known about her and her crooked husband all along. They were taught in public schools that it was only lying about sex. Now they are beginning to discover the real truth.

Neither was Bill in the last 20 years or so.

You folks have to also realize that the majority of pollsters are using poll models developed from the 2008 & 2012 POTUS elections. These models have no validity, merit and are nowhere near the model and demographics of 2016. America has never seen an election like this. IMHO....I see nothing but a landslide victory by Donald J. Trump!!! IMHO....at this moment Trump will win Texas, Florida, Ohio. Pennsylvania & North Carolina with ease!!! Down the road, four or five weeks out, Trump will lead in many “Blue” states, no one ever believed he could be competitive in!!! I would lay my model out for you...but...I would instantly be considered insane. Here is my short input....Trump wins New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Virginia, Maine, Vermont & New Hampshire...he wins Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona & New Mexico. Both the Senate & the House stay firmly in control by the Republicans. Trump not only slaughters Clinton, politically ...he destroys a good portion of the enitre Dempcrat Party. The Democrat Party Establishment leadership have made exactly the same mistakes that the Republican Party Establishment and the Clinton/Obama biased media made in the GOP primiaries....they badly under estimated Trump & company!!! End of story!!!

Wanna bet? We lost in 2012 due to rampant fraud. This time it will be unprecedented.

Samantha Bee will jump into a vat of boiling oil. No, she'll just find a streetcorner and be more honest about how she makes a living.

New York and New Jersey? If you are right on those it will be a landslide of historic proportions.



To: Talisker

Clinton problem is it is her



To: dp0622

I did not get that memo either.



To: Zakeet

Disgusting to see the majority of women polled support The Bitch - obviously, because she’s a woman and that’s ALL they care about and as far as their teeny little brains can go.

All good trends. Ignore all media Get Out The Vote

Fraud was a good part of it, but we lost because Myth Romney was just a cold puddle of puke.

Her biggest problem isn’t millennials. It’s that she’s been stinking up the public stage for what seems like a millenium now.

Myth Romney aka Mittens was the FATHER OF OBAMASCARE.

When the Muzziebrohood world mafia types come calling for their money back it should be fun to watch...is there such a mafia? Don’t know, don’t care, but someone will come after them. That should give their NWO a new perspective on globalism...as in, there is no where on the “globe” they can hide.

Heck, I used “what do you have to lose” on a fearful normally Republican friend who’s heard/seen too much that’s been put out by the Ds and media. I’m pretty convinced she still trusts Fox News.



To: VideoPaul

The night of the election will be fun. Watching states fall like flies to Trump, and hearing one of the highly paid newsreaders say on one of the alphabet networks, “I can’t believe this is happening” or something to that effect. I think deep down they know Hillary is done but to hear them express their shock of a Trump victory vocally will be priceless.



To: dp0622

Good tag line!



To: Navin Johnson

Amazing that this phrase will be in the political history books as a turning point in American history.



To: Former Proud Canadian

I am skeptical that Trump will win NY and NJ, but Trump has won the electoral college if those calling the results cannot determine the winner in NY and NJ before the polls close in HI

I’d love to hear the strategery being discussed between Trump and Guiliani on the airplane between rallies. Especially would have loved to have heard them reacting to the press meltdown of this past friday.

Actually, only single women support Hillary. A majority of married women support Trump. Single women pull down the average for everyone.

I remember election night in 1994, when the Republicans swept nearly every race in the nation. The TV talking heads were apoplectic.

Actually it is very simple. Black, Mexican, and white middle class voters do not get government largess. They know they have been getting screwed over for the last eight years. The class benefiting from the government be they black, white, brown etc. will continue to be loyal lemmings to the Demonic-Rat party. If you have a job and are trying to get ahead, Clinton is not your friend. Those at the very top have no allegiance to either party. They will support the party or individual that best serves their corporation, their tax bracket, and others want to be seen as part of the elite’s elite. The last are the most despicable as they have no standards of decency. They are shallow with not one standards of decency unless it infringes on their extravagant cloistered lifestyle. As I said it is really that simple.

Lets just hope that Trump starts daily briefings and news conferences from the Office of the President Elect... :) It's my theory that that is one of the reasons he is such a hurry to get his hotel finished. I think he is going to officially open office there on 11/09/2016

Who is “we”? Romney lost because many of us did not vote for him... and he never connected with real people. Vote fraud happened. But it is not why Romney lost. And Romney is not the “we” of Cruz or Trump supporters.



To: Bubba_Leroy

I remember that too! I was a wavering Democrat at the time, and I still found it amusing.



To: spintreebob

So it appears you did not vote for Romney. Thanks for Obama.
