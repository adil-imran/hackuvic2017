[Australian] Catholic Bishop Calls on Church to Accept Homosexuality

The Australian ^ | 9/7/16 | Greg Brown

Posted on by marshmallow

The bishop of the Catholic diocese of Parramatta has called on the church to accept homosexuality, lamenting that the faith is not a trailblazer against inequality.

Bishop Vincent Long Van Nguyen has gone further than the Pope, who has said God loves and accepts gay people.

Bishop Long said it was not good enough to treat gay people with compassion and then define their lifestyle as intrinsically disordered. The comments, del­ivered in a speech in western Sydney last month, are likely to cause consternation in the church hierarchy, which is against same-sex marriage.

We cannot talk about the ­integrity of creation, the universal and inclusive love of God, while at the same time colluding with the forces of oppression in the ill-treatment of racial minorities, women and homosexual persons, Bishop Long said.

It wont wash with young people, especially when we purport to treat gay people with love and compassion and yet define their sexuality as intrinsically disordered. This is particularly true when the church has not been a shining beacon and a trailblazer in the fight against inequality and ­intolerance.

Bishop Long was appointed by Pope Francis in May to lead one of Australias largest dioceses.

The speech is in direct contrast to the views of his predecessor at the diocese, Anthony Fisher, who is now the most senior Catholic in NSW as Archbishop of Sydney.

good grief people, it’s in the 10 commandments! THALL SHALT NOT COMMIT ADULTERY. Since you can’t enter into holy matrimony with someone of the same sex. Any sexual act you commit with them is by definition adultery! This is Bible 101 people! Don’t like it? TAKE IT UP WITH GOD! Because, I didn’t make the rules, he did.

I seen reports that Trump is behind with the Catholics. It’s starting to make sense.



To: PraiseTheLord

Likely not. He may be one of those, like one Anglican priest I met, who never took anything related to the Old Testament at seminary. I can’t help but think this is one of the reasons that Christianity is being assailed on such a large scale. Such pastors and priest really don’t know anything.



To: expatguy

Wow. Cultural Marxism 101.



To: marktwain

A known heretic appointed Bishop by a heretical Pope. They demons have infested the Church and God will purge them.



To: onedoug

Maybe but the New Testament is pretty specific. That God loves all of his creation is not a green light to do what is “right” in one’s own eyes. “Go and sin no more” comes to mi.nd

It is more than the lifestyle that is intrinsically disordered. It is their psycho-sexual inclinations. But the same can be said for all other inclinations other than monogamous heterosexual permanent inclinations.

We cannot talk about the ­integrity of creation, the universal and inclusive love of God, while at the same time colluding with the forces of oppression in the ill-treatment of racial minorities, women and homosexual persons, Bishop Long said. Spazspeak and heresy! “... colluding with the forces of oppression in the ill-treatment of racial minorities, women and homosexual persons,...  ‘the forces of oppression’? ‘the ill-treatment of racial minorities, women and homosexual persons’? This character impersonating a Bishop should be canned immediately!

Bishop demands 10 commandments taken out of bible. Alienates and hurts murderers, liars, adulterers, sex perverts, and greedy coveters.



To: marshmallow

NEVER!



We need more Bishops with spines who know what the Catholic Church teaches and who will articulate it clearly and forcefully in the face of the depravity referred to as contemporary society.

It all depends on what the meaning of the word “shalt not” is.

Perhaps I’m old fashioned, but I’ve always believed Christians and the church should accept the Bible. If my personal preferences disagree with the Bible’s infallible guidance, I’m wrong. If we disagree, I should to the best of my ability follow the Bible and resist any desires that are not compatible with scripture. But that’s just me. Others seem to think it’s their job to edit the Bible and correct what they see as God’s mistakes.

this is diametrically opposed to the clear Biblical teachings on the subject as such, this Bishop should be held to answer per the Church’s Canon Law, which provides in part for the removal of church officers who (obstinately, meaning after being informed of their error continue to) deny or publicly advocate against church teachings... See Canon Law Sect. 194 his archbishop needs to give him a ring ASAP...

“It wont wash with young people...” Well OK then, now it makes sense. The young people have weighed in. Freegards



To: Pollster1

Bullshit from this Bishop buffoon; a fellow traveler of the schmucks who chose Pope Frankie. Yet the implications of his moral sedition is beyond this horses ass

The 4th, of the Ten Commandments, is a bedrock defining the Moral Order for Man; ordering us to honor the Father and Mother; thereby recognizing the criticality and vitality of the Family Unit as the foundation for the social order of culture and society.

As such, any attitude or behavior which harms the Family, such as abortion, homosexuality, transgenderism; among other psychoses, is anathema and haraam.

Catechism of the Catholic Church 2357 Homosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the same sex. It has taken a great variety of forms through the centuries and in different cultures. Its psychological genesis remains largely unexplained. Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity, tradition has always declared that "homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered." They are contrary to the natural law. They close the sexual act to the gift of life. They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved.

Its time that we address this bigoted, judgmental issue of sin. Satan will never let up on any of us. That is the message for ALL time, not just this year, this decade or this century. The "bigoted, judgmental issue of sin" has been with humanity since Adam and Eve. It won't go away after the election either...whoever wins.



To: TexasFreeper2009

It’s my belief that some people think of the 10 commandments as the “10 suggestions.” They will meet their Makers someday, who will straighten them out...for eternity.

And yet stubborn "conservative Catholics" will continue to insist that accepting Darwinism and higher criticism had absolutely nothing to do with this!
