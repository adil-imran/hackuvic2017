BOOM! Richard Grenell shreds Brian Fallons Hillaryous media guidance about WikiLeaks

Posted on by TigerClaws

It looks like Hillary Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon has had about enough of the trickle of WikiLeaks hacked emails being released without the media accompanying them with the Team Hillary spin:

If you are going to write about materials issued by @wikileaks, you should at least state they are product of illegal hack by a foreign govt

Brian Fallon ‏@brianefallon 10h10 hours ago

Media needs to stop treating Wikileaks like it is same as FOIA. Assange is colluding with Russian government to help Trump.



TOPICS:

Crime/Corruption

Government

News/Current Events

Politics/Elections

KEYWORDS:

Hillary's spokesman having a complete Twitter meltdown over the leads. Latest batch showed coordination on the Uranium One deal between the foundation and SoS office. It also showed Hillary knew the Saudis and Qatar were funding ISIS. Hillary was taking money from both for the foundation and Obama was funneling money to both countries. The people who helped create ISIS funded Hillary as well. MSM though it talking about sex talk from 12 years ago...

But leaking Donald Trump’s tax return was perfectly legal.



To: TigerClaws

The MSN won't ask Hillary about the Wikileaks since they are invested in her and the Progressive Cause. Can you imagine what it would to to ask Hillary "Wileaked emails say you funneled money to ISIS, what do you say about that?"



To: TigerClaws

I saw a Facebook posting going around today from Democrats that the Wikileaks emails are fabricated. That is the next argument.

The media is the enemy. We need to focus on destroying the media.

The Media is colluding with Brain Fallon and Hillary Clinton to beat up their enemies in public, like the Brown Shirts did to the Jews, all those years ago.

So he is apparently far more concerned and upset about how the emails were obtained than the crimes and shady dealings revealed in the emails. Hard to generate much sympathy for a criminal that is herself the victim of a crime, especially when the crime she is a victim of is merely to keep her from getting away with her crimes.

I saw a Facebook posting going around today from Democrats that the Wikileaks emails are fabricated. That is the next argument. How odd - when Hillary distinctly and minutely recalled why she referred to Abraham Lincoln in one of the Podesta emails... :)

It's okay for a Bush Dynasty family member and operative to illegally tape a conversation (which he egged on) and release it to initiate a coup attempt, but not okay that there's a global effort to expose hillary for what she is? I'd love to see a chain of possession of that illegal tape. Another issue is NBC involvement in helping the Bush Dynasty. Why the heck was this third-rate Bushie working such a high-profile job for NBC? Was there no one more qualified?

To: Heartland Mom

Part of the reason that government communications (i.e. email) is supposed to be properly archived is that this then allows the government to certify — “this is real” and “this is fake”. But Hillary blew that up. She had a private server, she deleted the emails, and she wiped it with a cloth. Now stuff comes out and makes her look bad. Her defense? “That’s not a real email”. Yeah?? Prove it. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

“If you are going to write about materials issued by @wikileaks, you should at least state they are product of illegal hack by a foreign govt” Well, Grenell...only when you admit you and your MSM ilk are nothing more than traitorous propaganda agents of your corrupted government hacks.



To: kiryandil

“How odd - when Hillary distinctly and minutely recalled why she referred to Abraham Lincoln in one of the Podesta emails... :)” This was one of the most important moments in that debate, and one which no one seems to have noticed. Hillary confirmed that the Wikileaks emails (at least some of them) were genuine. One of the challenges of being a dishonest person is that it’s difficult to keep track of all the supporting lies.

They did the ‘fabricated’ argument with the DNC emails — then fired everyone involved. Hillary has already verified the emails as being real in her own statements.



To: Heartland Mom

I saw a Hillary spokesperson saying that yesterday a out the leaked speeches to big banks. But the interviewer asked why Hillary doesn’t just release the transcripts and clear it all up,...back to the Russians!

At the debate, Hillary didn’t deny what she said at the Brazilian bank, she just blamed it in Abraham Lincoln.



To: TigerClaws

Do you have any links on those findings? Thanks!



To: TigerClaws; All

Wiki struck back! https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/785695665531662336 As for specific findings, bing/google etc search as there are news stories out already on the Uranium One and Saudi/ISIS connections.



To: TigerClaws

How about the unauthorized ‘hot mic’ recording of Trump when he was not in front of a camera?

They have already acknowledged them....but my what a massive impressive hoax if anyone could have pulled that off. They are only trying to keep the base in line and they know how easily led their base is.



To: angcat

Wow, keep doing exactly what you’re doing! (Except maybe format it a little for my old eyes.) You are providing a valuable service to FReepers who would not normally see those emails.

Media needs to stop treating Wikileaks like it is same as FOIA. You got an awful lot of flak over your clandestine server. Obviously, the Obama Administration as a whole is rife with such, it isnt just you. But you have some nerve to say anything about FOIA, when your clandestine server had no other purpose but to evade that law. As far as Wikileaks revealing anything embarrassing about your dealings, well - if you have defrauded the people of their right to know what you and your Foundation have been up to, dont be surprised if people believe Wikileaks. Its the same principle that is applicable to the question of who put Craig Livingstone up to the depredations against former White House staffers privacy. You were in the White House, and you were too important to be thrown under the bus. Which is a perfect description of whoever actually was responsible for that abuse. It is a moral certainty that you know who hired Livingstone, and only very slightly less certain that you did it yourself. Either way, you are stained by that abuse of power, and by your acquiescence in it by not naming the perp.
