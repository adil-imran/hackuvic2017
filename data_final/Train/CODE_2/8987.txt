CNN Instant Poll Hands Debate Victory to Mike Pence Over Tim Kaine

The Wrap ^ | October 4, 2016 | Scott Collins

Posted on by 2ndDivisionVet

It may have been close, but a CNN instant poll handed the debate victory to Mike Pence.

The GOP vice presidential candidate met his Democratic challenger Tim Kaine in their only debate Tuesday, which aired live on multiple networks. The pair hammered at each other for 90 minutes on a wide range of subjects, including Russian leader Vladimir Putin, the abortion debate, the Syrian civil war and the business record of GOP nominee and Pences running mate, Donald Trump.

According to CNN, 48 percent of viewers surveyed thought Pence won the debate, compared to 42 percent for Kaine.

That put the w in the Trump camp tonight, a CNN political commentator said on-air, giving the win to the Republican side.

Meanwhile, Trump surrogates seemed eager to exploit Kaines frequent interruptions during the debate, turning the tables on critics who had faulted Trump for similar behavior during the first debate with Hillary Clinton last month.

Sen. Kaine could not stop interrupting Gov. Pence, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway complained to CBS News after the debate had ended. It was really unhinged and unfortunate.

However, there is not much evidence that vice presidential debates matter much when it comes to elections. Americans tend to focus on the presidential candidates rather than their running mates.

Also, this debate seemed to lack the one indelible line no American could forget, such as when Lloyd Bentsen dressed down Dan Quayle in 1988 with: Youre no Jack Kennedy.

There are at least two that swing the other way. CNN's focus group was about 15-5 in favor of Kaine, and PolitOpinion strongly favors Kaine.

I read that the sample was D+15 lol.

CNN heavily polled Democrats - through their own admission. Their chyron currently has CNN/ORC INSTANT POL: PENCE NARROWLY WINS DEBATE...

It might not have changed any minds (but I bet it did some). Regardless Pence sure didn’t lose any votes for Trump tonight. He did his boss well!

Kaine’s debut on the national stage was a epic disaster. “He” is an incredibly unlikeable person.

“at least two that swing the other way” has specific meaning for Kaine.

To: Reno89519

That’s the biggest take-away for nearly everyone, Kaine was extremely annoying and is just not a very likable person. Pence was strong, solid, competent, and trustworthy.

Kaine is f’n Shitlerey’s eunuch ... No man card nor gravitas aka faggot ...



To: 2ndDivisionVet

Bwahahaha! I just have to say this because it made me laugh. I went to headlineoftheday.com to vote in their poll and they have two large, close-up pictures of the vp candidates I know for tv candidates may wear a little pancake style make-up but Tim Kaine is most definitely wearing eyeliner and mascara!



To: 2ndDivisionVet

Kaine is no ALgore He's worse



To: Enchante

Kreepy Kaine.

Yeah, and Ohio doesn't count now, either. If Kaine won, the media would be treating it like the second coming.

Funny how the media only talks about what little impact debates have on elections after their guy gets trounced.



To: 2ndDivisionVet

48 to 42???.

Now we know how biased this poll is. Trump won first debate!

A disastrous debate for Kaine.



To: 2ndDivisionVet

When the media constantly says “Vice presidential debates don’t really matter” it means they know the democrat lost.

Kaines debut on the national stage was a epic disaster. Yes it was. Creepy Uncle Joe could get away with boorish behavior because he was a known quantity. Not so with Kreepy Kaine.



To: Ken H

Uncle Joe’s a nice guy. Could easily see having a beer with him, sharing a ride on Amtrak, etc. But Kaine? I’d be looking to call the police. He is beyond creepy.

If Hillary were elected then fell over and went bye bye we’d have daily clown sittings in the whitehouse.



To: 2ndDivisionVet

Drudge poll had it a smothering 95.18% Pence, 4.82% Kaine.

THAT WEIRD MAN could be President. I guess Hillary really is mentally impaired.

The only reason Kaine is in the race is because he traded Hillary his post at the DNC for the VP slot so Debbie Washerherhairinshitz could get inside the DNC to fix the ‘16 primary for Hillary.

Bad judgement. Another disastrous decision by her.



To: 2ndDivisionVet

Yep - even this morning I’ve seen a few with over 70% for Pence. They are still trying to pretend and it’s getting harder for them because they have to get even loonier to do so.

Wish I could have seen the CNN reporter’s face when they choked out the words that Pence was the poll winner.

I think Kaine channels this comedian.

Huckabee compares Kaine’s debate performance to a ‘yappy Chihuahua’ By POLITICO Staff 10/05/16 07:29 AM EDT Former Arkansas governor and Donald Trump supporter Mike Huckabee weighed in on Tuesdays vice presidential debate, hitting both Tim Kaines overeager performance and Hillary Clintons wealth. Tim Kaine seems to think a VP serves the same function for a President as a yappy Chihuahua does for a socialites purse, Huckabee tweeted early Wednesday morning. His tweet followed several from the previous night, when he complained that the vice presidential debate moderator, Elaine Quijano, aided the Clinton campaign by also debating Indiana Governor and GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence. He also slammed Kaine for being panned and canned.



To: Cboldt

Not anymore! lol Tim Kaine

49.5%, 135232 votes

Mike Pence

50.5%, 137942 votes

Heheh - I checked it this morning too, to see if the early 40,000 vote preference for Kaine was holding up. CNN is probably still touting Kaine as the long term winner though. I see the WaPo "fact checker" piece supports the usual lies about Trump, the half dozen items that Kaine mentioned and Pence did not defend Trump.



To: Reno89519

Kaines debut on the national stage was a epic disaster. He is an incredibly unlikeable person. Kain has about as much class as my pet pig Elmer!

Dick Cheney very much impressed me in 1999 from before I was a rock-ribbed conservative. I definitely thought at the time that he added a great deal to the ticket.
