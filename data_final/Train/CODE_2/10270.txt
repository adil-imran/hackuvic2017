PAKISTAN’S Supreme Court has dismissed the execution appeal of a mentally ill man, claiming that a large proportion of Pakistani prisoners suffer from mental illness and they “cannot let everyone go.”

Last week, the execution of Imdad Ali, who has been declared insane by government doctors, was halted amid an intense legal battle to save him from hanging.

Mr Ali had been scheduled to die at 5.30am on Tuesday last week in a prison in the city of Vehari, in Pakistan, despite having been diagnosed with schizophrenia.

In a last-minute bid, the 50-year-old was given last-minute relief when the Supreme Court of Pakistan (SCP) gave a seven-day stay order on the petition file by the Justice Project Pakistan (JPP).

Mr Ali came within hours of execution, despite prison doctors having assessed him as being “insane”, including the night before his supposed death.

Overnight, judges conceded that Mr Ali was mentally ill but concluded that they would dismiss the appeal because the case had already been considered by the Court and — in their view — nothing had changed.

He could be executed with the week.

Mr Ali, 50, was sentenced to death for the murder of a religious scholar in 2002 under section 302 Pakistan Penal Code. He has served 16 years in prison on death row.

Pakistan reinstated the death penalty following a massacre at an Army Public School in Peshawar by the Taliban, in which more than 100 students were killed.

Mr Ali’s wife, Safina Bano, was disappointed by the the Supreme Court ruling and begged the mercy from the President of Pakistan.

“Now my last hope is that the President of Pakistan take mercy on the mentally ill and save him from the gallows,” she told news.com.au.

“If you send the mentally ill to the gallows it will not be the rule of the law, but a big un- justice”, she said as long tears streamed down her face.

Tariq Ramadan Professor of Contemporary Islamic Studies at Oxford University said in his written article that “the Islamic legal tradition is clear: only those who are aware of their actions can be judged and considered responsible for their actions”.

He wrote that: “If Imdad Ali’s execution is prevented and his death sentence commuted, it will be a first step towards ensuring that others suffering from mental illness are treated with the justice and the compassion our religion teaches and encourages.”

Lawyers for Mr Ali argued that he should not be executed as to do so would violate both Pakistani and international law.

Commenting, Harriet McCulloch, Deputy Director of the death penalty team at international human rights charity Reprieve said: “It is indisputable that Imdad suffers from serious mental illness.

“There is therefore no doubt that, should Pakistan execute him, it will be committing a grave violation of both Pakistani and international law. It is shocking that the system has failed Imdad at every turn — right the way up to the Supreme Court.

“The Pakistan Government must immediately halt Imdad’s execution, and undertake a comprehensive review into how someone who is clearly mentally unfit to be executed has been allowed to come so near to the noose.”

According to the JPP, a record number of 419 people have been hanged since 2014 while more than 8000 are on death row. Though only a tiny fraction have been for terror charges.

Ali comes from a poor family with a history of schizophrenia. During his detention, his mental illness has worsened.

He spent the past three years in solitary confinement after fellow inmates complained of his manic episodes in which he would speak loudly and uncontrollably.

Ali’s illness was first noticed by his family after his return from Saudi Arabia in 1998 where he had lived as a teenager to work as an electrician.

According to his elder brother, Altaf Ali, 57, after his return from Saudi Arabia he could be found talking to himself or to objects.

The act of murder, they believe, is the result of Ali’s severe case of schizophrenia.

Ali’s sister, Amna Begum, 60, told news.com.au their father, Muhammad Ismail, also suffered from the same illness. The same sense of invincibility convinced him to jump in front of a moving train one night. He left behind a widow and six children.

A medical report seen by AFP said Ali’s speech was incoherent, he frequently spoke and laughed to himself, and he suffered from paranoia and delusions of grandeur.

“There was history of self-talk, gesturing, posturing, odd ideas and beliefs, bizarre ideations and lack of concern for his death sentence,” a 2012 medical report revealed.

Ali is not the only mentally or physically unfit prisoner sitting in Pakistan’s death row.

Abdul Basit, who is paralysed from the waist down, had his execution suspended in 2015. Another, Khizar Hayat, a diagnosed schizophrenic, had his execution halted last year.

Despite being officially diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, the Lahore High Court last month rejected arguments that Ali should not be executed because of his illness.

Barrister Sarah Belal, executive director of Justice Project Pakistan, said, “We are extremely relieved to hear that the Supreme Court has stayed Imdad’s execution until next week.

“The Honourable Court will finally be presented the overwhelming fact of his mental illness, one that has been repeatedly confirmed by the medical community, his family and even the jail authorities. Imdad’s life hangs in the balance until they do.”

It took 14 renowned physicians to write a letter and express their concern over the execution of the mentally ill to add to the case to keep Ali alive.

Tahir Feroze Khan, a consulting psychiatrist at Nishter Hospital, Multan, Pakistan’s fifth most populous city, has evaluated Ali’s mental state in prison for the past five years and demanded pardon for Ali on the humanitarian grounds.

“He is a declared insane person. It is little relief about the temporary relief, but this is not a solution for Mr Ali,” Dr Khan told news.com.au.

“He must be pardoned on the basis of his illness. To hear about his death warrant was shocking news for me.

“By all means, Imdad Ali is unfit to stand trial. His capital punishment needs immediate review.”

Ali’s wife Safina Bano expressed her happiness on the temporary stay order of her husband’s execution but urged the President of Pakistan to pardon her husband in the name of humanity.

During a talk with the news.com.au, Mrs Bano’s eyes were full of tears of joy, but expressed concern over the upcoming decision over her husband’s life.

“My husband doesn’t know what going to happen to him, he has no sense of where he is living and what he is doing, but he is precious for me,” she said.

“I know this is temporary relief for us, what’s happening in the coming days I don’t know, but I beg the life of the my mentally ill husband from the President of Pakistan in the name of the humanity.”

Lahore’s University of Health Sciences Professor Emeritus Malik Hussain Mubbasshar said: “The law does not allow such execution of prisoners suffering from this nature of mental disorder in which the prisoner is having a psychotic illness and is unable to know why is he being executed and what will be the consequence of this punishment.”

Human Rights Watch and the Asian Human Rights Commission have both expressed concerns about Mr Imdad’s upcoming execution, while this weekend some 9000 people signed an online petition calling for him to be saved.

A Mercy petition on Ali’s behalf that had been pending before it was missed by the Pakistan President Mamnoon Hussain last November.

Harriet McCulloch, deputy director of Reprieve’s death penalty team said, “while it’s a huge relief to Imdad’s family that he has been given a stay of execution, there is still a very real risk that he could be executed as early as next week.

“Imdad is seriously mentally ill — the government’s own doctors have described him as insane. International law is clear that the hanging of a mentally ill person would constitute cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, not to mention an arbitrary application of the law in violation of accepted human rights standards.

“If Imdad’s execution were to proceed it would mean a serious violation of Pakistan’s international obligations, and an irreversible miscarriage of justice.

“This execution must be halted all costs.”
