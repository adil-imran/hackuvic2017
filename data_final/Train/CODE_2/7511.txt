NEW DELHI (Sputnik) ‚Äî On its 70th Independence Day, India has taken a huge diplomatic upturn by expressing support to the ongoing freedom movement by the people of the Gilgit and Balochistan areas controlled by Pakistan. In his Independence Day speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned Pakistan against continued atrocities on the people in these areas and called for an end to the glorification of terrorism.

‚ÄãIn his speech of more than one-and-a-half hours from the ramparts of Red Fort, Gilgit and Balochistan received special attention in Modi's speech.

"The world is watching. In the last few days the way the people of Balochistan, Gilgit, from Pak occupied Kashmir have thanked me, it is the honor of 1.25 billion people of India. I thank those people from Balochistan, Gilgit and Pak occupied Kashmir," said Modi in his speech.

Last week, Modi demanded an explanation from the Pakistan government asking "why has Pakistan been committing atrocities on people in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Balochistan".

Modi slammed Pakistan for its sympathizing with terrorists. "There are some who celebrate killing of innocents by terrorists and glorify them. What sort of terror-inspired government is that, the whole world knows about it."
