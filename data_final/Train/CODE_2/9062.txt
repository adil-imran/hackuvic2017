Someone who could not guard a few classified emails does not seem a likely choice to be the guardian of Americas women and children

On October 9, 2016 Donald Trump squared off with Hillary Clinton in what can only be described as a rout. Trump made a spectacular comeback in every area of the debate starting off with a very genuine apology for what he called, locker room talk about women.

Because Trump dealt head on with the issue of his former conversation with Howard Stern, Hillary was cautious not to make herself look like the only person in the room willing to pick up the first stone with which to pummel Mr. Trump.

The media is 11 year old narcissistic troll central. Trump was trying to refocus the debate on America in the beginning but he kept getting trolled in personal attacks by the first staged question that she obviously was ready for.

There was no “comeback.” In the first encounter Trump was scoping out the battlefield and sent out some skirmishers, nothing more.

There was no comeback. In the first encounter Trump was scoping out the battlefield and sent out some skirmishers, nothing more. And a lot of his advisers were telling him to reel it in - how many here were oh-so-worried he would go on the attack and sink himself? Turns out that the only way to fight some diseases is with fire throwers....
