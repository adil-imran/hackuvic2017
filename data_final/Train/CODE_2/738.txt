Instead of "man and wife" use spouses or partners. Switch out "man made" with artificial, handmade or manufactured.

The memo goes on to list a variety of occupations that typically include the word "man" in them and offers replacements: business person instead of businessman, firefighter instead of fireman, ancestors instead of forefathers, and so on."Consistent with style guidelines issued by Princeton's Office of Human Resources and Office of Communications, and as endorsed by the Institutional Equity Planning Group as a preferred University practice, HR has developed these gender inclusive style guidelines,the memo states.

We do strive to be a diverse and inclusive campus and to ensure that everyone feels welcome, accepted, and respected."Cramer clarified Princeton's policy in a similar way, saying "these are guidelines issued by HR, developed in cooperation with Institutional Equity Planning Group for communication and job postings. Students are not mandated to follow this policy."
