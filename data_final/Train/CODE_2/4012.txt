Last week, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), Australia's version of the FDA, announced formal plans to legalize medical marijuana throughout the country this November.The TGA has recognized the medicinal use of some cannabinoids since 1984, yet Australia's National Drugs and Poisons Scheduling Committee (NDPSC) has kept cannabis a Schedule 9 controlled substance."The scheduling of cannabis and its extracts has been considered by the National Drugs and Poisons Scheduling Committee (NDPSC) on a number of occasions," the TGA states in a description of the scheduling history. "Currently, cannabis is a Schedule 9 substance, i.e., a prohibited substance which may be abused or misused and the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which is prohibited by law."Australia has gone through a similar heart-wrenching legalization process as many other nations, driven by parents illegally treating their epileptic children with cannabis while citizens also openly participate in mass civil disobedience of recreational smoking events as depicted in the video report below.In January of this year, the TGA launched a public proposal to re-schedule cannabis to allow medical use. The response was overwhelmingly in favor of rescheduling.Internet searches for " how to grow weed " surged in Australia.This week, the TGA delegates decided to down-schedule cannabis and tetrahydrocannabinols (plant, its seeds, its extracts and derivatives of the extracts) from Schedule 9 to Schedule 8 for human therapeutic use.Advocates are celebrating the decision as another step in the right direction, but they warn that regulations could take some time to set up.The TGA says more studies are needed about cannabis and lists some of the regulatory concerns as follows:With this decision, Australia joins a wave of marijuana legalization across the globe.Medical cannabis use is already decriminalized in many countries, including more than half of the United States Countries like Uruguay and Canada , and four US states - Colorado, Washington, Oregon, and Alaska - are leading the charge for legal recreational use.Perhaps one of the biggest reasons that marijuana legalization now seems inevitable is that social conservatives are beginning to change their minds. In July, a majority of US Republicans polled supported the legalization of recreation cannabis The DEA is on the wrong side of history, much like alcohol prohibition was. Before you know it, cannabis strains will be treated like the fine wines of the Australian hills.
