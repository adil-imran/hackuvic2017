Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray today poked fun at the meeting called by Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadanavis to resolve the imbroglio over the release of Karan Johar's "Ae Dil Hai Mushkil", which was facing threat by Maharashtra Navnirman Sena over the casting of Pakistani actor Fawad Khan."I have not got details about the meeting. But I have news that all three (Devendra Fadnavis, Karan Johar and Raj Thackeray) have decided to produce a movie. The name has also been finalised. It is titled 'Yeh to Hona hi Tha'," Mr Thackeray said.Yesterday, Mr Fadanavis mediated a meeting between Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackarey and the makers of the film, at his residence 'Varsha' in Mumbai to cool tempers and facilitate the smooth release of the movie after Maharashtra Navnirman Sena called off its agitation.Maharashtra Navnirman Sena had been vehemently protesting against the screening of movies featuring Pakistani actors and artists post the Uri terror attacks, which claimed the lives of 19 soldiers.Responding to a question, Mr Thackeray said Shiv Sena did not participate in the protests alongside Maharashtra Navnirman Sena as they (Shiv Sena) were gauging the situation."We decided to keep aloof and see who takes what stand on this issue," Mr Thackeray said refusing to answer any further question on the controversy."Sometimes it is better not to answer a few questions," he said, adding "people are wise enough to judge the situation."Mr Johar's "Ae Dil Hai Mushkil" had been embroiled in a controversy over the past few weeks after the MNS raised a flag against it, thus putting a question mark on the fate of the movie, slated for a Diwali release on October 28. The film starring Ranbir Kapoor, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Anushka Sharma in lead roles will, however, release as per schedule after a truce was clinched. The producers gave some assurances such as that they would not work with Pakistani artists and technicians in their future projects, given the people's sentiments in the wake of the Pathankot and Uri terror strikes.
