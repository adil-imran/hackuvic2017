NCRI  Irans fundamentalist regime arrested a group of practicing Iranian Christians last week at an in-house church in the city of Isfahan, central Iran.

In total 11 Christians were arrested during the raid on their congregation last Friday, August 12. The raid was carried out by armed plain clothes intelligence agents, according to eye-witnesses.

Ten of those arrested have been identified as Amin Ahanin, Mohammad Alyasi, Fatemeh Amini, Edmund Khachaturian, Mohammad Malek Khatai, Mohsen Khoobyari, Arash Qodsi, Hamed Sepidkar, Samaneh Shahbazi-Far and Maryam Zonubi. An eleventh person arrested at the mass has not yet been identified.

They were taken away in vans by security agents armed with pistols and carrying walkie-talkies.

Books and other Christian literature were confiscated from the in-house church.

There is no information about the current status of the detainees.

What the HELL is wrong with us!! We are sitting there and letting the flaws in humanity succeed! We will pay big time...eventually. In the mean time we seem content to witness human sacrifices to allah. And if Hill gets elected, we will be on the human sacrifice volunteer list whether we like or not!! Celebrate diversity!(and kiss your love one good bye!)
