LONDON â€” Notwithstanding that many (on both sides) feel its result could threaten existence as we know it, the U.S. presidential election has also provided an endless source of inspiration for comedians and internet trolls alike.

And the butt of several politically charged jokes has inevitably been Nickelback â€” the band everyone loves to hate.

No more.

While many may scoff at Nickelback, it seems the Canadian rockers have had enough, or at the very least, they're not taking shade from arguably their counterpart in the UK: British rock duo Royal Blood.

Over the weekend, Royal Blood tweeted this:

@realDonaldTrump + @HillaryClinton = @Nickelback ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ â€” Royal Blood (@royalblooduk) October 7, 2016

And in response, Nickelback had a pretty smooth comeback:

NIckelback jokes are like @royalblooduk, they were a lot cooler a couple years ago. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Don't drink and tweet fellas. Stay safe. XO https://t.co/Gb1IizED4c â€” Nickelback (@Nickelback) October 8, 2016

Fans chastised Royal Blood for the attack, too. #WhentheTrollsGetTrolled:

@royalblooduk @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton @Nickelback your music is almost exactly as embarrassing â€” DUFF (@D_Duberstein) October 9, 2016

@Nickelback Royal who? â€” The Dark Magician (@mauricemorfaw) October 8, 2016

@royalblooduk @Nickelback Not the best way to try & encourage a WorldWide band to bring you on as an opening act to get your career going! â€” JediJohnny (@JediJohnny) October 10, 2016

@royalblooduk If you two twonks created innovative music then you could talk. Instead you sound like you're bitter @Nickelback outsell you. â€” Larry Ash (@LarryFlippinAsh) October 10, 2016

@royalblooduk @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton @Nickelback you lads got fucked by nickelback. Maybe try working on that second album? â€” Keego (@nkeegan) October 9, 2016

Sorry fellas, looks like you just got owned... by Nickelback...

Don't worry though, you're not the first. Whatever you think of the rock group's musical abilities, they've got mad Twitter skillz. Check out some of their finer shutdowns below:
