Events in Sackville, New Brunswick to commemorate wildlife protection and connecting with nature

SACKVILLE, NB, Sept. 15, 2016 /CNW/ - Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) hosted events in Sackville, New Brunswick to celebrate the Migratory Birds Convention Centennial. This international agreement has led to the protection of migrating birds for their nutritional, social, cultural, ecological and economic values. This day was also part of Canadian Heritage's Canada 150 countdown; marking 109 days until 2017 when Canada celebrates its 150th anniversary of Confederation.

In the spring of 2016, ECCC and the Mount Allison Department of Fine Arts launched an art challenge open to students to create innovative artwork that expresses an appreciation for migratory birds. The 16 original pieces were unveiled yesterday; ranging from paintings to delicate glasswork.

Another community event was held yesterday, Painting for the Birds, hosted by a local artist. The event encouraged novice painters to express their appreciation for nature and the iconic status birds have in the community. A Twitter Q&A session will also be hosted today to give Canadians access to some of our leading migratory bird biologists, answering questions about the importance of these species to Canada, their migration routes and local stopovers.

Quotes

"For a century, the Migratory Birds Convention has led to critical international cooperation to protect important wildlife across North America. These diverse species are part of our heritage and play an integral role in maintaining Canada's environmental sustainability. We will continue to work together to protect migratory birds and prevent threats to their survival, including climate change."

– Catherine McKenna, Minister of Environment and Climate Change

"Birds are eye-catching parts of any landscape; drawing our attention, our ears and our hearts. They are also important icons in society used to represent nature—featured on money, stamps and in music and visual arts. This vital cultural connection is protected under the Migratory Birds Convention."

– Garry Donaldson, Biologist, Environment and Climate Change Canada's Canadian Wildlife Service

"Working alongside the team with ECCC was an amazing opportunity. Students were asked to research and design an art piece based on migratory birds, this kind of interdisciplinary project is almost never available to students—we are very fortunate."

– Sara Camus, Fine Arts student, Mount Allison University

Quick facts



This year marks the centennial of the Convention between Canada and the United States for the protection of migratory birds that migrate across international borders. This agreement has led to a century of collaboration between the two countries protecting and managing migratory bird populations and their habitats.

Sackville is a small town with a big connection to migratory birds. It is surrounded by the Tantramar Marshes, a tidal saltmarsh that serves as an important stopover for migrating birds. Their downtown has benches with duck-neck armrests, mallard-shaped lights during the holiday season and many bird-inspired street names and restaurants.
