BJP unnecessarily exaggerating Rahul Gandhi's nap in Parliament: NCP Updated: Jul 21, 2016 13:54 IST

New Delhi, July 21( ANI ): The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) today criticized the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for politicising Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi's nap in Parliament and said that the latter should be given a benefit of doubt as at times several leaders close their eyes trying to digest some serious dialogue.

"It is alright if he was resting for five minutes, he opened his eyes immediately. His ears were open and maybe he was trying to digest some serious dialects that were happening in the house," said NCP leader

"The BJP is successful in asking people to project Rahul continuously for some time, as though the proceedings were not importantwas more important," he added.

Theleader further said that such issues should not be exaggerated

"Many members do close their eyes to relax for a while. That shouldn't be made into an issue and that doesn't mean that they are unconcerned about proceedings," he added.

Putting up a strong defence on this matter, the Congress yesterday said Gandhi is very sensitive when it comes to issues concerning Dalits, Adivasis and minorities, adding the rulingat the Centre must not highlight this episode for political gains.

Questioning the mindset of those politicising the matter, Congress leadersaid the opposition has no other work to do at this point of time.

"If I have just kept my eyes closed while I am sitting, then it does not mean that I am sleeping. The people ponder over several things when they keep their eyes closed, but his mind is working and he listens to others," Mistry told ANI

"This all is being done to politicise the matter. I question the mindset of such elements. Rahul ji is a very sensitive person and gives prominence to the issues concerning the Dalits, Adivasis and minorities," he added.
