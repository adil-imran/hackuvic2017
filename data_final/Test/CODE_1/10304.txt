The president of Nigeria is coming under fire for recently stating that the country has “technically won the war” against Islamic Boko Haram terrorists.

According to media reports, Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari made the claim on Christmas Eve that Boko Haram has been defeated. His remark followed statements last summer that Boko Haram would be totally defeated in Nigeria by the end of 2015.

Troy Augustine, regional manager for Africa for the human rights organization International Christian Concern, says the recent comments are very surprising because the militants are still very active with frequent suicide and IED attacks all over the country.

"As what seems like almost a challenge to Buhari's comments, Boko Haram waged both suicide attacks and sort of a more traditional military takeover of [an entire] village, resulting in multiple attacks with a body count of over 100 people after Buhari's comments on Christmas Eve," Augustine explains.

He tells OneNewsNow that Buhari needs to be honest about the threat.

"[His goal should be] to pursue military and political victory in such a way that will actually try to save lives instead of saving face," he says.

Augustine goes on to say that the Nigerian government has done little to address the present ethnic cleansing of Christians across the country's "Middle Belt" region.
