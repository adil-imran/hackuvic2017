Azerbaijan has urged the international organizations to increase the efforts for ensuring the rights of over a million Azerbaijani refugees and IDPs to return to their native lands.

The remark was made by Azerbaijan's Deputy Foreign Minister Khalaf Khalafov during a meeting with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, Azerbaijan’s Foreign Ministry reported on May 5.

The deputy minister noted that the main obstacle to ensuring the human rights in the country in general, is the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict and the occupation of 20 percent of Azerbaijani lands.

Khalafov also briefed the UN high commissioner about the latest escalation of the situation on the line of contact between Azerbaijani and Armenian armies in early April, the intensive shelling of Azerbaijani civilians along the line of contact and the casualties.

Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein praised the current level of Azerbaijan’s cooperation with the UN human rights system, including the OHCHR. The Commissioner said he was concerned about military clashes that took place on the contact line of troops.

The bloody war, which flared up in the late 1980s due to Armenia's territorial claims against its South Caucasus neighbor, left 700,000 civilians from Nagorno-Karabakh and the regions adjoining it, as well as the regions bordering Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, without homes.

They are temporarily settled in more than 1,600 settlements across 62 cities and regions of Azerbaijan.

Moreover, 250,000 Azerbaijanis were expelled from Armenia and became refugees due to Armenia's ethnic cleansing policy after the emergence of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict with Azerbaijan.

More than 400, 000 internally displaced people continue to live in difficult conditions and due to the size and continuation of problem of IDPs in the country; Azerbaijan needs support of international organizations and donors.
