Recently, Azerbaijan and Armenia exchanged fire in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and the situation almost spiraled out of control. According to a RIA Novosti report, the defense ministries of both countries released a statement, accusing the other side of violating the cease-fire agreement.



Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry claimed that intensive shelling was launched from the Armenian side on the night of April 1, while the Azerbaijan Defense Ministry released footage of its military counterattack on an Armenian troops' command post.



The Nagorno-Karabakh dispute has deep-rooted historical reasons. The failure to solve the disputes shows the big divergences between Azerbaijan and Armenia over this issue and major power rivalry is behind the scene.



The Nagorno-Karabakh dispute is a historical issue left behind by the Soviet era. In the Transcaucasian region, the Islamic Azerbaijanis and the Christian Armenians have long been neighbors, and their populations were once mixed. But there was fierce fighting between the two sides in the early 20th century. Today, the Nagorno-Karabakh region covers 4,388 square kilometers, with a population of about 146,600, the majority of whom are Armenian.



In 1921, the region was put under the administration of Armenia, then part of the Soviet Union, by the Soviet-Russian government. In July 1923, the Caucasian Bureau of the Russian Communist Party Central Committee (Kavbiuro) moved the region to the control of Azerbaijan for the reason of the region's economic development and employment.



In the latter half of the 1980s, with the start of public and democratic reforms advocated by Mikhail Gorbachev, ethnic separatism in Transcaucasia spread fast. The Armenians began to demand the territory of the Nagorno-Karabakh area, and ethnic conflicts between the Azerbaijanis and the Armenians became increasingly sharp.



On December 10, 1991, the Nagorno-Karabakh area held a referendum and 99.89 percent voted for full independence from Azerbaijan. (Azerbaijani citizens, a minority in the area, refused to participate in the referendum.)



After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the two countries went to war over the area, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths, and minority populations in both countries were subject to ethnic cleansing. Armenian forces successfully seized and held the disputed territory.



Under the mediation of the Minsk Group, the two sides signed a cease-fire deal on May 5, 1994, but the disputes remain. In recent years, the region has remained fraught with sporadic exchanges of fire between the two.



The huge divergences between Azerbaijan and Armenia are direct causes for the conflict. With the mediation of the international community, the two sides conducted several rounds of bilateral or multilateral talks, but little was achieved. Azerbaijan, whose economic development has far outweighed that of Armenia, was reluctant to accept the fact of losing Nagorno-Karabakh.



On December 19, 2015, Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev and his Armenian counterpart Serzh Sargsyan met in Bern, Switzerland to discuss the decades-old conflict amid waves of clashes. Divergences still existed and neither side would give way on substantive problems.



Azerbaijan insisted on maintaining its territorial integrity and demanded Armenia withdraw its troops first and return the region to Azerbaijan as the precondition for talks about the status of Nagorno-Karabakh.



Armenia, which has actual control of the region, believed the choice of Nagorno-Karabakh people should be respected and has already set up an "independent" government there, recognized only by Armenia.



In 1992, as proposed by Belarus, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (now the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) created the Minsk Group to solve the Nagorno-Karabakh disputes.



The Minsk Group is headed by a co-chairmanship consisting of France, Russia and the US. It also includes Belarus, Germany, Italy, Turkey and the two combatants. The major participants do not want to see conflicts that would affect their own strategic interests.



For Russia, Armenia is not only a member of the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization, but also a member of the Eurasian Economic Union. It plays a significant role for Russia to consolidate and maintain Russia's interests in the Soviet sphere.



But since the Russo-Georgian War in 2008, closer ties with Azerbaijan in energy and security also suit Russia's interests in the Transcaucasian region.



For the US, a bigger mediation role in the Nagorno-Karabakh clash will not only squeeze Russia's wiggle room in Transcaucasia, but also comfort Armenian-American lobbyists in Congress and solidify US-Armenian ties.



All in all, another full-scale war is unlikely in Nagorno-Karabakh, but the conflict will remain a long-term hotspot issue.
