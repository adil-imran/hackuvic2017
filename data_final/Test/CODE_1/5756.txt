Prime Minister Hun Sen declared yesterday that he will not pardon opposition leader Sam Rainsy, who is now named in three defamation cases against senior officials from the ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) – including the prime minister – and is now in self-imposed exile in France.



Speaking at an environmental protection forum at the Peace Palace in Phnom Penh yesterday, Mr. Hun Sen stressed he would not consider or discuss any request from foreign diplomats to pardon Mr. Rainsy, saying that he and his family had suffered enough insults from him already.



“I would like to send a message to all diplomats. Please do not talk with Hun Sen about this issue. A person who was sentenced by the court, that person must be imprisoned,” he said, adding that even if members of the CPP commit crimes – for which he said many are now in prison – they will also not receive pardons.



Acknowledging that it is within his legal powers to help issue pardons, Mr. Hun Sen said that for Mr. Rainsy, he would not.



“For this case, I would not, under any conditions,” he said.



Mr. Rainsy, the leader of the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), has been living outside Cambodia since November when a warrant for his arrest was issued while he was abroad over historic claims of defamation by then Foreign Minister Hor Namhong.



In July, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court convicted Mr. Rainsy of defaming National Assembly President Heng Samrin and ordered him to pay more than $37,000 in compensation after he falsely claimed the government under Mr. Samrin had ordered the death of King Norodom Sihanouk.



Mr. Rainsy was also sued last month by the prime minister over accusations that Mr. Hun Sen was involved in the murder of political analyst Kem Ley.



Mr. Hun Sen said yesterday that he had taken personal attacks on his family by members of the opposition party personally.



“As a former fighter, peace finder and nation unifier, I cannot raise my hand for signing to facilitate anybody’s release [for this],” he said, appearing close to tears.



Addressing the upcoming commune elections next year, Mr. Hun Sen promised to continue touring the country to meet with villagers as well as provincial officials and members of the armed forces to secure votes for the CPP.



“Why do politicians do that? Honestly, they do it for votes. When I went to visit the grassroots some people said that I just did it for votes. Of course I would like to declare that I went to find votes,” he said.



He claimed that his recent tour of the provinces had led to the solving of many disputes, citing the settling of land titles and market stall ownership as examples, and he would next visit Kampong Cham and Tbong Khmum provinces.



He said that after 30 years he was still popular and could confidently resign from his post with the CPP still in power. But he added that the only reason he hadn’t done so already was due to the lack of a suitable successor.



“The problem is who comes after Hun Sen,” he said.



CNRP spokesman Yim Sovann said his party denied any responsibility over personal attacks on the prime minister and his family from members of the public.



“We have nothing to respond to him for, because we have shown our purity in the case,” he said.



In May, the CNRP revoked the membership of a US-based member and owner of Facebook account “Brady N Yong” after he posted a claim that Mr. Hun Sen’s son Hun Manet had been fathered by a former Vietnamese leader and called for DNA tests that would prove this.



He later apologized and Mr. Rainsy issued a letter condemning the claims.
