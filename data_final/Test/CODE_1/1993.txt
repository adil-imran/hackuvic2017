Khloe Kardashian has been busy plugging her new denim line Good American.

And her big sister Kourtney showed her support on Tuesday when she stepped out with son Mason and a bodyguard in a pair of jeans from the just-released collection.

The 37-year-old, who was spotted in Calabasas, California, certainly made a great advert for it while showing some skin in black skinny jeans with large rips down each leg.

Kourtney displayed her flat stomach and much of her slender legs in the denim, which she teamed with a long-sleeved and high-necked black jacket.

The reality star also sported simple black pumps and carried a matching handbag, while looking picture perfect with natural make-up.

Kourtney had earlier been showing fans her hairstyle on Snapchat, which consisted of a bun with braided detail at the back.

She also used the social media app to let everyone know that she was clad in a pair of Khloe's jeans.
