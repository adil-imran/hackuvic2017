Go To

Golden Vale Mushrooms, located in Clonmore, South Cahir, Co Tipperary ceased trading early last week.

The family-owned business, headed by James Quinn, employed up to 25 staff and was totally dependent on export to the UK market.

At least 100 other jobs have been lost in the vulnerable mushroom sector since the UK's controversial vote to leave the EU just three months ago.

An estimated 90pc of mushrooms (70,000t), worth €120m, produced in Ireland are exported to the UK - accounting for 52pc of the UK mushroom market. There are currently just below 60 mushroom producers in Ireland, with a total workforce of 3,500, mostly located in rural areas,

Last week, members of the Commercial Mushroom Producers Co-operative Society (CMP) and the IFA Horticulture Committee warned the Government that immediate action must be taken against the dramatic weakening of the sterling.

Decline

Gerry Reilly, chairman of the IFA Horticulture Committee, said a total of €7m in exports has already been lost by the closure of three producers - two in Tipperary and one near Portarlington.
