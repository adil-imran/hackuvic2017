A Nyeri man and his nephew died in the terrorist attack that occurred in Mandera town yesterday.

Amos Njogu, 56, and his nephew Simon Mwangi, 34, died of bullet wounds after suspected Al Shabaab terrorists attacked Bishaaro Guest House in Mandera town.

The two relatives worked in quarries in Mandera.

Other quarry workers killed in the attack were a Mr Makumi from Gitathiini in Tetu, and another nicknamed MM Njoroge, who residents said was also from Nyeri.

Going by preliminary reports, Nyeri County lost four people.

Njogu's younger brother, identified as Michael Maina, 44, who was also asleep in the hotel, escaped unscathed.

Njogu's wife Sarah Wangechi, 52, was inconsolable on receiving the sad news yesterday.

"I heard the news of the attack on the radio in the morning and immediately called my husband but his mobile phone was switched off. I then called my son, who is also in Mandera, and he asked me to send him his father's newest mobile number so he could track him," she said.

CASUAL WORK

Wangechi, a mother of seven who does casual work in a nearby quarry, said she later tried to call her son but found out he had switched off his phone.

"I suspected he got the information and was afraid to break the news to me," she said.

Njogu's brother, John Ndung'u, said he received calls from friends who also work in Mandera confirming that his brother and nephew were among the victims of the attack.
