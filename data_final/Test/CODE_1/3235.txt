Billy Bush broke down in tears after audio of him making lewd comments about women with Donald Trump was released this past Friday.

A source tells US Weekly that the Today anchor quickly grew nervous that the tape would lead to him being fired from his new job, just two months after he joined the NBC morning show.

'Billy was devastated and crying when the leaked tape of him with Donald Trump in 2005 was first leaked to The Washington Post,' said the source.

'He was crying that his career was over.'

And while the tape of Trump was tracked down by an Access Hollywood producer last week, it seems that it was Bush who gave his former co-workers the idea to go looking for the damning audio.

Page Six reports that Bush was 'bragging' while in Rio covering the Olympics about a 'tape of Trump being a real dog.'

Rough day: Billy Bush (above in LA on Monday) reportedly broke down in tears on Friday after audio of him making lewd comments about women with Donald Trump was released

Trouble: The release of the tape has led to his indefinite suspension as the anchor of the third hour of Today

Family: He was seen on Monday afternoon looking unkempt in sweatpants and flip flops as he grabbed lunch with his daughter Josie in Los Angeles

Bad blood: There are reports that some of the women on the set of Today - and a few of his fellow anchors - are hoping that Bush does not return to the program.

Now that the tape has been found though, this could lead to more problems with him and NBC.

'If he knew about the tape, and remembered the full extent of such an explosive conversation with a presidential candidate and didn’t disclose that to NBC News, that is a very, very serious problem,' said an insider.

That person later added: 'It is not clear if Billy remembered the exact level of vulgarity in the conversation with Trump, or if he instead realized its news value and didn’t declare it to protect himself.'

Kathie Lee Gifford meanwhile does not even want Bush throwing to the show's fourth hour according to the report.

'She has Jesus in her life and feels this is just not right,' said a source.

Bush, 44, was seen for the first time since the news of his suspension on Monday afternoon, looking unkempt and scruffy as he grabbed lunch in Los Angeles with one of his three teenage daughters.

He wore sweatpants and flip flops for the outing, along with a shirt that read: 'Sun. Beach. Whiskey.'

Al Roker stepped in to take Bush's spot on Today Monday morning, and on Tuesday it will be Carson Daly joining Tamron Hall to anchor the third hour of the morning show.

People is reporting that some of the women on the set of Today - and a few of his fellow anchors - are hoping that Bush does not return to the program.

'Tamron doesn’t like him and they have always been uncomfortable around each other. Al doesn’t speak to him, like at all. There is no love lost there,' said an insider.

'Matt is okay with him, not friends, but okay. He doesn’t have much of a relationship with Savannah . So it won’t be a loss to any of them personally if he doesn’t come back.'

The source then added: 'Does anyone tune in to Today to watch Billy? Probably not really. So if he leaves, it’s not a big deal.'

NBC announced on Sunday that they had made the decision to suspend Bush from his job anchoring the third hour of Today after the comments he made about a fellow NBC employee surfaced in an old Access Hollywood interview he did with Trump.

While most of the offensive statements on that tape are made by Trump, Bush can heard encouraging his comments and at one point states that the actress the two men are about to meet is 'hot as s***.'

Bad luck: According to one report, Bush bragged about having a tape of Trump sounding like a 'dog' when he was in Rio covering the Olympics

The decision to suspend Bush was addressed on Today Monday morning by lead anchor Savannah Guthrie.

'We want to note one other thing,' said Guthrie at the top of the program.

'Pending further review of the matter, NBC News has suspended Billy Bush, the host of Today’s third hour, for his role in that conversation with Donald Trump.'

The suspension was again addressed at the start of the third hour as well by Hall and Roker.

'As you can see, Billy Bush is not joining us today, as you’re probably aware,' said Roker.

'Part of that 2005 Access Hollywood taping with Donald Trump that’s been in the news all weekend.'

Hall then added: 'NBC, which owns Access Hollywood, has suspended Billy for his role in that conversation, pending further review. With that said, let’s turn to last night’s debate, where that 2005 tape played a big role.'

At least one of Bush's co-workers did come to his defense though on Monday.

Bush's former Access Hollywood co-host Kit Hoover fought back tears while speaking about the Today anchor's recent suspension by NBC.

'I don’t even know where to begin with all of this,' said Hoover at the top of Monday morning's episode of Access Hollywood.

'When the tapes came out on Friday, I was home watching with my 14-year-old daughter and the tapes are inexcusable. But I’m watching this tape and I’m watching this person - those tapes were a decade ago and it was seven minutes of someone’s life, and all I can tell you is what I know and the person that I sat next to for the last six years, and that person for me is a totally different person.

'He always treated me with kindness, such respect — I mean, Natalie, he treated me like an equal from day one and I think anybody that watched our show at home and saw us together knew how much he rooted for me.

'He was always in my corner. I was just devastated to watch all this unfold because the Billy that I know - and that a lot of people would say - has the biggest heart of anybody, and he is a good person,' said Hoover.

Natalie Morales the chimed in to say a few positive things about Bush as well, stating: 'I will say that one of the first people to call me and congratulate me when I announced that I would be getting this job was Billy.'

She then added: 'He also offered advice and offered to help with my move and transition.'

Not fans: Another report claims that Bush's fellow Today anchors would have no problem if the network decided to fire him from the program

Bush, who is married with three teenage daughters, released a statement shortly after the 2005 tape surfaced on Friday.

'Obviously I’m embarrassed and ashamed. It’s no excuse, but this happened eleven years ago. I was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along. I’m very sorry,' said Bush, who was 33 at the time.

Arianne Zucker, the Days of Our Lives actress who Bush referred to as 'hot as s***' also released a statement over the weekend.

'My name is Arianne Zucker and I am a strong, independent, hard working mother, business woman and partner to a great man. I have grown to learn that the words of others cannot effect the value of my self worth or define the content of my character,' said Zucker.

'How we treat one another, whether behind closed doors, locker rooms or face to face, should be done with kindness, dignity and respect. Unfortunately, there are too many people in power who abuse their position and disregard these simple principles and are rewarded for it.'

She closed out her statement by saying: 'In understanding the magnitude of this situation, I choose to stand tall with self respect and use my voice to enrich, inspire and elevate the best of who we are as people.'

Bush is doing a poor job trying of distancing himself from Donald Trump despite the fact that audio of a conversation he had with the Republican hopeful over a decade ago has led to his indefinite absence from Today.
