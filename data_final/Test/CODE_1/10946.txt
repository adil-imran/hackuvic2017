Six years after his near death experience in the hands of suspected Fulani herdsmen, Daniel Chuwang, in this highly revealing interview with Shola O’neil, (South-south Regional Editor) opened up on a very traumatic experience and how the Arm of Hope Foundation, has turned his life around.

DEATH AT DUSK

Even by the recent standard of reprehensible killings in the country, the gruesome murder of children, pregnant women, aged and able-bodied men and women on the night of March 6, 2010 as witnessed in Dogo-Nahawa, was, to say the least, barbaric. Dogo-Nahawa is a sleepy hitherto unknown rural community located in Plateau State. A midnight raid left 354 persons dead and scores others injured. Among the survivors was Daniel Chuwang, a teenager, whose father and two brothers were hacked to death on the mad night.

Daniel was barely 15 when the killings that shook the nation and reverberated throughout the world occurred.

“I was sleeping with my brothers when I heard the first gunshot. Nobody knew what it was because it was not unusual to hear gun shot in the night. But that one was different, because it was not just one single shot as we used to hear.”

When the gunfire died down hours later, over 350 bodies sprawled all over the length and breadth of the northern Nigerian town. Aside corpses, ashes were the only inkling to what used to be house of thousands of denizens of the community. The dead, Daniel recalled, included men, women; some of whom were pregnant, children, babies; some barely weeks old. Countless others were lucky to survive; howbeit with varying degrees of machete and gunshot wounds.

As his mind travelled six years back into that dark, horrific night; the pain was apparent in Daniel’s voice, although the angst of the nightmare-filled days after had receded. His situation is also starkly different. In place of the blood-drenched calico he came away with on the night, he wore a simple but neat pair of trousers and shirt in the comfortable home of his new father and best friend, Apostle Eugene Ogu in a suburb of Port Harcourt, Rivers State. His voice was mellow, in spite of the anguish; the anger and venom of vengeance were missing. He was calm and even smiled intermittently as he told our reporter, not just his encounter with ‘God’, but his transformation from a hopeless teenager to one filled with the ‘glory of Christ’ and hope of a very bright future.

“I was born and raised in Dogo-Nahawa, Plateau State. Everything was peaceful until the fateful night of March 6, 2010, when the crisis began. My father was among those killed and I was badly affected.

“The following morning people were crying and I didn’t know what was happening because I was covered in blood. I was also rushed to the hospital that Sunday.”

His fight for life was punctuated, he said, by images of butchered men and women, the face of a dying woman he couldn’t help and his last glimpse into the panic-stricken face of his brother and relatives. “It was driving me crazy any time I see everything afresh.”

“I was sleeping, myself and my brothers, when we heard the first gunshot. At first, I thought it was my father because he was in one of the armed forces. But then I heard it the second time and I heard noises from the neighbours. I was asking what was happening, but nobody was answering; everybody was running. It was even more difficult for us because my father didn’t sleep at home that night.

“I and my entire family began looking for where to hide and when we got to a particular compound, we didn’t know that those people were there and they all ran and left me. I saw a man with a long knife walking towards me. He tried to cut me, although he missed my throat, he cut my shoulder. That was when I began running without a destination in mind.

“After running for a while, I saw a lady who had been shot on the hand and laid on the ground, bleeding. I couldn’t leave her, so I stopped to help her. As I was doing that, I saw two men heading towards us. I thought they would help me get the woman to safety, but I was mistaken because I later realised that they were the killers.

“When they got to us, they said something, but I didn’t hear them. Before I knew it, one of them struck me on the mouth and I started bleeding. The last thing I could remember was that they began cutting me.”

Daniel apparently passed out at that moment, as he said he later woke up in a local hospital. He was covered in blood and his head, arm, shoulder and back hurt very badly. He had mysteriously survived, but he would later hear that his father, three brothers, countless uncles, aunts and other family members had been butchered to death on that mad Saturday night.

He was in the hospital for weeks, but it was obvious he needed better medical attention, which was not available in Dogo-Nahawa. “The doctor said I needed to do scans and other checks on the wounds in my head, shoulder, arm and back. Even if we had the hospital, I did not have the money and my mother was the only family I had left. So there was pretty much no hope for me.” He recalled.

After winning the fight against death, the young boy began to relieve the incidents of the painful night. His questions about the whereabouts of his father and older sibling brought no cheers, because “everybody I knew was either dead or maimed.” His father, along with three brothers and scores of other relatives, as well as friends and neighbours, were all dead and had been buried in one of the numerous burrowed pits that were their graves.

“There was nobody to console anybody; everybody was mourning at least one or more loved ones. I was filled with rage and hatred for those who killed senselessly and took away the lives and hopes of my people. I raged at the government and all the people that stood by, watched and did nothing to save us.

“I hated life because of the pains it brought me and my family and the fact that prospect was bleak: No father, no brothers and no family. I wanted badly to take revenge for all the loss we suffered, for the blood that were shed that night and all the bodies that were later dumped in pit and covered with earth. I was that angry and I felt that the only thing that could make me feel better was vengeance,” Daniel recalled with a rueful smile as he lounged on a black leather sofa in the expansive home of his benefactor.

An arm of hope for the hopeless

When the news of the bestial killings filtered out of the Plateau community, Apostle Ogu, a former Chairman of the Rivers State Chapter of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) and President of Arm of Hope Foundation (then Arm of Hope World Outreach) mobilised members of the foundation for what was then a deadly mission to the heart of turbulence in the north.

Along with a few volunteers, including members of his congregation, he took relief materials and began a mission to the north. “It was a life-changing experience for me. I had never seen so much death, so much pains and agony. I witnessed the burial of all those killed and took records and names of all the 354 victims of the heartless killings,” Apostle Ogu told our reporter.

In Dogo-Nahawa, the Abundant Life Evangelic Mission founder went round the villages, collecting records of those killed, they were mostly middle-aged men, women and the aged. He also took record of widows and indigent members of the community who were affected by the killing. That was when he met Daniel Chuwang.

Of his meeting with the ALEM founder, Daniel said, “Some days later, after leaving the hospital; they asked me to come back. That was when I saw Pastor and he was giving money, food and medicine to some persons: women, widows and others. I wanted to approach him but I remember those people who had disappointed me while I was in the hospital. They came with promises that I should not worry, that they would take care of me and would be training me in school, but after that I was always back to my sad world because they never came back.

“So, when I saw Pastor (Ogu), I thought he was the same. The next day, he came back to assist the needy. I did not approach him even when others were going to him. He saw me and came to me. He asked my name and I told him; he asked of my father and I told him that my father was killed. He did not stop there; he began asking me how I came about my injuries and I told him everything.”

Thereafter, the NGO members searched out relatives of the fatherless teenager and found his grandfather and mother. Daniel said he had no inkling of what Pastor was doing because, “He just told me that he was going to see my grandfather; he never mentioned anything to me.

“The same evening, he visited my grandfather and asked for permission that I be allowed to go with him to Port Harcourt. I thought it was a joke, but he seemed very serious and asked me to get ready for the journey. He also mentioned that it was his 50th birthday and he wanted me to celebrate it with him. He told all the widows the same thing and it felt unrealistic to me.”

As night fell, the AHF members got into their buses and drove out of Dogo-Nahawa, leaving the people with high hopes. But when morning came, the hope began to dissipate for Daniel and his kinsmen.

By midday, as the dust and sun intensified over the mourning town, their hopes further dissipated. For Daniel, it was ‘never hope so that you don’t get disappointed’. He said he reminded himself of his first meeting with the man he now calls ‘Daddy or Pastor’.

“I and over 50 widows that had prepared for their first trip out of the community waited that day, but we didn’t see any vehicle and we decided to forget about it. For me, I had expected it because of my past experience while I was in the hospital. The other people started talking and asking me to forget about it. But even though I tried to tell myself to forget it, I was still hopeful; a part of my hope refused to die.

“Then suddenly later in the evening, we saw three buses with police men. They asked for those going to Port Harcourt. Everybody was joyful. I was surprised to see almost all the widows in Dogo-Nahawa going to Port Harcourt. Most of us had not travelled out of our village before. Everybody trooped into the buses. It was late; so that evening, we slept in Jos and took off the next morning and that was how I came to Port Harcourt.”

The first priority for AHF team was to get Daniel to the hospital to get proper medical attention on his wound. He was taken to one of the best hospitals in the city for treatment and had three scans and several other tests.

The journey from Plateau to Rivers states for the teenager was filled with mixed feelings; he thought about what he had lost, what he was leaving behind and the life that was ahead of him. He kept on looking back as he left where he had called home all his life for a journey into the unknown in faraway Port Harcourt. Among the issues agitating his mind were: Where was he going to live? How was he going to fit into the new society without any loved one and what did the future hold for him?

“Before I met the man of God, I had never been opportune to attend school and I couldn’t even speak good English. Even when he first met me, I couldn’t speak English; I was just looking at him while he spoke. I could understand him but I couldn’t speak English,” he said.

For Daniel, the changes that have occurred in his life have been tremendous. “It marvels me that I am in this city,” he said with a glint in his eyes.

He looked very relaxed; he has conquered his fears and he owned the environment like he had lived there all his life. “I still find it difficult to believe that I’m in Port Harcourt, but I have come to realise that this is true and dreams can come true.

“This first sign that my life has changed was the kind of treatment I received in the hospital. I knew how much money Pastor was paying for my scan and everything and I couldn’t believe it; I couldn’t believe that I am important enough to be treated like that. There were no complaints about the cost, but what everybody was talking about was what was best for me. I marvelled.”

Six years on, with the help of Apostle Ogu and AHF, a very dedicated team of teachers, Daniel is preparing for next year’s WAEC examination. He is attending a good school in Port Harcourt and is doing very well.

“My life has truly changed,” he enthused. “But what surprises me most is that I and Pastor eat from the same plate, and everybody is surprised. That is the kind of man he is. Perhaps his greatest influence in me is how close he has taken me to God. By my just watching how he lives his life, I have improved mine.

“When I was in Dogo-Nahawa, I was an illiterate; I didn’t know things I know now. I have been exposed to another life, and it made me to know what God wants to do with me, and it made me understand that my story will be heard in every part of the world. It has also given me hope to see the bright future ahead of me.”

The new found joy and hope for the future has also helped him deal with the worse tragedy of his life. He said the nightmares of the incident have receded. His anger and burning desire for vengeance have also given way to pity for the perpetrators of the carnage.

“When the incident happened to me, I thought that I would never be able to forgive those people who did this to me.” But in his new environment and after several discussions with his pastor, his feelings towards the marauders have changed.

“The pastor sat me down and preached to me and I felt the impact of his words. He then asked me if I would be able to forgive those people. Initially the answer was difficult for me; but now it is easy. I decided to forgive. These words are in my mind, ‘to err is human and to forgive is divine.’

“I know I am now a better person; I am privileged to live with a true man of God, who has taught me well and given me hope for a brighter future, not just on earth but also beyond. I am too blessed to feel anger or hate.

“When I came here, we started doing morning devotions. I would read the Bible and also pray. I started growing in faith as it has been said that ‘faith cometh by hearing’. I began reading and listening to the Word more. I even went to the new converts’ class and decided to be baptised.

“I went to class with my jotter and I was eager to answer questions and learn. My spiritual life is getting stronger as the days go on. He has taught me so many things and I want to repay him by being good and following in his footsteps.

“He taught me about forgiveness and I have already forgiven them (my father’s killers); even if I see them now and I am able to identify the killers of siblings and my parents or even those who attacked me, I will welcome them with open arms and pray to God to forgive them and change their hearts to know that what they did was wrong and to teach them to know where to begin from.”

Looking ahead, he said although his “future is very bright”, he had concerns about thousands, possibly millions of orphans and fatherless children like himself, who are faced with difficulties due to their misfortunes.

While conceding that government alone could not cater for the needs of Internally Displaced Persons and victims of sectarian and other violence across the country, he appealed to government, individuals and public organisations to support genuine NGOs like the Arm of Hope Foundation.

“My appeal to government and everybody who cares about the suffering of others is to render support in whatever way to Arm of Hope. As an NGO, they should be supported to give hope to the hopeless, so that he (Pastor) can continue his good works.

“If the government renders their support, Pastor would do more but if they don’t, he might become weary in his service to mankind. So I’m pleading to the government to help us and help people who are critically in need of help.”
