Gas-Tax Legislation

Could Hurt: Moody's

A rating firm said legislation raising the gas tax by 23 cents a gallon while cutting other taxes could strain the state's budget.

Moody's said the measure would carry a cost of $1.4 billion by fiscal 2021, along with an average annual increase in pension contributions of $711 million through 2023.

The Democratic-led Legislature passed the measure on Friday. Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, hasn't acted on the legislation, though he said he supports it.

Under the legislation, the sales tax would fall to 6.625% over 15 months and the estate tax would be phased out.

Two People Killed

When Car Hit Pole

Two teens were killed and three other people were injured after their pickup truck veered off a rain-slicked upstate New York road and hit a utility pole, ejecting all five occupants, state police said.

Authorities said they were called to the crash on Route 6 in Wawayanda just after 2 a.m. Sunday. A Ford F-350 traveled too fast around a curve, causing it to go off the road and hit the pole, troopers said.

Nineteen-year-old Jared Santillo was pronounced dead at the scene and 19-year-old driver Vincent Peluso died at a hospital. Police say one occupant is in serious condition with internal injuries and two others have been released from a hospital.
