Srinagar, Oct 11: The fierce gunbattle between security forces and terrorists that started on Monday in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pampore is still on. Unspecified number of terrorists are still hiding inside the Jammu and Kashmir Entrepreneurship Institute (JKEDI). Indian Army on Tuesday resumed operation against militants holed-up inside the EDI building. According to reports, terrorists hiding inside the EDI complex are part of a big terrorists group which has infiltrated to carry out spree of terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir. The encounter in Pampore was going on throughout the night. Two security personnel and a policeman were injured as the militants fired from inside the EDI building.

According to reports, terrorists hiding inside the EDI building belong to Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba group. The terror outfit has reportedly sent three groups of militants to carry out terror attacks to avenge the ‘surgical strike’. In the wee hours of September 30, Indian Army conducted surgical strike across the Line of Control (LoC) in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Lashkar-e-Taiba suffered the maximum damage in the surgical strikes carried out by Indian Army with assessment reports of radio intercepts indicating that around 20 of its militants were killed.

Meanwhile, the gunfight between security forces and militants is still on in Pampore. Rockets and heavy automatic gunfire were used on Tuesday morning to engage the militants. Security forces used flash light during Monday night so that no militant could escape in the dark. The joint operation was launched by the Army, the Special Operations Group of the state police and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) to take on terrorists who are hiding inside the EDI building. The 70-room, seven-storey building is located at Pampore on the banks of the river Jhelum and 12 km from the Srinagar city centre. Terrorists entered the EDI campus at 6.30 am on Monday.

According to security forces, the encounter has been stretched because the structure of the EDI building is providing a “bunker-like” protection to the terrorists. They also confirmed that there are no hostages inside since the institute was shut for more than three months because of the unrest in Jammu and Kashmir following the encounter in which 22-year-old terrorist Burhan Wani was killed by security forces.

The Entrepreneur Development Institute campus was attacked on February 20 this year too. A 48-hour long fierce gunfight took place inside EDI building in February in which seven people including a civilian, three paramilitary commandos of the Army and three militants were killed. Meanwhile, a terror alert has been sounded in Jammu and Kashmir following inputs that over 200 militants, belonging to Pakistan-based terror outfits, are hiding in the Kashmir Valley.
