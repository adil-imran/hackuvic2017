The ceasefire violation comes a day after PM Modi launched a veiled attack on Pakistan at the G20 summit.

Pakistani troops today violated border ceasefire for the second time in less than a week by resorting to small arms firing and mortar shelling on forward posts along the Line of Control (LoC) in Poonch sector of Jammu and Kashmir.

"The Pakistan army troops resorted to unprovoked and indiscriminate firing on Indian army posts along LoC in Poonch sector of Jammu and Kashmir since midnight," the Defence spokesperson today said.

The spokesperson said the Pakistan army also shelled posts with heavy mortars and opened fire with small arms and automatic weapons in the Poonch sector. "Our troops are responding appropriately and no casualties or damage to our troops was reported till the report last came in. The firing was still going on" the spokesperson added.

The exchange of fire is going intermittently in Shahpur Kandi area along LoC in Poonch, police said.

The ceasefire violation comes a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi used the G20 platform to launch a veiled attack on Pakistan, saying it is the only single nation in South Asia which is spreading agents of terror and, therefore, called on the international community to isolate and sanction those indulging in the same.

Intervening in the last session on 'Other Issues Affecting World Economy' on the second day of the 11th G20 Summit, PM Modi said that the growing forces of terror and violence pose a great fundamental challenge before the world community. "There are some nations that use it as an instrument of state policy. Indeed, one single nation in South Asia is spreading these agents of terror in the countries of our region," he said.

The Prime Minister emphasised on the fact that India has a policy of zero tolerance to terrorism. "For us, terrorist is a terrorist," he said.

Last ceasefire violation

Tuesday's ceasefire violation is second in less than a week.

On September 2, Pakistan troops violated ceasefire by firing on forward army posts along LoC in Akhnoor sector in Jammu district.

Earlier on August 14, 2016, A 50-year-old woman was injured when the Pakistan Army violated the ceasefire twice and targeted Indian posts on the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir's Poonch sector in two different areas.

Last year, 16 civilians were killed and 71 others injured in 405 incidents of cross-border firing by Pakistan, the officer said.

While 253 incidents of ceasefire violations took place along the International Border (IB), 152 incidents were reported along the LoC, he said.

Around 8,000 people were temporarily affected due to the ceasefire violations and had to be shifted to safer locations.
