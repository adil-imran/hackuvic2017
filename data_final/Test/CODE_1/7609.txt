Should the military kill these guys?

."Could there be a racial element to being labeled a "terrorist"? After all, the doers of violence in our cities last year were mainly African Americans; that action even spawned another political movement, "Black Lives Matter." But the Oregon group consists only of white guys – and we know how much the liberal media likes to dump on "white males" these days.Oh, wait. That's right. Those white guys have. Somust be why they earned the "terrorism" label. Only, there were shots fired during Ferguson demonstrations in Baltimore as well. But that's not terrorism to the lib media. That's. Not only that but, as of this writing,have been fired by the Oregon "militia."Then there is the issue of liberal "tolerance" hypocrisy, and in this arena, the award goes to daytime television talk host Montel Williams, who tweeted that the Oregon group ought to be massacred by the military.After someone tweeted that the group's real goal was to get attention, Williams responded, "Then let's give them some - put this down using National Guard with shoot to kill orders."Nice, Montel. Calling for violence to intimidate peaceful protesters. Do you feel the same way about the protesters in Ferguson? Baltimore? The Left-wing environmental groups that attack legitimate logging operations and oil companies? I tend to doubt it, considering his glowing endorsement of Michael Brown of Ferguson, shot by police as he tried to beat an officer and take his gun –a strong-armed robbery of a local convenience store.You may not agree with the manner in which the Bundy-led group is attempting to draw attention to what it feels is a legal injustice, and you are entitled to think that. But by the lib media's " terrorism " description – which it didn't even apply to the jihadis in San Bernardino forafter their act of terrorism –armed unlawful action is "terrorism."Except that it isn't.
