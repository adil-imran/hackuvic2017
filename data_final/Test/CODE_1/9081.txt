Our trip to Canberra in 2014 was for the primary purpose of researching the army service records of my father Thomas Hector Norman, 1900-1981. I had been working on a biography for several years, on and off, and needed to verify Dad's personal records against the unit records of those branches of the army in which he served between 1939 and 1945. These unit histories are housed at The Australian War Memorial.Although Dad’s army service was littered with recalcitrance, mostly of being absent without leave, (all of which is well documented in his service records), I wanted to see if there were any other records or comments made in the records which were maintained by the many units in which he served. Suffice to say that Dad much more preferred being at home with Mum, Marilyn and Jim, than being a soldier; even though a non-combatant, and still on Australian soil, his absenteeism was frequent and chronic, causing him to be declared an illegal absentee, then a deserterAt this point his Brigadier got involved and downgraded the charge from deserter to illegal absentee, but he was still eluding the Military Police. He eventually outsmarted them. While still on the run he re-enlisted, so that when the MPs finally tracked him down, he was performing his soldierly duties under a different army number in a different army unit. Overall, he had three different army numbers, and performed three times more basic training than any other soldier before or since. Again the Brigadier intervened, quashing all the absentee charges, combining three set of records into one, then putting Dad on a ship bound for the Middle East. All that is another story indeed.At the AWM I did not find anything to counter what I had already gleaned from prior research. Unfortunately, Dad’s Brigadier who officiated in the preliminaries for his expected court martial for being an illegal absentee, did not publish a memoir. Nor did he keep notes that have been preserved for posterity.Anne and I also took advantage of our stay in Canberra to visit Parliament House, the National Film and Sound Archive, the Telstra Tower to view the iconic Canberra panorama, and other places of interest in the A.C.T.Anne had not been to Canberra since our honeymoon in 1968. We have an album photo of Anne taken in front of Old Parliament House. So forty-six years later, we again visited Old Parliament House before visiting the new Parliament House on the hill. This was a highlight because both the Senate and the House of Representatives were sitting, and we were able to view proceedings from the respective visitors’ galleries. These were most interesting, because I frequently watch "Question Time" on ABC-TV, which is really theatre to the most ridiculous and over-acted extent. Dorothy Dix questions alternate with Opposition questions designed to embarrass the Government, each easy to pick. The normal business of the Parliament is a different matter entirely, and it was fascinating to watch how each politician delivered a barbed speech to discredit the other side, listened to by no-one except the Hansard transcribers. We only listened to two such speeches; firstly by a Government back-bencher when there was only one Opposition member in the chamber, who was demonstrably disinterested while studiously perusing his own papers. The second speech was by that same Opposition member who also had an audience of one. When we left the gallery, only three parliamentarians were actively representing their constituents, and one of the three was the Deputy Speaker, because Speaker Bronwyn had taken leave to powder her nose.Much the same was happening in the Senate.We had a good look around the public areas of this gargantuan Parliament House. It was only possible for Anne to traverse the halls of power by taking a ride in one of the wheelchairs parked in the lobby. We highly recommend a visit to Parliament House for anyone who has not been. A copy of the Magna Carta is on view, and while we were there the original Australian Constitution document was also on temporary display.At the Film and Sound Archive I checked that Dad’s 1939 composition “Join the Colors Today” is still listed in the collection. I had previously donated the 78rpm recorded disk of this song to the Archive seven or eight years ago.My visit to the Australian War Memorial had been pre-empted by a letter I wrote in late 2013, together with a letter of introduction written by my associate, Brigadier Graham Standish, a patron of the National Servicemen’s Association of Australia. I had asked Graham to write the letter on the basis that a Brigadier has more clout than a Private, the latter being highest rank I had achieved during my two years in the army. The Brigadier’s letter did the trick, enabling me to get an audience with the AWM’s accessions department. What I was seeking to achieve was acceptance of the patriotic songs of my father, written during WW2. The interview started with the cordiality one would expect, but across the table was a relatively junior bureaucrat who obviously recognised the difference between black and white, but he was blind to shades of grey. This was one battle I was not going to retreat from without a fighting withdrawal. I managed to get Mr. B&W to agree to refer the matter to his superior, so that I could have a follow-up interview the following day, where I was indeed able to cover all my shades of grey, plus a couple of hues of spectrum to boot. Fortuitously, the second interview went well, and the Director of the AWM, Dr. Brendan Nelson, also got involved. Not only was the AWM now happy to accept Dad’s original sheet music into the WW2 collection, but Dr. Nelson also wrote his own letter of encouragement to the Musical Director of the Royal Military College Band, to play and record one of the 1939 songs; “Aussie Boys - The Regimental Marching Song of the 2A.I.F.”. The performance was completed in September 2014, and copies have now been distributed to my sister Marilyn and my brother Jim and their respective children and grandchildren, as well as to Anne’s and my adult children, Matt and Amber. Jim’s and Daphne’s grand-daughter Emily, aged 11, is the junior family member who was taken the most interest to date, Tom being her great-grand-father.Anne and I completed our stay in Canberra (and the nearby dormitory town of Queanbeyan), seeing the sights for a couple more days. I also managed to catch up with my first cousin Wendy (nee Norman) and her husband Alan Bicker who I have known forever. Alan and I had got to know each other quite well because we both had part-time office cleaning jobs in 1967/68 when we were both scratching up extra money, in my case saving to get married. Alan and Wendy have lived in Canberra since Alan was posted there during his years in the R.A.A.F. in the late1960s or early 1970s. Co-incidentally, Alan and my brother-in-law Col Peck had earlier both been posted to the R.A.A.F. base at Point Cook in Victoria at the same time in the late 1950s.We had one more over-night stop at Albury before returning home on 28 March 2014. Our next planned trip for 2014 will be to Porepunkah in north-eastern Victoria, because Anne has successfully bid at an on-line travel auction to get a discounted caravan park deal there.
