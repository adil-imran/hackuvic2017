Geller: SPLC Blames Me for the San Bernardino Jihad Massacre

Breitbart ^ | 3/4/16 | Pamela Geller

Posted on by Impala64ssa

Media bias is well established. People are used to the mainstream media shilling for far-left causes and covering up the reality of jihad terror. But on Sunday, reporter George Mattar of The Intelligencer interviewed Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) in a piece that is far worse than mere yellow journalism. Its a blood libel: Potok actually claimed that I am responsible for the San Bernardino jihad massacre, in which two devout Muslims murdered fourteen Muslims for the Islamic State.

Mattar asserted that the number of hate groups in the United States is on the rise, according to a study by the Southern Poverty Law Center, and noted that the SPLC includes as hate groups neo-Nazi, racist skinhead, neo-Confederate and anti-Muslim groups and the Ku Klux Klan. He added that anti-Muslim organizations have been growing more than any other type of extremist group  from 24 in 2014 to 34 in 2015, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center report.

After these highly dubious claims came the smear: Domestic terrorism like the attack in San Bernardino last year during which 14 people were killed by two Muslim extremists are the propaganda work of anti-Muslim ideologues like Pamela Geller, the most visible and flamboyant person in the anti-Muslim movement, and the injection of hatred against Muslims, Potok said.

Mattar reported this outrageous libel without so much as query or comment. He made no attempt to contact me for rebuttal. In a rational world, Mattar would at very least have challenged Potoks Nazi-like rhetoric. But the world is not rational, and this is war in the information battle-space.

The further a society drifts from truth, the more it will hate those who speak it. So said George Orwell. And we are a society largely adrift.

The "blame the 'gun culture' routine" hasn't delivered the desired results so they gotta look for a different scapegoat. Why don't they just let their true colors show and blame all the Jews instead of just singling out Pamela Gellar?

The SPLC is a bunch of neocommunists. She should wear it as a badge of honor.

SPLC doesn’t include itself as a hate group and so its list is a complete farce.



To: Impala64ssa

Welcome Pam Geller to the fold. After all, the SPLC has problems with people who hold the Bible dear, own guns, are suspicious of Government, believes in original intent and the Constitution, are rural, conservative, well, just about anyone who isn't a knee-jerk liberal. According to them we are all 'potential domestic terrorists' and 'extremists'. The sad part is that somehow these Liberal hatemongers have been given access to the halls of Government as 'experts'.

Sums it up nicely.

Why didnt Mattar ask Potok about fans of the SPLC who have committed a number of acts of terrorism? Several years ago, Floyd Corkins stormed the Family Research Councils Washington, D.C. headquarters and began shooting. Why? Because the FRC had been listed as a hate group by the SPLC. Not being familiar with the reporter's work I will give the man the benefit of the doubt and assume he is lazy. Too lazy to be bothered to do any research on the SPLC before the interview so as to prepare for a substantive and challenging interview. And after all asking challenging questions might be considered hateful.

And Trump blames her for Irving Texas jihadis.

Potok looks like Karl Marx-lite. Geller looks like a real conservative, patriotic woman looks - defiant, confident, well dressed, good makeup(she is very pretty naturally), and out in front in the defense of America). Potok and his cronies look like the leftovers of Woodstock after a rainstorm.

“Hate groups on the rise” stimulates SPLC’s funders. Less hate, less dollars, less staff. Follow the money.

It is disturbing that Geller would question the Stealing Pimp Liars Center.

If they slandered her, she should sue. If she does not sue, she can’t prove their statement wrong.
