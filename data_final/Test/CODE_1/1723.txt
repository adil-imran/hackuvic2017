Latest: LA mayor says video released for transparency

LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” The Latest on fatal shootings by police in Los Angeles (all times local):

3:30 p.m.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti says a video showing an armed black man moments before he was shot dead by police was released for the sake of transparency.

Garcetti's statement Tuesday came hours after the video was released showing 18-year-old Carnell Snell with a gun shortly before Saturday's shooting.

The video didn't capture the actual shooting, which happened when police say Snell turned toward them twice with a loaded semi-automatic handgun.

Garcetti says releasing the video "contributes to transparency in a case that has raised many hard questions."

He said concerns over discrimination aren't unique to Los Angeles but it's the city's job to eradicate them "because our communities and law enforcement are counting on the healing that will bring."

Garcetti expressed condolences to Snell's family and expressed empathy for officers "regularly thrust into dangerous, difficult, and traumatic situations, then asked to make split-second decisions with lasting impacts."

11:45 a.m.

Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck says an armed man shot dead last weekend by police twice turned toward officers with a gun in his hand.

Beck disclosed the additional details Tuesday about the shooting of Carnell Snell after police released surveillance video of the suspect holding what appears to be a gun just before the shooting.

The chief said officers fired three shots when Snell turned toward them with the gun. Then he climbed a fence and turned again toward officers, who fired three more times. The shooting was not recorded on video.

Beck's comments came following a raucous police commission meeting that ended abruptly after protesters shouted for his resignation. One woman who said her son had been killed by police threatened to kill officers herself. No arrests were made.

10:45 a.m.

The president of the Los Angeles Police Commission says officials decided it was in the public's best interest to release surveillance video connected to the fatal shooting of an armed black man last weekend.

President Matt Johnson made the comments Tuesday during a meeting of the police department's board of civilian overseers. The meeting was called off because of constant interruptions from Black Lives Matter protesters.

Johnson warned that the investigation is in its preliminary stages and it is too early to determine whether the shooting was justified or not.

The video released Tuesday shows Carnell Snell holding what appears to be a gun in just before officers shot him.

Protester Melina Abdullah accused police of selectively releasing a portion of video to justify the shooting and "posthumously assassinate the character of our brother Carnell Snell."

Police have said the 45-second clip is the only footage they have so far showing Snell.

9:45 a.m.

Black Lives Matter protesters are disrupting a meeting of the Los Angeles Police Commission in response to the fatal shooting of a young black man by police last Saturday.

The Los Angeles Police Department's board of civilian overseers convened at midmorning Tuesday as demonstrators shouted for the resignation of Chief Charlie Beck.

It's the first meeting of the panel since 18-year-old Carnell Snell was shot and killed during a foot pursuit in South Los Angles.

The meeting comes as the LAPD released surveillance video showing a suspect holding what appears to be a gun just before the fatal shooting.

Beck said Monday that the video shows Snell was armed and turned toward officers when they opened fire.

9 a.m.

Los Angeles police have released surveillance video showing a suspect holding what appears to be a gun just before he was fatally shot Saturday by officers.

The footage posted Tuesday to LAPD's YouTube channel shows a man in gray sweat pants and a blue hooded sweat shirt crouching behind an SUV and pulling a handgun from his waistband. He puts the gun back into his pants and runs around the corner of a strip mall as officers pursue him.

Police say the video supports the account Chief Charlie Beck gave Monday justifying the October 1 fatal shooting of Carnell Snell. Beck said Snell had a fully loaded semi-automatic handgun in one hand and turned toward officers when they fired.

Black Lives Matter organizers are protesting the shooting outside a meeting of the Los Angeles Police Commission.

6:40 a.m.

Black Lives Matter organizers are planning a protest at a meeting of the Los Angeles Police Commission in response to the fatal shooting of a young black man by police last weekend.

The Los Angeles Police Department's board of civilian overseers convenes at midmorning Tuesday.

It's the first meeting of the panel since 18-year-old Carnell Snell was shot and killed during a foot pursuit in South Los Angeles on Saturday.

Police Chief Charlie Beck said Monday that Snell had a fully loaded semi-automatic handgun in one hand and turned toward officers when they fired. Beck says a surveillance video shows Snell was armed.

Beck also said a Hispanic man fatally shot Sunday pointed a realistic-looking replica handgun at officers.
