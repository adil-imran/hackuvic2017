Last month, Canadian security agencies foiled an imminent terrorist attack by a lone actor attempting to detonate homemade explosive devices in one of Canada’s busiest cities. This was yet another reminder to Canadians that terrorism is a global threat that knows no borders.

Terrorism is the scourge of our time.

What is frightening today is that the tactics used by terrorists are changing. Expanding global networks, facilitated by the nefarious use of social media and new digital platforms, have allowed terrorist groups to create loose affiliations and to prey on the most vulnerable and marginalized, the easily corrupted, the ill and the weak.

Terrorists can now inflict mass casualties on an unimaginable scale. The proliferation of new technologies and platforms enables a kid in Canada, unable to travel to Syria, to be radicalized to the point of carrying out a violent attack in his or her own community.

Nobody is immune from it. Innocent civilians are targeted on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice, France, or in an airport in Istanbul, Turkey.

Our challenge is to stay ahead of it. Although policing, operations and engagements abroad and vigilance at home are central to the way in which we respond to these threats, we must also focus our efforts on prevention.

Prevention against violent extremism at home is enhanced when every person feels they have a place in their community and when the community has the tools it needs to intervene. When the diversity of our societies is reflected in the politics of our leaders and the policies of our government. When we choose inclusion.

No one country has the solutions, and the threat of terrorism has unified us: we are working together to find common ground and defeat this universal adversary.

Canada is committed to continuing to play an active leadership role in the Global Counterterrorism Forum [GCTF], as well as other international efforts, such as the Global Coalition against Daesh.

The threat of violent extremism affects every corner of our planet.

Canada is proud of what the GCTF Sahel Working Group has accomplished, in close cooperation with Algeria, our friend and co-chair.

Canada will provide up to $10 million per year over the next three years to support efforts to strengthen border security, improve the security response to terrorist threats, counter terrorism financing and prevent violent radicalization in the Sahel.

Today, on behalf of the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, I am also announcing a $2 million contribution to counter violent extremism for the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund and the International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law.

There are many manifestations of violent extremism, and we must be tenacious in our resolve, united in our purpose and coordinated in our efforts to defeat all forms of terrorism.
