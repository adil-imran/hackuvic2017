U.S. Senator Tim Kaine released the following statement today:

“Senator McConnell’s pre-emptive statement that he will try to block any nominee of President Obama to the Supreme Court – no matter how qualified – is a perversion of the very notion of justice. Surely the American public is entitled to a Senate that will examine a nominee on his or her own merits. I urge the President to nominate a successor to Justice Scalia of stellar qualification and integrity. And I urge the Senate to consider any such nominee fairly.”
