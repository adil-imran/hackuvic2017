Authorities declared Ramadi’s eastern suburbs recaptured, including a road that leads to Baghdad. However, that highway runs through Falluja, which is still controlled by the Islamic State militants. The highway does, however, link Ramadi to Habbaniya where Coalition forces are located. Among the towns officially liberated were Husayba, Juweiba, and Sajariya. About 1,500 civilians were evacuated from Husayba. Dozens of militants were reported killed.

The U.S. government may be reconsidering paying the salaries of up to 35,000 Kurdish Peshmerga fighters. The Kurdistan Regional Government has struggled to keep up the payments and asked the United States for help. As much as $300 million may be required to fully fund the fighters. In January, however, the State Department appeared reluctant to fulfill the multiple requests.

A new U.S. report on the Mosul Dam warns that the dam is in greater danger of collapsing that previously believed. Although the dam has been structurally challenged since its construction, its brief takeover by Islamic State militants last year postponed necessary maintenance.

Shi’ite militias are being accused of ethnic cleansing in Baghdad itself. Christian members of parliament say the militias have been forcing Christian Iraqis to move and forfeit possessions. Other Iraqi Christians, however, boycotted parliament’s “peaceful coexistence” conference to protest the lack of security for minorities in Iraq. The militias have regularly been accused of war crimes against minorities.
