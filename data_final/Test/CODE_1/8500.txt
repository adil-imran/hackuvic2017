Why don’t you come and have a discussion over a cup of tea in my office? A Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) protester was stumped by the offer from the then-Union home minister Chidambaram in 2010.

This happened during the rare occasion of a home minister visiting JNU, at a time when the country had been shocked by one of the worst massacres of security forces: Maoists gunning down 76 CRPF security men in the jungles of Dantewada in Chhattisgarh in April 2010. Chidambaram has then offered to resign as home minister. Things were then on a boil at JNU much as they are today. A few days after the killings, JNU students organised a meeting to ‘celebrate’ the massacre, some accounts stating that they raised anti-India slogans and questioned the Centre’s anti-Maoist ‘Operation Green Hunt’.

In a rare show of unity, the National Students Union of India (NSUI) and the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) opposed these ‘pro-Naxal’ students. There was even a clash between the two student factions.

About three weeks after the incident at JNU, Chidambaram chose to speak at a function organised by the NSUI inside the campus on why Naxals were a threat to Indian democracy. In a surreal atmosphere, with black flags being waved at him and thrown at his car, Chidambaram arrived at JNU in the evening to speak inside an auditorium packed with students. He made his firm point: the propagation of an ideology is fine, but you can’t pick up arms against the state.

Without any overt drama of raids and arrests inside one of the country’s premier educational institutions, the government of the day achieved something significant: engagement with the students with a firm and articulate senior representative of the government.

Push Came, But Not Shove

Contrast that episode with present home minister Rajnath Singh’s clarion call to go after ‘anti-national elements’ in JNU with the strictest of action. The difference is stark, especially when one acknowledges the far-less-serious event that triggered matters at JNU this time: the commemoration of Afzal Guru’s death anniversary on February 9, something that a faction of JNU students has been conducting since 2014.

Rajnath Singh made his statement of not tolerating any anti-India slogans and directed Delhi Police to not spare the ‘seditious’ students on February 12. Growing dissent in political circles over the move even led Singh to bank on social media chatter and, thereby, end up citing Lashkare-Taiba chief Hafiz Saeed’s support to the JNU students — which turned out to be a fake Twitter account. Not quite becoming action even from a no-nonsense home minister.

A reading of the Delhi Police FIR in the matter exposes that the police acted on the basis of a television news programme, rather than on their own inputs. In fact, the FIR was registered two days after the February 9 protest march by students had taken place, where the anti-India slogans were allegedly raised. Police, who had gone to the spot on the day of the march, had found that the two sparring factions of students had dispersed by 8:30 pm. So, the police had actually come in after any intervention was required.

The next evening, after watching a news show, the police sent a letter to the television channel asking for the footage. The footage arrived at the police station on February 11, leading to the FIR being lodged.

Going through the FIR’s content should have alerted the government of the episode being a case of student politics rather than any serious attempt to overrun the Republic of India and create more Afzal Gurus as the government wishes everyone to believe. The FIR also notes that the initial information about the protest march was received by police from JNU’s chief security officer who had cited a letter from ABVP leader Saurabh Sharma, along with a poster of the evening event.

Sharma is the joint secretary of JNU Student Union (JNUSU), a post in the student’s body that the ABVP won for the first time in 14 years laSeptember. The FIR further notes that the police had witnessed a march led by JNUSU president and All India Students’ Federation leader Kanhaiya Kumar, which was being followed by Saurabh Sharma’s faction with JNU security personnel maintaining a safe distance between both the groups.

Jaw-Breaking Performance

However, the issue of student politics over a now annual event that hardly made it to the headlines has grabbed national attention and turned into a freedom of expression issue uniting the opposition yet again ahead of a crucial Budget session. Rahul Gandhi, Sitaram Yechury and other opposition leaders have lent their support to the students who have faced the subsequent police crackdown. It is no secret that many BJP ministers loathe the ‘JNU ideology’. But this government needs to engage with the students. A ‘mooh-tod jawab’ cannot be the template. Certainly not from the home minister of India to his fellow citizens
