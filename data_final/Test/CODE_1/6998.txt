Islamic State militants have claimed responsibility for the attacks .

The terrorist organisation made the claims through the Amaq News Agency, which is close to the group.

A statement on AMAQ's website read: "Islamic fighters carried out a series of bombings with explosive belts and devices on Tuesday, targeting an airport and a central metro station in the center of the Belgian capital Brussels, a country participating in the international coalition against the Islamic State.

Today's atrocities, condemned as "blind, violent and cowardly" by Belgian prime minister Charles Michel, came after the arrest last week of terror mastermind Salah Abdeslam, who plotted November's massacre in the French capital.

Security was being stepped up at major transport hubs around the continent, with British police forces boosting numbers at "key locations" including ports, airports and the rail network.

French prime minister Manuel Valls said: "We are at war. In Europe we have been subjected to acts of war for several months."
