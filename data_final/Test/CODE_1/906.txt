A peaceful World Habitat Day event descended into violence yesterday when Daun Penh security guards attacked and injured protesters – including an official from human rights group Licadho and a local journalist – as they tried to deliver a petition to the Land Ministry in Phnom Penh.



More than 300 victims of land disputes from more than 99 communities across the Kingdom gathered in the Dey Krahom area of Phnom Penh yesterday to commemorate the day, usually celebrated on the first Monday of October.



Their event was blocked off by police and they were told to gather at Freedom Park instead.



But as people marched toward the Land Ministry in the rain holding banners, white lotus flowers, flags and drums, about 20 security guards began grabbing things out of protesters’ hands and attacking them. Videos posted to Facebook and YouTube show police beating a man in the head until he bleeds.



Am Sam Ath, a senior coordinator for Licadho, tried to stop the violent confrontation from continuing but was also attacked by the security guards. Mr. Sam Ath said he was monitoring the event and celebrating World Habitat Day when he was attacked, suffering blows to the face, neck and head.



“Blocking is one thing. But it is another thing when I, as a human rights official, see violence,” he said.



“I forbid the use of violence, but those security guards used violence on me, which clearly shows that even with a human rights official, they will still use violence.



“So what about ordinary citizens? The government should stop denying that there are no human rights violations.”



He said the violence was distressing for him, especially because he felt as though he had he helped the security guards during past scuffles, particularly during the Freedom Park demonstrations that turned violent in 2014.



“I monitor the events. I have a valid identification and I suffered from violence, which shows the current human rights situation. They do not respect human rights,” he said.



Boeung Kak community representative Song Srey Leap said along with Mr. Sam Ath, Boeung Kak community representative Chan Puthisak, a local journalist and several women had phones, equipment and drums stolen from them or were attacked by security guards.



Sarim Sarun, a 45-year-old journalist, suffered blows to the head that left him bleeding profusely.

Kong Chantha, also a Boeung Kak community advocate, said the group was marching peacefully as it tried to hand a petition to the Land Ministry requesting intervention in the country’s remaining land disputes as well as an end to violent, forced evictions and the abuse of the court system to suppress citizens struggling with land disputes.



“To the Land Ministry and the government, please work together to solve problems for people and cancel the complaints against all citizens dealing with land issues,” she said.



Deputy Phnom Penh governor Khuong Sreng and city spokesman Mean Chanyada declined to comment and Daun Penh district deputy governor Sok Penh Vuth, who was at the gathering, said he knew nothing about the violence.



The government has faced harsh criticism from the UN, international rights groups and local civil society organizations for its often violent responses to peaceful protests.



Only last month, Prime Minister Hun Sen threatened to use armed forces againstw peaceful protests against the government.



“Some Facebook users said Mr. Hun Sen has threatened them, but I think this is not a threat. It is stronger than a threat because I can order the elimination of anyone who destroys security and social order,” he told a crowd of students on September 19.
