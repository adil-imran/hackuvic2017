The massive fight saw around 100 people armed with bats and pipes involved in the clashes in front of a local migrant center. The brawl in the town of Forssa saw the long-running animosty between locals and migrants finally boil over. There have been a growing number of minor skirmishes in the town but this is the first that used weapons, according to police.

Officials believe that the entire brawl could have been sparked as a revenge plot. Both groups battled each other with bats and pipes during the fight which left five injured and two arrested. By the time the police arrived, many of the attackers had fled the scene.

According to the officers, around 100 people were involved in the fight. Tomi Repo from Forssa police said: "I hope that everyone who has received some injury will notify the police. "Police are only aware of a very small number of injuries, but I believe that there are more."

Detective Superintended Martti Hirvonen added: "Most of the weapons were carried by the native Finns, but some of the refugees had a few striking weapons, too." Residents on social media alleged that the attack was revenge for a reported attack by two migrants on a young 15-year-old Finnish boy last week, according to local media. Tension between migrants and locals in the city has escalated to the point where the council have now set up a committee to solve the recent wave of violence.

Kaisa Lepola, chair of the town council's board said: "I hope that people understand that violence and these kinds of attacks are always wrong, on both sides, and nobody joins in with them." However, angry residents have organised a protest later this week in the city centre against a plan to welcome more migrants to recently-built shelter. Detective Superintended Tomi Repo warned: "The situation in Forssa has escalated, and the police are looking into it with a keener eye."
