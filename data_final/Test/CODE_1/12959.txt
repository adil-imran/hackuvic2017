A coroner's office has released autopsy results in the massacre of eight members of an Ohio family and all but one of the victims suffered two or more gunshots. One of the victims was shot nine times.

The Hamilton County Coroner's Office/Crime Lab said in a news release that all of the victims sustained fatal gunshot wounds to the body, including: head, torso and extremities.

One of the victims had a single gunshot wound; one victim had two gunshot wounds; two victims each had three gunshot wounds; one victim had four gunshot wounds; two victims each had five gunshot wounds; and one victim had nine gunshot wounds, the coroner's office said.

No specific victim was identified for any of the gunshot wound results.





The coroner's office said the shootings are an ongoing investigation and no further information would be released at this time.

Previously, authorities released the familial relationships of the people killed in the tragedy.

Among the victims were Dana Rhoden, 37, and her ex-husband, Christopher Rhoden Sr., 40, and their three children, daughter Hanna Rhoden, 19; son Christopher Rhoden Jr., 16; and son Clarence "Frankie" Rhoden, 20.

The other victims were identified as Kenneth Rhoden, 44, the brother of Christopher Rhoden Sr.; Gary Rhoden, 38, the cousin of Christopher Rhoden Sr.; and Hannah Gilley, 20, who was in relationship with Dana and Christopher Rhoden Sr.'s son, Clarence "Frankie" Rhoden.

Three children survived the massacre, the 4-day-old daughter of Hanna Rhoden; 3-year-old son of Clarence "Frankie" Rhoden; and 6-month-old son of Clarence "Frankie" Rhoden and Hannah Gilley.

A massive law enforcement effort is under way in Pike County, Ohio, after eight members of the family were gunned down late Thursday night or early Friday morning in what authorities have described as execution-style killings.

Authorities have said they discovered evidence of a pot growing operation on the property and that cockfighting had been taking place.
