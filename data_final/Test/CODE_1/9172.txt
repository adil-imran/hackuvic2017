At least four civilians were killed and 22 others wounded in a suicide bombing near a hospital in Afghanistan's eastern province of Parwan on Tuesday, an official said.

“The blast took place near the hospital of Sia Gird District at around 9:30 a.m. local time (0500 GMT).

The initial information is 4 civilians lost their lives and 22 others were injured by the attack,” Wahid Seddiqi, spokesman of the provincial government, told Xinhua.

Government troops cordoned off the area shortly after the blast, keeping people from gathering at the scene for fears that there might be a second blast.

Some children and women were also affected by the blast as a local school is located near the blast site, according of locals.

The target of the attack remained unknown.
