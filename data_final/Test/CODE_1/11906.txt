According to the Syrian Army, the United States just bombed one of their positions so ISIS could overrun it.



Via Reuters:

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syria's army general command said warplanes from the U.S.-led coalition bombed a Syrian army position at Jebel Tharda near Deir al-Zor airport on Saturday, paving the way for Islamic State fighters to overun it.



The air strike killed Syrian soldiers and was "conclusive evidence" that the U.S. and its allies support the jihadist group, the Syrian army said in a statement, noting that the strike was "dangerous and blatant aggression".



The U.S.-led coalition has been conducting air strikes against Islamic State since September 2014. In December Damascus accused the coalition of striking an army camp near Deir al-Zor, but Washington said it was done by Russian jets.



A strike list issued by the U.S. on Saturday said it had carried out a strike at Deir al-Zor against five Islamic State supply routes, as well as strikes near Raqqa and elsewhere in Syria.



Syria's army controls Deir al-Zor airport and parts of the city which are otherwise entirely surrounded by territory held by Islamic State. The U.S. admitted hours ago they "may" have been responsible for the attack which reportedly killed 62 Syrian soldiers:

The U.S. military says it halted an air raid against the Islamic State group in eastern Syria after being told by Russia that it might have struck Syrian government forces.



The U.S. Central Command statement was issued late Saturday, after Syria and Russia said the U.S.-led coalition had struck a Syrian military base in Deir el-Zour that is surrounded by IS militants, enabling them to advance.



The statement says "the airstrike was halted immediately when coalition officials were informed by Russian officials that it was possible the personnel and vehicles targeted were part of the Syrian military."



It says "coalition forces would not intentionally strike a known Syrian military unit." Last month, a report came out from an Israeli think tank saying the U.S. should not destroy ISIS because it's a "useful tool" against Syria, Iran and Hezbollah.







From Salon:

According to a think tank that does contract work for NATO and the Israeli government, the West should not destroy ISIS, the fascist Islamist extremist group that is committing genocide and ethnically cleansing minority groups in Syria and Iraq.



Why? The so-called Islamic State “can be a useful tool in undermining” Iran, Hezbollah, Syria and Russia, argues the think tank’s director.



“The continuing existence of IS serves a strategic purpose,” wrote Efraim Inbar in “The Destruction of Islamic State Is a Strategic Mistake,” a paper published on Aug. 2.



By cooperating with Russia to fight the genocidal extremist group, the United States is committing a “strategic folly” that will “enhance the power of the Moscow-Tehran-Damascus axis,” Inbar argued, implying that Russia, Iran and Syria are forming a strategic alliance to dominate the Middle East.



“The West should seek the further weakening of Islamic State, but not its destruction,” he added. “A weak IS is, counterintuitively, preferable to a destroyed IS.”



[...]As for the argument that defeating ISIS would make the Middle East more stable, Inbar maintained: “Stability is not a value in and of itself. It is desirable only if it serves our interests.”



“Instability and crises sometimes contain portents of positive change,” he added. The U.S. has been, and clearly still is operating under this same line of thought.



While claiming to be fighting ISIS for years now, they actually made zero progress and allowed ISIS to thrive.



Last November, Russia reportedly did more damage to ISIS in one day of bombing than the US did in a year. Russia also targeted their oil facilities to deny their finances.



The U.S. responded by saying they're bombing civilians and whining about human rights -- despite not giving a damn about human rights when they invaded Iraq and Afghanistan under false pretenses, destroyed their nations, then let them turn into the breeding grounds for ISIS.





The product of Hillary Clinton's foreign policy.

Incidentally, ISIS has still yet to commit a single attack against Israel, despite hitting America, Germany, France, Belgium, Denmark, Turkey, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Tunusia and many other nations.



By opposing Assad and acting in support of ISIS and other Syrian rebel groups, our insane regime is potentially going to ensnare us into World War 3 with Russia.



Hillary Clinton is still advocating for a "no-fly zone" over Syria, which is a "tacit" declaration of war against Russia and Syria, as they're the only ones flying over the place trying to bomb ISIS to keep them from overthrowing Assad. The US is also doing bombings, but as we see today, they're doing them in support of ISIS.







This is what passes for "foreign policy experience" in Clinton's world, the most insane, suicidal war-mongering nonsense imaginable to support ISIS and overthrow Syria for Israel.



This is why Israel-Firster Neocons shiver when they hear Trump saying "America First."
