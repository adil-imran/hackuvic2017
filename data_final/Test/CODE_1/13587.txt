MACo County Trivia

March 17th was St. Patrick’s Day

This week’s question:

In Which Maryland County Is The Sister City to Wexford, Ireland?

Main Street, Wexford

From Wikipedia:

The county town of County Wexford, Ireland is near the southeastern corner of the island of Ireland. It has a population of 19,913 according to the 2011 census.

The town was founded by the Vikings in about 800 AD. They named it Veisafjǫrðr, meaning inlet of the mud flats, and the name has changed only slightly into its present form. For about three hundred years it was a Viking town, a city state, largely independent and owing only token dues to the Irish kings of Leinster.

County Wexford was the centre of the 1798 rebellion against British rule. Wexford town was held by the rebels throughout the Wexford Rebellion and was the scene of a notorious massacre of local loyalists by the United Irishmen, who executed them with pikes on Wexford bridge.

Tweet @mdcounties or email Kaley at kschultze@mdcounties.org with your answer.

A correct answer will be chosen at random and the winner and answer will be published in next week’s This Week on Conduit Street.

Last week’s trivia stumped the crowd. Lucille Clifton was an emeritus professor at St. Mary’s College in St. Mary’s County. She wrote the poem blessing the boats which was later inscribed on the wall of the St. Mary’s College campus center.
