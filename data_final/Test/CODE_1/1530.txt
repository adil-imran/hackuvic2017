“SEEK knowledge even in China.”

Rihlah, or travel, is an important element in the intellectual tradition of Islam. Through it one sees the vastness of the world created by God and gains much knowledge.

As Islam’s luminary Imam al-Shafi‘i says in his Diwan: “The intelligent cultured man would not, in a place, settle; So, leave home and travel!”

Quite recently, the author was given the opportunity to attend the “World Youth Summit on Civilisa­tion: China-Malaysia Exchange on Confucian and Islamic Cultures” as Ikim’s representative-cum-academic rapporteur.

Held in Shandong, China, on August 11 - 17, the summit was jointly organised and supported by the alumni associations of the International Islamic University Malaysia and Peking University, Confucian Chinese Society, Zen Tao Business School, Sino Youth Entre­preneur Association, Shen­zhen Zhi Chong Culture Broadcast Co Ltd, the Perak State Govern­ment, The Federation of Malay Students Union, Ikim and Zailan & Associates.

The Malaysian delegation, comprising students, professionals and academics, was invited to partake in a cultural and scholarly exchange between Islam and Confucianism.

Later, we were brought on a tour to interesting places including Peking University, the Temple of Confucius in Beijing, and the great philosopher’s birthplace in the provincial city of Qufu.

Our sojourn also took us to Peking University, an important institution where we glimpsed Chinese people’s strong love for the sciences and soon realised that Muslims too must rediscover theirs.

“Of all God’s creatures, the Chinese are the most efficient at engraving, manufacturing, and in every craft making.

“Indeed, none of the other people matches them in this respect,” says 10th-century Muslim traveller Abu Zayd al-Sirafi in his book Akhbar al-Sind wa’l-Hind (“Accounts of China and India”).

The current geopolitical situation calls for civilisational dialogue such as this – rather, even greater discourse – as well as understanding of the interaction (ta‘amul) between the world’s great powers.

It also calls for the returning role of the Muslim sovereign states as a stabilising force, as Muslim kingdoms – including those of the Malay world – had done in the past.

As the divine vice-regency of Man requires him to subject his animal impulses under the God-given rational faculty of his soul, so too the Muslim conduct of state seeks to overcome military strategies that follow animalistic logic as well as those that reduce politics to a Hobbesian mad scramble for land, power, and resources.

The Muslim legal theorist Imam al-Sarakhsi, commenting on his teacher Imam Muhammad al-Shaybani’s work on Muslim conduct of state Kitab al-Siyar, underlines the prime importance of a Muslim country to develop the strength necessary for maintaining regional peace and stability.

In fact, Malaysia’s continual demonstration of that strength, with its memberships in such groups as the Non-aligned Movement and the United Nations Security Council, as well as various involvements in UN peacekeeping operations, is presentable as proof of concept.

However, “Unless one is intimately aware of this Chinese historical experience,” cautions former Stratfor geopolitical analyst Robert D. Kaplan in his book Asia’s Cauldron, “one cannot comprehend what motivates China today in the South China Sea.”

Therefore, let us find strength in history’s lessons. Where geopolitics fails to assuage the world’s anxiety, Islam’s civilisational language as well as historical knowledge can redress old wounds, make peace (sulh) between nations, and bring the discourse to a higher level.

We should remember that both China’s history as well as Islam’s have been intertwined ever since Caliph Uthman ibn Affan dispatched the Companion of the Holy Prophet, Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqas, on diplomatic missions there.

Later, Caliph al-Mansur would send a contingent of 4,000 soldiers to help the Chinese emperor suppress the An Lushan Rebellion.

As al-Sirafi and many other Muslim scholars have recorded, the heyday of the glorious Tang dynasty saw numerous exchanges between Muslim and Chinese civilisations.

“Never the twain shall meet,” declared Rudyard Kipling in The Ballad of East and West.

Yet, as an older, more mature, and culturally richer civilisation, China shares not the propensity to destroy other civilizations.

And just as the atmosphere was amiable in Shandong, so too do we hope for warm and continuing friendly gestures.

And the penetrating intellectual gaze of Muslim scholars mentioned above very much demonstrates the strength of Islamic scholarship as well as its ability to remain relevant across the ages.

Such testaments of knowledge should make us realise that Islamic scholarship is in itself an institution of prime importance in the same way institutions and exchanges are the pillars of a civilisation.
