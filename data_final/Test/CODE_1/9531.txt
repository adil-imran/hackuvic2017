An ISIS cell in France threatened new rocket attacks on passenger jets and a new Charlie Hebdo-style massacre in chilling undercover video filmed by a journalist who infiltrated the group.

The journalist, a Muslim using the pseudonym Said Ramzi, also received instructions to ‘shoot until death’ in a nightclub slaughter and set off an explosive vest if security turn up.

After an initial meeting in Chateauroux, a town in the centre-west of France, the would-be jihadists warned of devastating attacks that would ‘traumatise the country for a century’.

The journalist, whose documentary ‘Allah’s Soldiers’ airs in France tonight, was promised a place in paradise with ‘a winged horse of gold and rubies’.

He used a hidden camera as the cell plotted an attack in the name of ISIS, before they were arrested.

Ramzi describes himself as a Muslim ‘of the same generation as the killers’ who carried out the November 13 terror attacks which left 130 people dead in Paris.
