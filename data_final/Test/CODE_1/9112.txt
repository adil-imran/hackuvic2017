Rotimi Amaechi, the minister of transportation, in a forum, revealed that the Federal Government will probe the oil sector after the ongoing probe of the $2.1b arms purchase scam.

He said the government will certainly look into the $49bn oil money, that was reported missing by the former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Sanusi Lamido.

Amaechi said “Even before Sanusi and President Goodluck Jonathan began to quarrel, I had to leak that letter. Sanusi wrote that letter to the President in September, I leaked it sometime in January, and that letter was personal: ‘Mr. President, $49bn was missing,’ and I got a copy of that letter.”

He also said “Instead of the Federal Government to say we are going to address this, they began to debate with the CBN governor and Nigerians join in the debate. Oh, it is not possible. Now, they have seen that is possible.”

The former Rivers state Governor, was recently accused of spending N82 million on a dinner for Nobel Laureate, Wole Soyinka.

The minister was also accused of leaving the state’s coffers empty by his successor, Governor Nyesom Wike.
