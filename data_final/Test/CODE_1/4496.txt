It is believed that the video was released yesterday, and that its [sic] title takes its inspiration from Quranic verse 33:23 which reads: Of the believers are men who are true to that which they covenanted to Allah. Some of them have paid their vow by death (in battle), and some of them still are waiting; and they have not altered in the least.'

One might get crazy idea that the Islamic State had something to do with Islam, if we didnt have John Kerry and Pope Francis and all the rest to explain to us how it aint so.

ISIS gunmen use machine guns to carry out mass executions in sickening new footage, by Kara ONeill, Mirror, October 10, 2016

Horrifying footage has purportedly been released by ISIS showing mass executions throughout a city in Iraq.

The terror group has been captured on camera killing a number of victims, thought to be living in Kirkuk, a city in the north of Iraq, some 200km from Baghdad.

Moments later, the clip cuts to images of dead bodies lying on the ground. Other images show victims being shot at close range.

At the end of the clip, ISIS militants bury the body of soldier Bilal al-Iraqi. The video has been titled: Men who have been true to their covenant with Allah and appears to celebrate the ISIS members carrying out the brutal executions.

Quranic verse 33:23 which reads: Of the believers are men who are true to that which they covenanted to Allah.

Some of them have paid their vow by death (in battle), and some of them still are waiting; and they have not altered in the least.

The terror groups fighters are turning towns into no-go zones by littering them with crude improvised explosive devices (IEDs) as they retreat .
