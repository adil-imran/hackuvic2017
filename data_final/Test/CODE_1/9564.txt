“In fact, even if it means conducting it in arrears, we will ensure that our fallen heroes are given befitting national burials.

“Aside from that, we have also ensured that immediate family members of our fallen officers and soldiers receive prompt payment of all their entitlements and other welfare supports.”

He further noted that the Nigerian troops were engaged in various operations across the country in line with its constitutional responsibility, the Army Chief charged every patriotic Nigeria citizen to do whatever he or she can do to ensure the safety and progress of the country.

On the recent face-off with the Shiites group in Zaria, Kaduna State, Buratai maintained the Army’s position that there was nothing like premeditated murder of some of the sect’s members as alleged by such groups as Amnesty International.

He said, “How can anybody accuse a responsible armed agency of government of murder?

“On the contrary, the people were attacking the soldiers with petroleum bomb and other weapons.

“In actual fact, not all of them knew how to handle Molotov they were trying to use it against the Army and it back fired on them.”
