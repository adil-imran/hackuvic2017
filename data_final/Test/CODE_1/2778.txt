Horrific scenes after the guns fell silent at the Garissa University College still give National Assembly Leader of Majority Aden Duale nightmares one year later.

It was a scene from hell which will haunt me for the rest of my life, says Duale.

“The nightmares haunt me especially when I see TV images of terror attacks in places like Brussels, Paris, Lahore and the Middle East,” he says.

Today, Duale and other leaders will join Garissa town community in a memorial service to mark the first anniversary of the attack that left 148 people dead.

As Kenya marks one year after the attack, the Garissa Town MP says he remembers the events of that dark day as if they happened yesterday.

Peace at last

He particularly remembers a female student related to Water Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa who called to inform him that the college was under attack and she needed help.

“I was on my way to Garissa and she kept calling me from morning until about 1pm. I think that is when she lost her life. It was so sad that we did not manage to save the lives of those students,” says Duale.

But he is happy that today, a partnership between the people of North Eastern, leaders, their compatriots across the border in Somalia and a combined team of security forces have secured the region.

Following the attack on the university, the government has deployed more than 2,000 soldiers along the Kenya-Somalia border. The police have also been supplied with armoured multi-purpose vehicles to boost their surveillance.

Religious leaders were also engaged through the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims (Supkem) to regulate madrasas and stop radicalisation.

Duale says MPs, Senators and Cabinet Secretaries from the region spend one week meeting their local and religious counterparts to discuss how they would help the government tackle terrorism following the attack.
