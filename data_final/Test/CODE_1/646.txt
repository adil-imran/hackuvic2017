Scientists say it's 'almost impossible' that October will be lower than 400

This is considered to be a tipping point, with implications for the climate

But this year, the levels of carbon dioxide have not dipped below 400 ppm

Atmospheric carbon dioxide has reached a historic threshold as levels remain above 400 parts per million through the end of September – the point in which values typically drop to their lowest.

Climate scientists now warn that it’s ‘almost impossible’ that these numbers will fall next month, and likely won’t dip below 400ppm in the foreseeable future.

While there may be brief, daily events in which the levels fall short of this amount, monthly values are set to keep climbing as the ‘rising half of the cycle’ begins, when carbon dioxide could even break 410 ppm.

CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALREADY CAUSING DEATHS A new study has revealed the dangers of climate change are already affecting humanity and led to the death of hundreds of people across Europe sixteen years ago. A heatwave in 2003 killed 506 people in Paris and 315 in London, experts have said in a new study. A fifth of those deaths can be blamed on man-made pollution. The study led by University of Oxford scientists said there were 315 heat-related deaths in London as Europe experienced its hottest summer on record, out of which 64 were caused by climate change.

Data from the Mauna Loa Observatory show the recent daily and weekly averages in September have hovered above 400 ppm all month, according to Climate Central.

This value is considered to be a grim tipping point for atmospheric carbon dioxide, with heavy implications for future climate conditions.

While the annual low point in the Mauna Loa CO2 curve typically occurs around the last week of this month, the recent records show the levels have not dipped back down into the 300s.

This low point isn’t consistent each year, and slight variations mean October can occasionally see smaller amounts than September – but, this has only happened four times in the past two decades.

‘The low point reflects the transition between summer and fall, when the uptake of CO2 by vegetation weakens and is overtaken by the release of CO2 from soils,’ explains Ralph Keeling, head of the Scripps Institute for Oceanography’s CO2 Program, in a blog post.

‘Is it possible that October 2016 will yield a lower monthly value than September and dip below 400 ppm? Almost impossible.’

Recent daily and weekly averages in September have hovered above 400 ppm all month, as seen in the graph above. The annual low point in the Mauna Loa CO2 curve typically occurs around the last week of this month, but this year, they have not dipped back into the 300s

Even with these past events considered (2002, 2008, 2009 and 2012), the decrease during these occasions was no more than .45ppm, a value which would not be substantial enough to bring October below 400ppm, the expert explains.

This indicates that October will likely stay above this point, and as November brings in the rising half of the cycle, levels will continue to increase.

‘Concentrations will probably hover around 401 ppm over the next month as we sit near the annual low point,’ Keeling wrote.

‘Brief excursions towards lower values are still possible but it already seems safe to conclude that we won’t be seeing a monthly value below 400 ppm this year – or ever again for the indefinite future.’

The news comes just weeks after it was revealed that August tied July as the hottest month ever recorded, making it the eleventh consecutive month of record-breaking temperatures.

Last month was hotter than the previous warmest August, in 2014, by .16°C according to Nasa – and it’s passed the mean temperatures from 1951-1980 by nearly a full degree.
