Dinesh DSouza Knows About Jailing Political Opponents (LISTEN)

Donald Trump has drawn criticism following the Second Presidential Debate for threatening to appoint a Special Prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton, if he is elected President on November 8.

Trump says, "If I win, I'm going to instruct my Attorney General to get a Special Prosecutor to look into your [missing email] situation because there has never been so many lies, so much deception."

Clinton responded by saying his assertion about her emails was false, adding, "It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country." Trump, as if completing her thought, chimed in with, "Because you'd be in jail."

This exchange between the two candidates has been called "extraordinary" by some. Eric Holder, former Attorney General to President Barack Obama, likened the statement to a banana republic on Twitter:

Dinesh D'Souza happens to know something about being jailed by a political opponent. He was indicted in January of 2014 on felony charges for campaign finance fraud, knowingly making illegal political contributions to a 2012 US Senate campaign. D'Souza has also been an outspoken critic of both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton with more than a dozen books and such documentary films as: 2016 Obama's America, America Imagine The World Without Her, and his latest - Hillary's America The Secret History of the Democratic Party.

Hillary's America is available Tuesday 10/11 on DVD.

Dinesh D'Souza joined The Scott Sands Show on News Radio WSPD to discuss the film's DVD release, political prosecutions, and the Presidential Debate.

Video at link. "We don't jail political opponents."- Eric Holder. I want Holder arrested for attempted murder. Is he trying to make us die laughing?

You could also come up to Quebec and interview a few union leaders and other similar sorts of people who were rounded up during the 1970 October crisis and given indefinite detentions. When Quebec Minister of Labour Pierre Laporte and British diplomat James Cross were kidnapped by FLQ members (Laporte was murdered soon afterward), the Pierre Trudeau government invoked the War Measures Act that suspended habeas corpus and gave the authorities such powers as to detain people without a charge or hearing.

The Kenyanesian Usurpation was brought to you by BOTH parties. The Constitution says natural born citizen.

That means one who is naturally an American because they couldnt be anything else, born here of citizen parents.

Everyone in DC wanted that changed without the hassle of amending the Constitution.

The Senate passed a resolution declaring McCain a natural born citizen because he had TWO citizen parents, even though he was born in Panama.

Then Obama runs and wins based on just being born here, even though he told us on his website he was born a British subject.

So the standard went from born here of citizen parents to just TWO citizen parents to just being born here in one election cycle without amending the Constitution.

This was done intentionally because Rubio (no citizen parents), Cruz (foreign birth, one citizen parent), Jindal (no citizen parents), and Haley (no citizen parents) were all ineligible and the future of the GOP. The truth of the Kenyanesian Usurpation will never see the light of day because they all cooperated in the violation of the Constitution.

This exchange between the two candidates has been called "extraordinary" by some. Eric Holder, former Attorney General to President Barack Obama, likened the statement to a banana republic...even Charles Krauthammer seems unable to differentiate Hillary as a political candidate from Hillary as a person who set up an illegal server for government work, recklessly used it for classified information, lied about it to congress and destroyed subpoenaed material - we need a special prosecutor to return a sense of worth to the government - over half the people of the country believe that Hillary broke the law and has been allowed to skate because of a corrupt Justice Department and FBI - what makes us look like a banana republic is not prosecuting someone who was a political opponent, it is giving a political person special privilege above the law which is applied to everyone else.....

If Donald wins, he ought to have a copy of this picture on the wall in the Oval Office as a reminder of how hubris can bring down the mighty. And also, because it is funny as hell. Drudge got it right...it is the face crack of the century.

...even Charles Krauthammer seems unable to differentiate Hillary as a political candidate from Hillary as a person who set up an illegal server for government work, recklessly used it for classified information, lied about it to congress and destroyed subpoenaed material - I said that in an email to O'Reilly; maybe he'll read it! It was not her politics but her BEVAVIOR that warrants investigation and probably prison.

The campaign is over. Nobody cares about whether 0bama, Cruz, Rubio, Jindal, or anyone else is eligible right now. Focus your energy on electing the best possible president and Congress that we can, and then let’s talk.

I wonder what Dinesh had to say. I did not want to set up an account to listen.
