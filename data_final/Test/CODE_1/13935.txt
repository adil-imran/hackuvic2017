Survivors of the Atiak Massacre and local leaders in Atiak Sub-county Amuru District have called on the government to honour April 20 and turn it into a national day in memory of hundreds of people killed by the Lord’s Resistance Army rebels.

Over 300 people were brutally killed on Thursday April 20, 1995, in Atiak Trading centre, Atiak Sub-county, then Gulu District under the command of then LRA’s commander Vincent Otti (RIP), a native of Atiak Sub-county.

On Wednesday, hundreds of locals, religious leaders, politicians and civil society organisations joined hands in commemorating the 21st anniversary of the brutal killings at an event held at Olya Primary School in Kal Parish, Atiak Sub-county.

The event was graced by the Arch Bishop of Gulu Arch Diocese John Baptist Odama and the Acholi Muslim District Khadi Sheikh Musa Khelil.

Mr Celestino Tiger Kitara, the LCI Chairperson Kal East Sub-ward, also one of the survivors of the massacre said turning April 20 into a public holiday would enable the rest of the country to honour lives lost at the hands of ruthless LRA rebels.

“It’s not only Amuru locals who were killed but people from other districts such Teso and West Nile regions especially students who were studying at Atiak Vocational Technical Institute. Creating a public holiday will mean people across the country can remember their loved ones,” Mr Kitara said.

Mr Kitara noted that he still suffers from a bullet stuck in his armpit but government has failed to pay attention to people like him who have been left physically handicapped.

Ms Sabina Aparo, who lost her son John Lamony, then a student, noted that for long the government has ignored their plight despite their constant plea for a public holiday.

“We have prayed for an answer from the government in vain. Commemorating the death of our children who are also Ugandans has been left to us only while others are kept unaware,” Ms Aparo said.

Mr Luke Kenya Alana, Chairperson Atiak Massacre Survivors Association said, “Many of the survivors feel neglected because the commemoration prayers are left to them alone, they feel like their children have not been Ugandans whom the government cannot honor,”

Bishop Odama in his speech however said that what occurred in Atiak Sub-county was regrettable and atrocious adding that such violent killings should never happen in the country.

“We should bear in mind that Uganda has outlived its violent history, there should be no more violence. Even this current government must ensure that where there is upcoming violence, it approaches it cautiously minus causing bloodshed,” Bishop Odama said.
