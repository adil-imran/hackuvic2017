The Eagles of Death Metal have returned to Paris for their first headline gig there since November's massacre by Islamic State militants at the Bataclan concert hall.

For frontman Jesse Hughes, it'll be an emotional return.

"It's just I'm glad to be back. There has been such an outpouring of support for us and love for us, it's overwhelming."

Ninety people were killed during their show on November 13 -- part of a series of attacks that night in the French capital that left 130 people dead.

In December, the band returned to the site of the massacre, which had become a sort of shrine to Paris' resolve to recover.

They've also been back to play a tribute concert with U2.

"I can't let the bad guys win and I have to be with my friends again and we have to finish this. Not for anyone else, just for us."

Survivors of the attack have been given free tickets to the concert.

Psychologists will be on hand, along with tight security, to help fans cope with their own emotional return
