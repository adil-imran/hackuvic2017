Local ethnic vendors sell bagged clean air to visitors at the scenic Lianshan Mountain in Qingyuan, south China's Guangdong Province, on March 19, 2016. Many places in southern China's Guangdong Province have been blanketed by heavy smog in the past week. This has led many city residents to visit the Lianshan Mountain, where 85 percent of the land is covered by forests. Local villagers of the Zhuang and Yao ethnic groups, who often sell homegrown specialties at the scenic mountain area, have come up with the idea of selling bagged clean air to visitors. The price of a large bag of air is 30 yuan (about $4.6), while a smaller bag goes for 10 yuan.

Villagers in China's southern province of Guangdong are capitalizing on their clean air by selling it to tourists who are enveloped in heavy smog, China Youth Daily reported.

On weekends, residents from big cities in the Pearl River Delta flock to the northern regions of Guangdong, including the 1,417-meter-high Jinzi Mountain (Gold Mountain), which is known for its clean air.

Villagers in the mountain sell air stored in plastic bags at prices ranging from 30 yuan ($4.6) for a big bag to 10 yuan for a smaller one.

Zhi Chenglin, a Jinzi Mountain local, was first to come up with the idea after quitting his delivery job in the provincial capital of Guangzhou. He said he chose to return to his hometown because he couldn't bear the air and environment in Guangzhou.

Several women from Guangzhou said they bought bags of air as a way to promote awareness of environmental protection when they are back home.

"We will analyze the air, make a comparison, and tell friends how bad the air in Guangzhou is becoming," said one woman.

In the past few days, 21 cities and counties were enveloped in smog.
