PanARMENIAN.Net - The Armenian side that controls some 800,000 hectares of land as a “safety zone” around Nagorno Karabakh lost some 800 hectares (around 8 square kilometers) in the course of 4-day hostilities unleashed by Azerbaijan in early April, President Serzh Sargsyan said Tuesday, May 17.

According to Sargsyan, those 800 hectares have no tactical or strategic importance.

“From the psychological viewpoint, Azerbaijanis can convince their people that they have achieved something, but at least one soldier was killed and two more wounded for gaining control over just one hectare of land,” Sargsyan said.

“The Armenian forces were capable of restoring the status quo, but the question is whether it’s worth such major losses.”

“I'm concerned about the fate of every one of our soldiers and officers,” Sargsyan added, urging those keen on advising to go to the frontline, assess the situation and see the difference between a meter of land and a human life.

“Years ago, I set a clear task for our armed forces and the security agency to prevent any disruption or destruction of our security system. The latest developments proved the failure of Azeri strategy,” he said.
