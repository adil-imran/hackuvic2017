India’s latest attempt to get Masood Azhar, chief of the terror organization Jaish-e-Mohammad, listed as a proscribed terrorist under the United Nations 1267 regime has been thwarted by China. All evidence points to the involvement of Azhar and his organization in the recent Pathankot attacks. Last year, similarly, China blocked the India’s move in the UN seeking action against the release of Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi from captivity in Pakistan. Lakhvi, belonging to Pakistan-based terrorist group Lashkar-e-Toiba, is accused of masterminding the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai which killed more than 160 people.

While China’s hostility to India, especially in the UN, is well-known, its cavalier approach towards terrorism is deeply portentous. It will be difficult to name a major nation-state which cannot be accused of hypocrisy in dealing with terrorism. Even by those standards, China’s “technical holds” are too blatant for a country seeking the mantle of a global superpower. Terrorism figures easily among the top challenges facing the global community and all responsible stakeholders in the future of humanity—the permanent members of the Security Council among them definitely—should take this threat seriously. But China seems to disagree, certainly in actions if not in words. Suhasini Haidar of The Hindu reported (http://bit.ly/1SgDvyq) that “this is the fourth time China has blocked India’s moves to proscribe Masood Azhar and others at the UN 1267 committee since September 2014”.

What is leading China to adopt this—to use the words of Vikas Swarup, spokesperson for India’s ministry of external affairs—“selective approach to combating terrorism”? This is indeed conspicuous because China now increasingly claims itself to be a victim of terrorism. Or is it simply continuation of Beijing’s policy to keep India—a potential counterbalance to China in the region—engaged in a prolonged conflict with Pakistan? A brief survey of history will help gain some perspective.

China’s position on Kashmir

The year of 1959 when Pakistan’s President Ayub Khan proposed a joint defence with India to counter China seems like a tale from an alternative universe. The drubbing that Indian forces received at the hands of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in 1962 made the Pakistan’s leadership realise which side of the bread is buttered. Beijing deftly used the unresolved issue of Kashmir to let its inclinations known at different points of time. The joint communiqué issued during the February 1964 visit of Chinese premier Zhou Enlai to Pakistan expressed “the hope that the Kashmir dispute would be resolved in accord with the wishes of the people of Kashmir as pledged to them by the people of India and Pakistan.” The formulation was close to Islamabad’s own on the issue.

However, Chinese commitment to the cause of Kashmir has not been—to the detriment of Islamabad’s interests—entirely unwavering since then. India also began the process of normalisation with China beginning with the visit of external affairs minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to China in 1979. China began to balance its statements on Kashmir by referring to Simla Agreement (India’s preferred formulation) along with the United Nations security resolutions (Pakistan’s preferred formulation). While China dropped the reference to UN resolutions altogether in April 1990, its stance hasn’t exactly tilted in favour of India. The most recent manifestation of China’s Kashmir stance came in the form of stapled visas issued to residents of the state of Jammu and Kashmir.

China’s stance during Indo-Pak wars

Since the China-Pakistan joint communiqué of 1964, India and Pakistan have fought three wars with each other. The support from Beijing to the war efforts of Pakistan has consistently declined over the course of time. While many Indian versions claimed Chinese involvement in planning the Operation Gibraltar in 1965, Indian commentators actually praised Beijing’s neutrality during the Kargil war of 1999. The Chinese desires to disrupt India’s war efforts in the 1971 war which led to the creation of Bangladesh was pre-empted, it is claimed, on the back of the Indo-Soviet “Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation” signed on 9 August 1971. However, Srinath Raghavan has given a cogent alternative theory in his book 1971: A Global History of the Creation of Bangladesh. He attributes Chinese reluctance in 1971 to the weakening grasp of Mao Zedong, the founding chairman of the Communist Party of China, over the affairs of the PLA.

Nukes in South Asia

China’s support to Pakistan in acquiring nuclear weapons and building the arsenal has been immense. The idea was to push India into a perennial lockdown with its western neighbour and thus curb New Delhi’s aspirations to play a larger role in Asia. India and Pakistan have moved close to a nuclear exchange at least thrice—in 1990, 1999 and 2002. The US has played a role in dousing the flames in all of the three episodes. The usefulness of the role played by the US is, however, a matter of debate. If ever India and Pakistan were to come close to a nuclear war again, the role of China will be extremely important, if not as important as the US.

China arguably commands greater leverage over Pakistan today than the US. Chinese leadership will be in best position to counsel restraint if the generals in Rawalpindi begin to fancy armed conflict with India. The great hub of terrorism that Pakistan is, the deployment of battlefield nuclear weapons in recent years has raised grave concerns on nuclear security. Besides, the use of sub-conventional warfare under the cover of nuclear weapons by the Pakistan army can bring the two largest South Asian nations within a whisker of another war. The command and control issues associated with battlefield nuclear weapons imply that the situation could slip into unchartered territories very soon.

China: the next global leader?

In order to fulfil its role as a regional leader and an emerging global one, China should take all measures to prevent such eventualities. Its advantageous position with both the civilian and military leadership in Pakistan renders it best suited to execute this role. It is for this reason that the US believes China has a salutary role to play in shaping the future of Afghanistan. While battling Islamic terrorism itself in the province of Xinjiang, China also has important economic assets in Afghanistan. Both these factors will lead China, one believed, into advising Pakistan against recklessness in Afghanistan. The results, so far, haven’t been encouraging as the dialogue with Taliban hasn’t made much progress even as Afghanistan is being torn by violence.

The use of sub-conventional warfare using terrorists as proxies can destabilize the region completely. China’s assertiveness in East Asia has already given many nations a cause for worry. Its role, so far, with Pakistan has not redeemed its image either. While its open flouting of global nuclear regulations has turned South Asia into a perpetual nuclear flashpoint, its more recent moves on Azhar and Lakhvi are deeply worrying as well. In China, we may be seeing the next global power, but unfortunately not the next responsible global leader.
