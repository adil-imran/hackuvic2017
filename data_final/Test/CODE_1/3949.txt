A Bangladesh-born woman and her ex-partner were found dead at a house in Smithfield of Sydney, Australia yesterday, reports The Sydney Morning Herald.

The deceased are -- Tasmin Bahar, 35, and her partner Dave Pillay. She recently separated from Dave Pillay and moved out of their home in Smithfield which they shared with their young daughter.

Despite the relationship troubles they had recently endured, Bahar agreed that their three-year-old daughter should share a part of the Fatherâ€™s Day being celebrated on that day with her dad, the news portal quoted the family as saying.

According to The Sydney Morning Herald, she drove her daughter to the weatherboard home they had previously shared on The Horsley Drive for the meeting yesterday.

The bodies of Bahar and Pillay were discovered inside the bathroom of the house just after 12:30pm, in what Homicide Squad detectives are treating as a possible murder-suicide.

Their daughter, 3, was found sleeping in the house and was not physically injured, according to the news portal.

Bahar's sister, Sharagin Bahar, said from New York that she was in utter shock at the sudden death of her sister, and was flying to Bangladesh and then on to Sydney, hoping to take custody of her niece, who had now lost both of her parents.

Sharagin said her sister had been in a relationship with Pillay for about six years and her sister had told her that Pillay had physically threatened her and her daughter in the past. Bahar also told her that she had filed a report with police about the threats.

Bahar moved out of the house with their daughter several weeks ago and rented her own apartment, Sharagin said.

"We told her not to go to the Smithfield house but she went for Father's Day," Sharagin was quoted as saying by The Sydney Morning Herald.

"She wanted Dave to see her daughter."

Bahar's cousin, Sifat Sharmin Ruponty, said that Bahar had told her that she had been physically threatened, including with a knife, during her relationship with Pillay.

Ruponty said her cousin moved to Australia in 2009 and was highly educated, having studied science at university, reports The Sydney Morning Herald.

Police said no other people were wanted over the deaths and the investigation was ongoing.
