YEREVAN, JANUARY 20, ARMENPRESS. On 13 January 1990, after Armenian massacres in Sumgait in February 1988, less than 35 thousand Armenians remained from 300 thousand Armenian community of the Azerbaijani capital. Mass killings of Armenian population began in Baku: Hundreds of people were killed and disabled. It is not only accepted but also not allowed to speak on the reasons why in the evening of 19 January 1990 troops entered Baku.

Entry of troops to Baku helped to stop the massacre of not only Armenians but also the whole Christian population. Aliyev clan pays tribute to the honor of insurgent killers 26 years after the mentioned events.

Aliyev clan’s state propaganda machine created a so-called “Tragedy of January 20” myth connected with today impudently claiming that troops killed the "Independence and freedom" fighters of Azerbaijan.

During 3 day-long massacres in Azerbaijan's capital, hundreds of Armenians were brutally killed. Azerbaijani nationalists were killing not only Armenians, but also Lezgians, Ossetians and Georgians. Besides, the wave of violence was raised against the Russian population of the city.

On the night of January 20, 1990, one week after the massacre, Soviet troops entered Baku. Azerbaijani fighters were firing on the Soviet troops, resulting in the deaths of 28 Soviet soldiers and wounded another 100 Soviet soldiers. According to the official data of Azerbaijan, 131 civilians were killed during "The events of January 20”. However, Soviet special purpose units found a well which was filled with bodies of Russian and Armenian citizens.

Azerbaijan called Azerbaijani murderers and fighters “Shehids” (martyrs) killed during the entry of Soviet troops and as the result of Armenian self-defense.

Armenians were killed and burnt under applauses of the violent crowd in Azerbaijan, children, women and old people were thrown out of the balconies and occupied their apartments and properties. Baku’s Armenian community of 300 thousand, which had a big role in Azerbaijan’s economy and culture, stopped its existence.

Losing everything, survivors of the massacre became refugees. Azerbaijan's anti-Armenian massacres that started in the whole area of the country resulted in 500 thousand Armenians’ becoming refugees.

Azerbaijani murderers killed also Russians, Ukrainians, Jews, as well as Azerbaijanis, who had the courage to save some Armenians.

Azerbaijan’s committed heinous crime against humanity remains unconvinced. These crimes were not condemned either by Azerbiajani SSR or USSR leadership and also further leaderships of the Republic of Azerbaijan refused to release archival material on the January events.

Armenian massacres and forced evacuation in Baku is fully involved in a legal concept “Genocide” defined by the convention on “Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide”.
