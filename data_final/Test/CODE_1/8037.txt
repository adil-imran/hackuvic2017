Criminal charges to be laid against former president FW de Klerk and Adrian Vlok, a former law and order minister could open up old wounds.

The newly formed Anti-Racism Action Forum (Araf) said it will lay 22 criminal charges against both De Klerk and Vlok for crimes committed against black people for which they didn’t get amnesty at the TRC.

Araf coordinator, Zandile Radebe, said further complaints of racism will be laid against De Klerk at the South African Human Rights Commission.

The organisation describes itself as a body that brings together black people and organisations which are committed to ending racism by ending white supremacy.

Radebe said the formation was triggered by recent racial tensions unfolded in the country after Kwazulu-Natal former estate agent Penny Sparrow labelled black people as “monkeys”.

“We want to open the debate on racism and punish those who oversaw these crimes. Among the crimes to be reinvestigated is the Boipatong massacre, five kids who were killed in Mthatha by the apartheid regime, and the gruesome death of Matthew Goniwe.”

After a period of harassment, including having his phone tapped, as well numerous death threats, Goniwe, along with three others, known as the Cradock Four, were abducted from their car and murdered by the security police. They were travelling from Cradock, where Goniwe had addressed a rally, to Port Elizabeth. His burnt, stabbed and mutilated body was found a number of days later.

Meanwhile former minister, Vlok, yesterday told The New Age that a second truth and reconciliation commission was needed to move the country forward.

“If we don’t get this right, we are going to kill each other again,” he said.

However, Vlok said he had not been contacted about the planned charges.

Vlok’s position as minister became controversial after 1990 during the negotiations to end apartheid, with the ANC insisting on his dismissal. President De Klerk responded by moving him to a less controversial post as minister of correctional services in July 1991.

Khulumani support group director Majorie Jobson, said De Klerk has denied having knowledge or of ordering the commission of any crime.

“Without a new affidavit from someone who can implicate De Klerk, the case will go nowhere but stir emotions that could lead to serious tension.

“For Vlok has come out and confessed to a lot of incidents unlike his president,” she said.
