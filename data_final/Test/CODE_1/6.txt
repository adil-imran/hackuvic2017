Wielding little more than wire cutters, wrenches and a willingness to be arrested, a group of climate activists shut down five oil pipelines across the United States on Tuesday.

As of 10:30 a.m. ET, the activists said they had cut down wire fences and manually turned emergency shutdown valves on pipelines in Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota and Washington. Activists also alerted pipeline operators before shutting down the lines.

The targeted pipelines carry a particular type of heavy, high-carbon crude oil from Canada's tar sands region in Alberta.

Nine people, including filmmakers, were arrested and removed from the sites, said Afrin Sopariwala of the Climate Disobedience Center, which helped organize the protests.

She said activists had turned the pipelines' emergency valves to warn of the climate change "emergency" that threatens to bring rising sea levels, more extreme and frequent storms, and other effects.

"We have to take escalated action to match this escalated [climate] catastrophe," she told Mashable.

A recent study by Oil Change International found that the potential carbon emissions from the world's working coal mines and oil and gas fields would warm the planet more than 2 degrees Celsius â€” the threshold that countries promised not to pass under the Paris climate agreement.

Tar sands oil is considered particularly dangerous to the climate because it requires an extensive amount of energy to extract and refine. Gasoline and diesel fuels made from Canadian tar sands crude on average had 18 to 21 percent higher emissions than those derived from U.S. conventional crudes, according to a 2015 study by the American Chemical Society.

The pipeline shutdowns were also a show of solidarity for the roughly 5,000 protesters in North Dakota who are fighting to block the construction of the 1,170-mile Dakota Access Pipeline.

Native American tribes and environmentalists claim the Army Corps of Engineers violated multiple statutes for protecting clean water and culturally significant sites by issuing permits to Energy Transfer Partners, the pipeline's builder.

Dozens of people were arrested Monday near the town of Cannon Ball on charges of criminal trespass and engaging in a riot, including the Divergent actress Shailene Woodley.

Tuesday's protests targeted the following five pipelines: Enbridge's Line 4 and Line 67 in Leonard, Minnesota; TransCanada's Keystone pipeline in Walhalla, North Dakota; Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain pipeline in Anacortes, Washington; and Spectra Energy's Express pipeline in Coal Banks Landing, Montana.

Enbridge, Kinder Morgan and Spectra Enbridge confirmed that activists had tampered with their pipelines.

Michael Barnes, a spokesman for Enbridge, said the company temporarily shut down lines 4 and 67 on Tuesday afternoon out of "an abundance of caution."

"The actions taken to unlawfully trespass on our facility, use bolt cutters to cut chains off our valves and then attempt to turn the valves to stop the flow of oil were dangerous and reckless," he told Mashable by email.

"These are criminal acts that endanger the public and the environment," he said. "We take this very seriously and will support prosecution of all those involved."
