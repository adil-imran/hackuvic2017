CAPE TOWN - Police are monitoring the situation at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology's (CPUT) Cape Town campus where a minibus taxi has been set alight.

Firefighters were called out to douse the burnt out vehicle which belonged to private security.

A rubbish bin close the Engineering Building was also torched.

Public order police are driving around CPUT looking for protesting students while private security guards are patrolling campus.

Earlier, demonstrators had disrupted operations at the institution's journalism department in Roeland Street.

Witnesses say the group also threw stones at police vehicles.

They apparently also forced the closure of the campus library.

Some students say they were taken out of their residences by protesters.

At the same time, roads have been closed near the CPUT campus in Cape Town due to protests.

The City's Richard Coleman.

"At the moment we've got students protesting and we've got Tennant Street closed between Constitution and Keizergracht Street."

IN-SERVICE TRAINING CONCERNS

Some CPUT students say they are afraid they will not be able to take in- service training positions next year.

Those students who are not part of the protests are concerned about the consequence of not being able to graduate.

Police earlier arrested a number of protesting students on the Bellville campus after they had apparently thrown stones at police.

Police officials in a nyala and five police vans are on full alert on an open tarred surface between residences and the administration and other faculty buildings.

Students are now roaming around the campus, after the violent scenes that ensued between protesters and police.

Some students are, however, concerned they will not be able to complete this academic year and be unable to start in-service training jobs in 2017.

CPUT management is expected to make an announcement about the academic programme later today.
