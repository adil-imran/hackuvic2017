MANILA, Philippines - Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. has “taken up arms” to support the Duterte administration’s war against illegal drugs – at least in a photo posted on his Facebook page.

Yasay on Thursday posted his photo dressed in camouflage and holding a short rifle, supposedly to counter a meme that depicted him wearing a Chinese military uniform to criticize the present administration’s foreign policy pivot to China.

“I am with President Duterte and the Filipino people in the all-out war against illegal drugs. Tara na, sama na para sa kapakanan at kinabukasan ng ating bansa (Come join me for the sake and future of our country),” Yasay said.

In the photo, he was wearing sunglasses and a cap with an inverted Philippine flag, which is used only in times of war.

In the comments section, several supporters appeared to have taken the call for support literally.

“I got two pistols with a combined 20-plus rounds of ammunition. They can help however few,” one comment read, which also included the supposed photo of the netizen holding two pistols.

Another posted his supposed image with a child holding a long firearm, with the caption: “Sama kami dyan (We’ll join you) sir.”

The comments on the post of the country’s top diplomat are mixed between those who support and criticize the post.

“Supporting slaughter and breach of the Constitution is not supportable in any way. The whole thing is based on fake, misinterpreted and make-up figures any way,” one critic said.

“Akala ko ba di state sponsored ang killings? Ano ibig sabihin nito? (I thought the extrajudicial killings are not state-sponsored. What is the meaning of this?” another added.

The administration has been repeatedly criticized over the deaths – supposedly over 3,600 – in connection with anti-illegal drug efforts, although President Duterte has denied that these are state-sponsored.

For his part, Yasay ignored the criticisms but engaged with those expressing support.

“No buts or if, for country and people,” Yasay said in response to one netizen who declared her trust in his actions.

Yasay’s post was in response to a meme that edited his face into that od a Chinese soldier.

“This is the kindest vilification I got from my harshest critics. I am keeping this Photoshopped picture to keep me cheerful and amused while doing my job for the nation,” he said.

“I must admit though that I am a ranking proud member of the PLA – Philippine Liberation Army – tasked to separate and unshackle our people from the colonial mindset of dependence and subservience,” he added.

PLA is more commonly known as the People’s Liberation Army, the Chinese armed forces.
