Posted on by conservativepoet

Tens of thousands of Democrats hate Hillary Clinton like she hates ordinary Americans. They dont believe shell provide the changes America needs. They believe she is a liar. Many of them are breaking with the Democratic Party to support Trump.

Someone suggested on Nov 8th voting day if you are voting for TRUMP to wear RED....this way THEY CANT STEAL THE ELECTION



To: conservativepoet

Today’s Democrat Party is far removed from the Democrat Party that actually supported the working man, and woman. It use to be the champion of the Middle Class. Now, the Dem/Republican is all about global government; a government of a few elites ruling over a permanent underclass.

They are organizing right now and working to defeat Hillary according to the Dem donor who they spoke to.



To: conservativepoet

All we heard from Hewitt and Medved was Trump could never have the appeal to independents and democrats like Rubio would.

_____________ And as you clearly point out—they’re wrong.



To: conservativepoet

Looks like the hard work of the Trump ground game is paying off. I bet there are a lot more Democrats who will vote for Trump.



To: MNDude

It really goes to show how out of touch with mainstream America all these people are. They don’t have a clue.

Hell, Rubio could not even win his own state of Florida with all the Hispanics. Trump beat his a$$ there.

Wow. Where did you get that number? 800,000 seems absolutely amazing in a state of 13 million. It’s wonderful news.

_____________________ They spoke to a long time DEM donor who supported Bernie. He gave this number 800,000 within (10 counties). This donor had worked with Tim Kaine in the past also. Dem donor indicated he would not vote for Hillary. In fact, he said he and many of these Dems had organized to defeat Hillary.



To: metmom

But this morning, WSJ and NBC had Hillary up by 11? How can this be?



To: conservativepoet

PA results 2012 Obama 2,907,448

M. Romney 2,619,583 800,000 switched votes would cause a landslide in PA.

Trump Landslide coming



To: conservativepoet

Christian Rickers told FOX Business Network...

We have over a million Trumpocrats signed up all over the country. Over 800,000 that we identified in ten counties in Pennsylvania that are going to turn out for Donald Trump. If true, this is yuge. In 2012, Hussein got about 3 million votes in Pennsylvania. Mittens got 2.7 million votes. A swing of 800K in Pennsylvania would give Hitlery 2.2 million and DJT 3.5 million. I really hope they're not bluffing.

I wore a really nice red jacket to work Monday. When complimented I said I picked it out to show support for Trumps debate performance. I’ve waited years to see someone punch back at Hillary. We should all start wearing Trump red. What a statement that would make to those “lyin” polls.

Well said. The only question is what portion of dumbocrats are jailed alongside crooked Hillary.

Cause they are lying, trying desperately to convince people that she’s the winner already, hoping that they will vote for her to be on the winning team.

I hope that it goes red. It’ll be the first time in a LONG time.

“Prediction: Trump wins California.” If that happens, I’ll fall off the floor.

To: metmom

It really goes to show how out of touch with mainstream America all these people are. They are not really that much out of touch. They sense the Trump wave coming and that is why they are pulling out all the stops to paint Trump as a monster and the people supporting him as despicable and bigoted, etc. They are trying to embarrass us to "come to our senses" and support an establishment candidate who will change nothing and keep things the way they are. They fear Trump because he is the first presidential candidate since Reagan who will upset the apple cart and bring the middle class back into the economy. In fact, Trump looks to go much further than Reagan ever dared.

...”fall off the floor” Awesome reference, the world will be so upside down that you will be falling off the floor. Great analogy!

To: 6AL-4V

This is where Trump not ‘really’ being a Republican is costing him party support but gaining crossovers. The Republican party still has the money but they have lost their voters.

I live in CA, and really have not seen any support for Hillary. Now granted, I do not spend tme in SF, but do get around from LA to Redding area due to family and friends. Honestly no openly shown support for Hillary anywhere.

To: walkingdead

That’s interesting.



To: conservativepoet

Today was the last day to register to vote in Texas. If you haven’t updated your address you must go to your old district to vote and you must fill out a form to update your address to be re-instated. I’m currently suspended cause my voter ID was returned undeliverable & I have to update the address.



To: conservativepoet

Yea, I figure they are going to have to dust off the democrat California fraud machine. Gotta figure its been decades since they have had to fire that up in CA!

To: bray

Another story that will never make ABDNCFOXBS. Did you see Brett Baier tonight? He gave NV, CO, OH and PA to Hitlery. I'm just not seeing it that way. Am I delusional? Am I spending too much on FReeping?
