Cape Town - Foreign students at UCT have raised concerns about the possible impact of the shutdown of academic activities, which could extend the academic year beyond the expiry dates of their visas.

All UCT campuses are closed until Friday after disruptions escalated earlier this week.

The university had already lost two weeks of the academic programme when it re-opened on Monday, but disruptions continued.

Last week, vice-chancellor Dr Max Price warned that if the shutdown went beyond a third week, the university might not be able to complete the academic programme this year and that this would have serious consequences.

On Thursday, university spokeswoman Patricia Lucas said UCT had 5 278 international students - 2 538 of whom were postgraduate students and 2 740 undergraduate students.

“UCT has issued a strong call to those international full-degree students who need to extend their study visas in order to continue studies at UCT next year, to immediately begin work on their renewal application. We have provided all the information they need for the study visa extension process online.”

She said UCT had also lobbied Minister of Home Affairs Malusi Gigaba to authorise an extension for international students whose study visas would have expired before they would have completed their examinations, given the need for an extension of the academic programme.

A similar extension was granted by the Gigaba last year following student protest action over rising fees.

“UCT is also lobbying the Department of Home Affairs through the International Education Association of South Africa (IEASA) for this extension to be granted. We are following up closely with the office of the minister and IEASA and will provide an update to students once it is received.

Student Representative Council chairman Rorisang Moseli said the SRC had received many questions from international students who had concerns about their visas and the international students chairman had liaised with the minister.
