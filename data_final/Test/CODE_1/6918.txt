Kenyan Universities are slowly becoming death traps! Surmounting deaths of innocent university students have been reported and if what we have seen and heard from the media is anything to go by, then there are good reasons to worry about mysterious deaths in our local universities. This ranges from terror related deaths, drugs related, love-gone sour related deaths, security drills related and student campaigns related deaths among many other deaths.

Indeed, all these deaths can be reduced to zero! They can be prevented! They can be mitigated! Certainly, Universities in Kenya have become death traps! The Vice Chancellors (VCs) of those universities have failed in their administrative governance. Commission for Higher Education (CHE) cannot escape the blame! They have failed to reward University’s management by promoting a good learning atmosphere in our local universities. Poor parenting has also been associated with these deaths!

Campaigns and elections related deaths - Co-operative University College: Kenya has witnessed a lot of evils associated with University campaigns. Recent deaths have been witnessed this week at Co-operative University College. Campaigns to elect new student union officials at the university ended tragically after two students died and over 50 other students in the University's main campus in Karen were injured. This was after a bus hired by one of the student-leader hopefuls overturned as it made rounds in the institution. According to witnesses, the bus was overloaded with students, with some hanging on it when the mishap happened at 11am.

Fake security drills - Strathmore University: Security drills should be done keenly and diligently. Strathmore University faced biting criticism after a woman was killed and up to 50 other students injured when a safety drill was mistaken for a genuine terrorist attack. This caused students to be terrified and they fled and jumped out of upper-floor windows. The security drill went haywire and resulted to death of a student and dozen others taken to hospital with major and minor injuries.

Terrorism related deaths- Garissa University Attack: The Garrisa University massacre was the worst in Kenya’s history! This was caused by negligence in matters security. The University’s administration was reliably informed of the impending attack but they did not act and because of this armed terrorists stormed the university located in northern Kenya and killed 147 people. A lot more were also wounded in the siege that took over 15 hours.

Early marriage and immorality related deaths- Egerton University: Relationships that result in death have been witnessed of late in our universities. The latest being that of an Egerton Student who was killed by her boyfriend. It’s reported that a casual laborer allegedly murdered his girlfriend, a fourth year Education student, Monday. Reports say that, using a kitchen knife, Hilary Nandasaba attacked Sharon Mmbone at their single-room house in Njokerio Estate, outside the university’s main campus in Njoro.
