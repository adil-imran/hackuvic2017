Iran has developed a ' suicide drone' that can carry heavy loads of explosives and blow up targets at sea and on land, it is reported.

The aircraft, powered by two tiny propellers, can apparently fly at speeds of 160 miles per hour and at altitudes of up to 3,000 feet.

It is designed, however, to fly as low as two feet above the water, with the capability of being used at day or at night, it is said.

Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards said yesterday that the drone is able to deliver explosives to blow up targets - such as naval vessels.

The Tasnim news agency, which is close to the Guards, reported that the unmanned aircraft is primarily for maritime surveillance.

It 'has not been designed to be armed with missiles', but 'it can carry heavy payloads of explosives for combat missions to launch suicide attacks', it said.

Tasnim said the drone could fly at a 'high cruising speed' near the surface of the ocean - but could also reach an altitude of 3,000 feet.

When flying close to the water, it 'can collide with the target and destroy it, either a vessel or an onshore command centre', the agency reported.

It added: "It has an advanced military camera with the capability of being used at night and during the day, as well as the possibility of being used in damp sea conditions."

Tasnim unveiled photographs of the 'suicide drone' - which reportedly has a range of 620 miles and a four-hour flight time - on the ground.

However, it did not release any footage of the aircraft flying, according to AFP.

Earlier this month, the Guards claimed to have developed a new attack drone, dubbed the Saegheh - or 'Thunderbolt'.

They said they had reverse-engineered a US Central Intelligence Agency RQ-170 Sentinel drone that was captured in December 2011.

Iran claimed a cyber warfare unit took control of the American drone and landed it safely.

However, the US says a technical problem caused the aircraft to crash.
