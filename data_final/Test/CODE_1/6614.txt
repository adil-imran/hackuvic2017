Islamic State makes Indian terrorist its poster boy to lure youth from country

02 May 2016

New Delhi: In an attempt to lure more fighters from the country, Islamic State has made an Indian, the poster boy of the the outfit.

Anwar Hussain, a 39 year old man from karnataka's Bhatkal town was reportedly killed in Afghanistan fighting for ISIS in 2014.

The terror group has released a new video, where the Indian terrorist Anwar Hussain could be seen saying, "Jihad is our duty. For this we (jihadists) have come from several parts of the world. Despite this, Allah ensured good food for all of us. We got best of best food and friends here. In this fight Allah has given us all those things, which one cannot get, even being rich."

The National Investigating Agency which had arrested more than 40 ISIS handlers across India believes the latest video is an attempt by the global Jihadi outfit to revive the recruitment drive in India as

it had failed to attract any major attention from the country.

The narrative of Hussain's sacrifice in the 14-minute video is that he wanted his family in India to be informed if he was "martyred". In the beginning of the video, the narrator describes the background of Anwar Husain and the views of other jihadists about Hussain who say he was fasting the day he was killed.

Religious Leaders Stress Enforcement of Islamic System in Pakistan

May/02/2016

Leaders of religious parties in the country stressed the need for enforcing Nizam-e-Mustafa in the country, declaring that without it no political system in the country could ever succeed in enforcing good governance and justice.

Addressing the nationwide “Imam Noorani Convention” at Aiwan-e-Iqbal on Sunday under the aegis of Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan (JUP), the religious leadership stressed that no struggle for Nizam-e-Mustafa could prove fruitful without forging unity among religious parties. The convention was presided over by JUP president Pir Ijaz Hashmi while party secretary general Shah Awais Noorani was chief guest. The JUP leadership also announced to launch a countrywide “enforcement of Nizam-e-Mustafa movement” in the country very soon.

The joint communiqué at the convention warned the government against any misadventure towards amending the blasphemy laws. The communiqué stressed upon the need for forging an MMA-like religious political alliance to counter the global conspiracy of secularising Pakistan and amending all the Islamic legislations in the laws of land. It demanded transparent investigation into the corruption allegations on rulers, politicians, bureaucracy and other powerful elite. Reminding the PML-N government that interest was an open war against Almighty Allah and His Prophet (PBUH), it demanded the government to withdraw its petition against the federal Shariat Court judgment of declaring the interest-based economic system unconstitutional and illegal. It also demanded that controversial women protection bill of Punjab Assembly should be amended with the consultation of all schools of thought to bring it in line with the Islamic tenets. It demanded immediate rehabilitation of IDPs of the Fata military operations and demanded either Fata should be annexed with KP or declared a separate province to upgrade its status.

Pir Ijaz Hashmi said Panama Leaks were a global conspiracy to divert public attention from the arrest of serving Indian Navy agent working for subversion activities in Balochistan province, and demanded Islamabad should raise the issue at global level. He said Indian direct involvement in all kinds of terrorist and subversive activities in Pakistan had been proved time and again but the rulers had been hesitating to raise the issue before the world. He said 99 percent Pakistanis wanted Islamic system in country and not that which indulged in dance and music. JUP would bring change through power of vote and by taking the people along in the political struggle. He vowed to uphold the flag raised by Imam Noorani and Maulana Abdul Sattar Niazi. Shah Awais Noorani said JUP would not allow White House dictation enforced in Pakistan but instead enforce Nizam-e-Mustafa in the country. He said killings and lawlessness in Balochistan, Karachi and Fata were part of New World Order and asked all the justice loving people to resist the US injustices at every level. Referring to 37 Indian consulates established in war-torn Afghanistan in the cities and towns close to Pakistani borders, he said it was directly linked with the Indo-US collusion to destabilise Pakistan and spoke for itself regarding the unending terrorism in the country.

He said US, Israel and India had waged an unannounced war against Muslim world in the garb of 9-11, and also imposed Black Water like private armies comprising professional killers inside Pakistani territory to carry out the terrorism and subversion. He demanded establishing peace in Fata and Balochistan, restoring industrial and business activities there, and providing jobs to local educated youths on priority basis. Jamaat-e-Islami ameer Senator Sirajul Haq said without first banning the corrupt from politics the dream of enforcing genuine democracy in the country could never be realised. He alleged that corrupt rulers had turned Pakistan into a US colony and market for Indian goods.

He lauded the great services of JUP founding President Maulana Shah Ahmad Noorani and Maulana Abdul Sattar Niazi for the enforcement of Nizam-e-Mustafa in the country, and said religious forces in the country would never allow the ugly designs of secular lobbies funded by western countries to change Pakistan’s Islamic ideology. Siraj emphasised that few family dynasties had hijacked and kept hostage democracy in the country, adding that it was time the masses should rise against the rulers. JUP Punjab president Qari Zawwar Bahadur warned that enemies of Islam had made sectarianism as their main weapon against Pakistani Muslims, adding that terrorism and extremism had marred the beautiful face of Islam. He stressed Muslim unity to ward off the enemy advances. The convention was also addressed by other noted religious leaders.

Video Shows Jeish Al-Islam Receives Millions of Dollars from Foreign Sources

May/02/2016

TEHRAN (FNA) - A new video emerged on the social media showing the former leader of Jeish al-Islam, Zahran Allouch, arguing with the leaders of two other terrorist groups over the way of expending millions of dollars supplied by the foreign backers of militancy in Syria's Eastern Ghouta.

The video released on YouTube shows that Allouch that was killed in Russian airstrikes in December argued with Commander of Faylaq al-Rahman Abu al-Nasr and Commander of Liwa Fajr al-Ummah Abu Khalid Daqar over the way of expending at least $12mln of foreign aid in battle against the Syrian government forces in the Eastern part of Damascus.

Allouch said in the video that he received such amounts of money ($12mln) several times, which were spend for Jeish al-Islam's expenditures, but Abu Khalid Daqar, opposing Allouch, called for expending the money for all the anti-government militants in Eastern Grouta.

In part of video, Allouch and Daqar accused each other of receiving the foreign funds but not spending the money on their groups' members.

Allouch, in the video, did not talk about the sources of foreign funds, but several times underlined that "the money we received in the last five years" (since the escalation of armed crisis in Syria).

In December, the Russian airstrikes targeted the command center of Jeish al-Islam (Army of Islam) terrorist group in Eastern Ghouta in Damascus countryside, killing tens of militants, including the terrorist group's top commander who was also a senior member of a coalition of the main anti-Assad militant groups in Syria.

Allouch, commander and spokesman of Jeish al-Islam, was killed when the Russian fighter jets fired ten rockets at the terrorist group's command center in al-Marj in Eastern Ghouta.

Senior members of Ahrar Sham's Shura (consultative) Council sent their condolences on the death of Allouch, who was known as the most formidable sworn enemy of President Assad across Southern Syria, as his elimination strikes a lethal blow at Jeish al-Islam and other militant groups in Syria.

Zahran Allouch was notorious for his vast ethnic cleansing of Shias in Syria.

Allouch's death will likely exacerbate terrorists' military problems in Southern Syria, specially in Damascus province.

The Russian airstrike targeted Jeish al-Islam commanders' meeting.

Hamza Bayrakdar, Spokesman of Jeish al-Islam, was also killed in the airstrike in Eastern Ghouta.

Jeish al-Islam is one of the largest terrorist groups in Southern Syria and the biggest one in Eastern Ghouta.

Jeish al-Islam is a Saudi-backed Takfiri terrorist group affiliated to the Islamic Front a conglomerate of tens of terrorist groups fighting against the Syrian government.

Hillary Campaigns with Lawmaker Who Said US Schools Should Use Madrasas as A Model

MAY 1, 2016

Hillary Clinton campaigned in Indiana on Sunday with Rep. Andre Carson a Muslim member of the House who has said that the American education system should model itself on the Quran-based system used in Islamic madrasas.

Carson appeared with Clinton at the Lincoln Square Pancake House in Indianapolis where he joked about running on front-runner’s ticket as Vice President.

As Clinton greeted diners, Carson trailed her and posed for pictures. At one point he got down on one knee to get a better angle for a picture. Clinton exclaimed “Oh look at you!”

Carson turned to reporters and joked, “Don’t forget, Carson-Clinton!”

The Democrat is not among those mentioned as being on Clinton’s short list for VP. But if he were to make the cut, his past suggestions for reforming the U.S. education system and about the 9/11 attacks would certainly provide fodder for Republicans.

Speaking at the 37th annual Islamic Circle of North America-Muslim American Society convention in May 2012, Carson asserted that U.S. education system should implement the model used in madrassas, the Islamic schools that use curriculum based on the Quran.

“America will never tap into educational innovation and ingenuity without looking at the model that we have in our madrassas, in our schools, where innovation is encouraged, where the foundation is the Quran. And that model that we are pushing in some of our schools meets the multiple needs of students,” Carson told convention attendees.

The comments generated some controversy at the time, as did the lawmaker’s association with the Islamic Circle of North America and Muslim American Society, both of which have ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.

Carson responded to the controversy saying that his remarks were intended to “call attention to the fact that faith-based schools throughout this country have excelled because of innovative instructional methods and a willingness to engage different learning styles.”

In a statement to the Huffington Post at the time, he said that he does not believe that any particular faith “should be the foundation of our public schools,” but that “it is important that we take note of the instructional tools these schools utilize to empower their young people.”

One overlooked part of Carson’s speech that day was his complaint that the 9/11 attacks were “tough on Muslims.”

“Now 9/11 was tough on Muslims,” he said. “Those of us who were in the workplace faced exacerbated prejudice, unrelenting bias, and in many cases some of us were terminated from our jobs.”

“It was tough to be a Muslim in the workplace,” Carson added, while failing to address the more than 3,000 Americans who were killed that day in their workplaces at the World Trade Center and Pentagon by Islamic terrorists.

Growing local support for militancy has J&K cops worried

May 2, 2016

SRINAGAR: Two months ago in the February chill, when most people usually stay warm inside with their kangris, a group of Kalashnikov wielding militants on motor bicycles stomped through a massive funeral for a Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist in a village graveyard of Pulwama in south Kashmir. They fired several rounds in the air and left the venue immediately, leaving many in the funeral enthralled and chattering about it for several days. Just like their predecessors in 1990, the new generation militants have come to be seen as heroes with a cult following in Kashmir.

"A girl, who seemed to be enamoured by the militants at the funeral, looked at my camera and had the gall to ask me if I were a mukhbir (informer) working for the government agencies," a photographer who works for Kashmiri newspapers told the TOI last week. He didn't take any pictures of the militants following the sly threat.

Two weeks later, defying police restrictions, thousands swarmed to another funeral of a Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist in Kulgam, another district of south Kashmir. There was such outpour of attendants that the funeral prayers were held six times. Next day, during an encounter, a top Lashkar-e-Taiba commander along with four other militants managed to flee because local residents started pelting stones on the security forces from the other side. Such incidents are rapidly becoming a norm in Kashmir.

May/02/2016

Unknown Assailants Attack Jud Madrasa, Leave 15 Injured

May/02/2016

PESHAWAR: Fifteen people, including three children, were injured in a late-night attack Sunday on a Jamaatud Dawa madrasa in Peshawar's Tehkal area.

Superintendent Police Cantonment Peshawar Kashif said the assailants opened fire and lobbed grenades at the Baitul Mukarrama Alhadees seminary. Members of the seminary were having dinner after lessons when the unknown men attacked the building.

One of the attackers suffered serious injuries and was shifted to Combined Military Hospital Peshawar for treatment where he is in critical condition, the SP said, adding it was possible the attacker was injured as a result of firing by one of his own men. He said the injured attacker was shifted to CMH from Khyber Teaching Hospital as there were no CT Scan machines available.

The SP said interrogation of the arrested individual may shed some light on the motives behind the seminary attack.

Khyber Teaching Hospital sources confirmed they received 16 people injured in the seminary attack, out of which four people were discharged after treatment and 11 retained in the hospital.

Islamabad lawyers want quota in Shariat Court

May/02/2016

ISLAMABAD: Though lawyers belonging to Islamabad have long been calling for the appointment of a local lawyer as a judge of the Federal Shariat Court (FSC), the FSC law is silent on ‘accommodating’ persons from specific territories.

The lawyers’ bodies have been pursuing their case since 2013 but to no avail. At present, two of the seven posts of FSC judges are vacant.

According to Mohammad Waqas Malik, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association secretary general, since the FSC is located in Islamabad and several Islamabad-based lawyers plead their cases here, the court should appoint a local lawyer as its judge.

He said the lawyers’ bodies had taken up the matter with the senior judicial authorities of the country and also sent the names of some candidates having doctorate degrees in Shariah and Islamic laws to the Judicial Commission of Pakistan but they were ignored.

He said local lawyers or religious scholars may be inducted in the FSC in a similar way the judicial commission appointed lawyers from other provinces and territories in the Islamabad High Court (IHC).

JIT wants Uzair Baloch tried in military court for ‘spying’

May/02/2016

KARACHI: As the joint investigation team found that Uzair Baloch had allegedly worked for an Iranian intelligence agency, it has recommended that the head of the outlawed Peoples Amn Committee be tried by a military court for ‘espionage’, it emerged on Sunday.

The JIT report signed by representatives of the Sindh police, Rangers and intelligence agencies was sent to the home department on April 29 for “perusal and necessary action”.

According to the JIT report, a copy of which is available with Dawn, Uzair Baloch was involved in “espionage activities by providing secret information regarding army installations and officials to foreign agents (Iranian intelligence officers) which is a violation of the Official Secret Act 1923”.

The report quoted the Lyari gangster as telling the members of the JIT that he fled to Iran after the Rangers launched an operation in Karachi in 2013. “He was living with his friend, Malik Baloch, in Chabahar, where he met Haji Nasir who held dual nationality.”

Nasir offered Uzair to shift to Tehran permanently where he would be provided a residence with no cost, as Nasir had “good relations with Iranian intelligence officers and he can arrange his meeting with them”.

ISIL Centers Hit Hard by Syrian Army in Sweida

May/02/2016

TEHRAN (FNA)- The ISIL terrorist group suffered a heavy death toll and its military equipment sustained major damage in the Syrian military forces' offensives Northeast of Sweida province.

The Syrian soldiers stormed the ISIL positions near the small town of al-Qaser, which not only claimed the lives of several militants but destroyed their military hardware and machinegun-equipped vehicles in large scale.

In relevant developments in the Southern province on Saturday, the Syrian Army troops and National Defense Forces (NDF) carried out joint offensives in the Eastern territories of Sweida province and forced the ISIL terrorist group to pull its forces back from more hilltops there.

6 Potential Threats of Military Attack Deterred by Iranian Armed Forces' Power

May/02/2016

TEHRAN (FNA)- Deputy Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Major General Mohammad Baqeri said 6 highly likely military attacks on Iran have been deterred in the last two decades due to the country's deterrence, including its missile, power.

"After the end of the sacred defense (the Iraqi-imposed war against Iran 1980-1988), we have come under the threat of military aggression 6 times," General Baqeri said, addressing a ceremony in Tehran on Monday.

He reminded the American officials' admission of their plots to attack Iran in the past, and said all their war plans failed due to the opposition of "the political class (in the US), on one hand, and our missile, naval and defensive deterrence, on the other hand".

General Baqeri warned that while the threat of military attack against Iran has faded out today, the enemies are seeking an opportunity to implement their ominous plots as soon as they find the country in a weak defensive position.

Leader's Top Military Aide Stresses US-Led Coalition's Failure in Region

May/02/2016

TEHRAN (FNA)- Top Military Aide to the Iranian Supreme Leader Major General Yahya Rahim Safavi underlined that the US-led coalition which claims to be fighting against the terrorist groups in the region has not been able to reach its goals.

"The US-led coalition couldn’t attain its goals in the past five years," Rahim Safavi said, addressing a gathering in the Northern city of Rasht on Sunday afternoon.

Noting that the coalition which is being led by Iran, Syria, Iraq and Hezbollah is gaining victories instead, he said, "Iran doesn’t want (enemies make) any change in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon which are the pivots of resistance."

In relevant remarks in April, Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei said certain powers, the United States in particular, are neither sincere nor serious in the war on terrorism and extremism.

Ayatollah Khamenei made the remarks in a meeting with Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev in Tehran.

Saudi Binladin Group employees set fire to buses in protest

May/02/2016

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Employees at the Saudi Binladin Group, a construction giant, have set fire to more than seven company buses in the latest protest by disgruntled staff over not being paid salaries for months and a large round of reported layoffs.

Maj. Nayef al-Sharif, the spokesman for the Civil Defense in the city of Mecca, said late Saturday that firefighters put out the blaze without any injuries reported.

The Binladin Group has not issued any statements about the reported layoffs or the unrest. Calls and an email request for comment to the company were not immediately returned.

For several weeks, thousands of the firm's employees have been staging rare protests in Mecca and the Red Sea coastal city of Jiddah, with some saying they have not been paid for six months.

Iran Ready to Settle Crisis in Aleppo

May/02/2016

TEHRAN (FNA)- The Iranian foreign ministry on Monday voiced serious concern about the current humanitarian crisis in Aleppo, and underlined Tehran's readiness to settle the problems in Syria through political means.

"Serious measures by all influential sides are needed to control the crisis. Continued crisis will lead to continued disaster," Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hossein Jaberi Ansari told reporters in his weekly press conference in Tehran.

"Iran considers continued crisis in Syria as a ground for continued humanitarian disaster and has explicitly announced its preparedness to settle the crisis politically," he added.

Syria's largest city, Aleppo, which is the scene of fierce fighting between the government and terrorist groups, specially the Al-Nusra Front, has been brought to the brink of a humanitarian crisis.

The aid lifeline that delivers supplies to thousands of Syrians is at risk in the deteriorating conditions.

ISIL Intensifies Attacks as Loses Territory

May/02/2016

TEHRAN (FNA)- ISIL attacks have increased this year, particularly in Iraq and Syria as the group responds to substantial territorial losses, a US-based analysis firm IHS said.

There were 891 attacks during the first quarter of 2016 in neighbors Iraq and Syria, more than in any three-month period since the militants' sweeping advance in mid-2014, IHS said in a new report, News United reported.

Those attacks killed 2,150 people, a 44 percent rise over the previous three months and the highest quarterly toll in nearly a year.

"The group is resorting more and more to mass-casualty violence as it comes under heavy pressure from multiple angles," said Matthew Henman, head of IHS Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Center.

Hillary Campaigns with Lawmaker Who Said US Schools Should Use Madrasas as A Model

MAY 1, 2016

Hillary Clinton campaigned in Indiana on Sunday with Rep. Andre Carson a Muslim member of the House who has said that the American education system should model itself on the Quran-based system used in Islamic madrasas.

Carson appeared with Clinton at the Lincoln Square Pancake House in Indianapolis where he joked about running on front-runner’s ticket as Vice President.

As Clinton greeted diners, Carson trailed her and posed for pictures. At one point he got down on one knee to get a better angle for a picture. Clinton exclaimed “Oh look at you!”

Carson turned to reporters and joked, “Don’t forget, Carson-Clinton!”

The Democrat is not among those mentioned as being on Clinton’s short list for VP. But if he were to make the cut, his past suggestions for reforming the U.S. education system and about the 9/11 attacks would certainly provide fodder for Republicans.

Islamic State hackers publish hit list of US drone pilots

MAY 2, 2016

Islamic State hackers have published a “hit list” of dozens of US military personnel purportedly involved in drone strikes against terrorists in Syria and Iraq.

At the weekend, a group calling itself the ­“Islamic State Hacking Division” circulated online the names, home addresses and photographs of more than 70 US staff, including women. It urged supporters: “Kill them wherever they are, knock on their doors and behead them, stab them, shoot them in the face or bomb them.”

The group also claimed that it might have a mole in Britain’s Ministry of Defence and threatened to publish “secret intellig­ence” in the future that could identify RAF drone operators. The claim could not be verified.

The hacking division was previously led by Junaid Hussain, a computer hacker from Birmingham who was killed by a US drone strike in Syria last August after he was discovered to be orchestrating attacks against the West.

Even an Ex-Mayor Can’t Build a Mosque in New Jersey Town

2-5-16

M. Ali Chaudry was more than accepted in his New Jersey town—he was its mayor! But when he tried to build a mosque, something changed.

For the last few years my efforts to counter anti-Muslim bigotry have been grounded upon the hope that if a person has a Muslim friend, he or she will have a more positive view of Muslims overall. In fact, a December poll supports that very thesis, finding a 20-plus percent more favorable view of Islam and Muslims by Americans who know a Muslim when compared to people who don’t.

That’s what makes the mosque controversy in the upscale town of Bernards Township, New Jersey so astounding. The person spearheading the mosque, M. Ali Chaudry, is not only known by the community, but well liked. After all, he served as mayor of the town in 2004. And before that Chaudry, who has lived in Bernards Township since 1976, was elected to the town council twice as well as its Board of Education. Add to that Chaudry is a Republican in a GOP controlled town.

ISIS Hackers Publishes Hit List Of Over 70 US Military Personnel

May 2, 2016

ISIS hackers have published a "hit list" of over 70 US military personnel who have been involved in drone strikes against terror targets in Syria and asked their followers to "kill them wherever they are".

According to 'The Sunday Times', the hackers have links with Britain and call themselves 'Islamic State Hacking Division' and circulated online the names, home addresses and photographs of more than 70 US staff, including women and urged supporters: "Kill them wherever they are, knock on their doors and behead them, stab them, shoot them in the face or bomb them."

The group also claimed that it might have a mole in the UK's Ministry of Defence and threatened to publish "secret intelligence" in the future that could identify Britain's Royal Air Force (RAF) drone operators.

The new hit list features the ISIS flag above the heading: 'Target - United States Military' and the document, circulated via Twitter and posted on the JustPaste website, states: "You crusaders that can only attack the soldiers of the Islamic State with joysticks and consoles, die in your rage!

'Allah's Soldiers': How 'Lost, Frustrated, Suicidal Youths' Are Used For Jihad

May 2, 2016

PARIS: A French journalist infiltrated a cell of would-be jihadists, filming them with a hidden camera as they plotted an attack in the name of the Islamic State group, before they were arrested.

The journalist, a Muslim using the pseudonym Said Ramzi, carried out the investigation for a documentary entitled "Allah's Soldiers" which gives an insight into the minds of young jihadists, and will be shown in France on Monday night.

Ramzi describes himself as a Muslim "of the same generation as the killers" who carried out the November 13 terror attacks which left 130 people dead in Paris.

"My goal was to understand what was going on inside their heads," he said.

"One of the main lessons was that I never saw any Islam in this affair. No will to improve the world. Only lost, frustrated, suicidal, easily manipulated youths.

"They had the misfortune of being born in the era that the Islamic State exists. It is very sad. They are youngsters who are looking for something and that is what they found."

To make contact with the group, Ramzi said the first steps were easy, following and interacting with those preaching jihad on Facebook.

Jeremy Corbyn Refuses To Denounce Terrorist 'Friends' Hamas and Hezbollah

2 MAY 2016

eremy Corbyn has vowed to continue talking to terrorist organisations Hamas and Hezbollah, in comments that threaten to further destabilise his leadership ahead of the local elections.

The Labour leader refused to denounce the groups in the wake of calls from Jewish leaders, the Israeli Ambassador and members of his own party to distance himself from those with anti-Semitic views.

He has previously referred to the organisations as "friends", despite both being declared terrorist groups by the EU and America.

Mr Corbyn's handling of the row has led to claims that John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is waiting in the wings to launch an "organised takeover" as leader if Labour MPs launch a coup.

Sources claim an agreement has been struck between the two men in a bid to preserve the left-wing motives of Mr Corbyn's leadership.

Germany’s AfD Adopts Anti-Islam Stance at Party Conference

1 MAY 2016

BERLIN—Germany’s upstart Alternative for Germany party on Sunday adopted a clear anti-Islam stance in a platform that lays the foundation for the populist party’s bid to win parliamentary seats in federal elections next year.

The manifesto adopted by members gathered in Stuttgart for a party conference states that “Islam is not a part of Germany” and rejects minarets and the Muslim call to prayer—the clearest move yet by the party to harness widespread concern in Europe’s largest country about steeply rising refugee numbers in recent years.

Founded in 2013, the AfD has surged in popularity amid the migrant crisis, benefiting from growing concerns among Germans over how the country will manage to integrate the more than one million migrants that arrived last year alone.

The party is now represented in eight of 16 German states and scored record votes in three state elections in March with a campaign focused on opposition to Angela Merkel’s open-door migrant policy.

‘No more mosques’ sticker from the National Front sparks outrage in South Shields

Mon May 02 2016

An activist in the Muslim community says people who posted stickers around South Shields calling for mosques to be banned are trying to ‘create disharmony’.

Shah Lalon Amin, chair of the Refugee Aid Network, is upset that messages from the National Front have appeared in the town.

The sticker features a no smoking-style symbol showing a silhouette of a mosque, and the words ‘Vote National Front’ and ‘no more mosques!’

One was spotted stuck to a lamp post opposite Waterloo Square, in the town centre.

Lalon said: “It’s creating disharmony and it’s creating fear. It’s something that shouldn’t be tolerated. It’s demonising a place of worship and action should be taken against crimes like this.

German and French foreign ministers pledge support for Mali

02.05.2016

France's Jean-Marc Ayrault and Germany's Frank-Walter Steinmeier have started their West African tour in Mali. Both have underlined their countries' commitment to the further stabilization of the region.

Following a delay of more than three hours due to a burst airplane tire, foreign ministers Jean-Marc Ayrault and Frank-Walter Steinmeier arrived in Mali late on Sunday.

"We have come on this symbolic visit to demonstrate France and Germany's determination to support the ongoing peace and development processes," Ayrault said shortly after arriving at the airport in Mali's capital, Bamako.

Steinmeier also praised Mali's peace agreement between government and rebel groups, but cautioned that there was "still much to do to actually implement the peace process."

For several months in 2012, northern Mali was taken over by Islamic rebel groups before being recaptured in early 2013 with the help of French-led troops.

East Africa: Press Freedom in Tanzania Highest in EA - Minister

01.05.2016

Dodoma — Tanzania is leading in the East African Community (EAC) region in guaranteeing the freedom of the press as provided for in the Constitution, Minister of Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, Mr Nape Nnauye, has said.

Mr Nnauye told the National Assembly here yesterday that a report conducted in 180 countries as far as freedom of press was concerned by independent journalists also ranked Tanzania in the 11th position in Africa and was in the 71st positions worldwide.

Debating budget estimates of the President's Office, the minister said, "These results show that we are doing very well as a country in guiding and preserving freedom of the press. This contradicts claims that we have been undermining freedom of the press."

He also reacted to some concerned Members of Parliament (MPs), who had advanced that the executive was interfering in the functions, duties and powers of the Parliament, particularly regarding the establishment of a studio to control broadcasts of Bunge sessions before they were aired by other radio and television stations.

Ethiopia one of four notorious countries for journalists in Africa

May 2, 2016

One key measure of a country’s levels of freedom and democracy is how the government treats journalists and how free they are to do their work.

Sadly, based on a range of measures, including number of deaths, detention and government control of the media, the situation for journalists has worsened in the world.

Three organisations monitor press freedom across the world. They are the Committee to Protect Journalists, Freedom House and Reporters without Borders. All use similar indicators: how many journalists have been killed and jailed, how many media outlets are government owned, how many are independent, how many news outlets were sued for libel, and what kind of freedom of information and expression laws a country has.

In the past decade there has been no real change for most countries’ press freedom scores. The same offenders in the Middle East, the East and Africa show up time and again, while some go up a few notches and others down.

Philippine militants threatened to slit our throats, says freed Indonesian hostage

Mon May 02 2016

JAKARTA (AFP) - An Indonesian sailor told on Monday (May 2) how Philippine Islamic militants threatened to slit his throat during a terrifying kidnap ordeal, a day after he and nine other crew members were released.

The sailors were freed on Sunday in the strife-torn southern Philippines after more than a month in the hands of Abu Sayyaf militants, and flew back to Jakarta.

Crew member Julian Philip described how they were taken hostage by eight militants disguised in Philippine police uniforms, who boarded the tug from speedboats and tied up the sailors.

The barge was then abandoned, and the Indonesians were taken to an island and divided into two groups. They were moved every few days to avoid the military, which has launched an assault against Abu Sayyaf.

Islamist terrorism: chilling echoes of Pastor Niemoller

Mon May 02 2016

As a woman of Pakistani/Indian, Muslim heritage I have remained blissfully untouched by the sectarianism that is claiming the lives of so many in our communities. The shock and horror at the daily threats, violence and murder seem all the more frightening as, like many of the same heritage, my extended family is made up of Sunnis, Shias, Ahmadis, people of other faiths, and non-believers. Communities that once lived together and inter-married are now being made separate by the poisonous spread of Islamist ideologies. Sectarianism is not unique to Islam but the violence perpetrated in its name knows no bounds. Its targets are all people, everywhere. Its objective it would seem is nothing more than to keep us in a place of perpetual fear.
