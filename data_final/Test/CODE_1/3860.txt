People magazine last week published a first-person account by a former reporter, Natasha Stoynoff, alleging that Donald Trump had sexually assaulted her in 2005 as she covered the first anniversary of his marriage to Melania Trump at his Florida resort Mar-a-Lago. As Trump showed her around the magnificent compound, he allegedly forced himself upon her — only to be interrupted by his butler. Though Stoynoff’s account carried a denial from a Trump spokeswoman, it contained little of the corroborating material that readers have come to expect from accounts of long-ago events of this sort.

Into this breach jumped Trump himself, who blasted People for its exposé. He made a logical argument, noting that People had published a positive happy-anniversary story about the couple that didn’t include the alleged assault. “Why wasn’t it part of the story that appeared 12 years ago?” Trump asked at a rally in West Palm Beach. He also said that “eyewitnesses” had challenged the story and that the setting for the alleged attack was a “public area, people all over the place.”

A follow-up story in People rebuts one question about the story: There are now six people who have come forward to corroborate aspects of Stoynoff’s story. One of them backs up the author’s contention that she’d run into Melania Trump after she left the Trump beat — an encounter that Melania Trump has denied. “They chatted in a friendly way,” recalls Liza Herz.

The whole sequence is unorthodox: Drop a first-person story with scarce reportorial backup one day, only to buttress it with more reporting on a later day. As this blog wrote last week, Stoynoff’s story sounded credible then, though initially including the details that People just published would have made for a more powerful presentation.

Now to the other consideration: Why, as Trump put it, would People have run the happy-anniversary piece after this alleged sexual assault took place? In a reflection written for The Post, then-People magazine Deputy Editor Larry Hackett suggested that killing the piece wasn’t discussed because the circumstances weren’t known: “No wonder Stoynoff didn’t feel able to confide in me or her other editors in 2005. The ghastly truth is that had Trump punched her, our course of action would have been much clearer. Instead, he exploited power, privilege and media sclerosis to his own sweaty ends.”

The follow-up story from People, however, notes that Stoynoff did indeed tell colleagues at the magazine about the incident:

PEOPLE East Coast Editor Liz McNeil was one colleague Stoynoff confided in about the incident. McNeil remembers the day she returned from the assignment in Florida to cover Trump and his wife’s first anniversary. “She was very upset and told me how he shoved her against a wall,” says McNeil. She adds, “The thing I remember most was how scared she was. I felt I had to protect her.”

The story doesn’t specify McNeil’s title back in 2005, though a People rep told Politico that she was a reporter a decade ago (as was another confidant who has become an editor). In her original piece, Stoynoff notes that she told a colleague about the alleged attack:

Back in my Manhattan office the next day, I went to a colleague and told her everything. “We need to go to the managing editor,” she said, “And we should kill this story, it’s a lie. Tell me what you want to do.” But, like many women, I was ashamed and blamed myself for his transgression. I minimized it (“It’s not like he raped me…”); I doubted my recollection and my reaction. I was afraid that a famous, powerful, wealthy man could and would discredit and destroy me, especially if I got his coveted PEOPLE feature killed. “I just want to forget it ever happened,” I insisted.

The attack that Stoynoff alleges is sickening. So, too, was the aftermath — instead of facing consequences for his alleged actions, Trump scored a positive splash in People magazine. After the story hit newsstands, Trump left a voice mail for Stoynoff, “I think you’re terrific. The article was great and you’re great.” Stoynoff interpreted the message to mean that Trump was pleased she’d kept her mouth shut.

Killing the story may have raised questions that Stoynoff didn’t want stirred at the time. Yet the countervailing consideration is also compelling: People magazine published a “flowery” depiction of a happy marriage that magazine staffers knew to be false. Journalists rarely encounter an ethical problem this vexing.

In his look-back piece, Hackett maintains that the anniversary story could have gone away without causing tremors:

I would probably have simply killed the story that Stoynoff had gone to Palm Beach to report. I would have then called Trump’s public relations operatives, told them about their boss’s bad behavior and agreed to a truce of mutual silence. In the end, few people would have learned of the event, we’d have had to fill a few more pages in the next issue, and Trump would have avoided any public embarrassment.

It’s the bolding (courtesy of the Erik Wemple Blog) that adds a further bout or two of nausea to this spectacle — that the imperative of a glossy magazine is to maintain access to rich celebrities. In a chat with the Erik Wemple Blog, Hackett contests that interpretation, saying, “I’m not saying that that wouldn’t have been net result but that wouldn’t have been the impetus behind it.” The impetus, rather, would have been to protect Stoynoff. Losing access to the mogul “would not have been that big a worry at the time, to be quite honest,” says Hackett.

The good news is that the People published its retraction more than a decade later, and just in time.
