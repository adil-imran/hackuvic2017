Mortar rounds hit the vicinity of Somalia’s presidential palace in the capital, Mogadishu, killing at least one person in an attack claimed by al-Qaeda-linked militants.

Six mortars were fired at Villa Somalia in the south of the city on Monday. There was one fatality and six other people were injured when shells struck their homes, Shire Salad, a local police officer, said by phone.

Al-Shabaab, the Islamist group that’s been fighting the Somali government for the past decade, claimed responsibility in an announcement on Radio Andalus, a broadcaster that backs their insurgency. While the militants have lost territory since being driven out of Mogadishu in 2011 by government and African Union forces, they continue to stage deadly gun and bomb attacks.

At least 25 people died when suspected al-Shabaab militants attacked a beach-front restaurant and hotel in the city last month.
