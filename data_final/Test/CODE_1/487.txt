WASHINGTON - Republican presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump has suggested that the United States should take a page from Israel’s book and encourage law enforcement to keep a closer eye on Muslims.



“I think profiling is something that we’re going to have to start thinking about as a country,” Trump said on CBS News programme 'Face the Nation' on Sunday, while discussing how the Orlando killings might have been prevented.



“You look at Israel and you look at others, and they do it and they do it successfully," he said.



The outspoken Republican has previously advocated barring Muslims from coming into the US and, in the wake of the mass shooting in Orlando carried out by gunman Omar Mateen, who had pledged allegiance to Islamic State, he now thinks profiling is a “common sense” tactic.



"And you know, I hate the concept of profiling, but we have to start using common sense,” Tump said.



In this regard, the billionaire businessman advocated checking on mosques “respectfully” as a way of tackling radical Islam.



When asked what kind of policy could have prevented Mateen’s rampage, Trump suggested “looking seriously” at profiling, noting that the perpetrator of the worst mass killing in US history was a New York born Muslim.



Following last Sunday’s attack, Trump returned to his December comments that called for a “complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” surmising that now “many are saying I was right to do so.

”

Civil rights activists, Muslims, African-Americans, Latinos and others condemned Trump’s statement, saying that profiling is unconstitutional.



The Council on American–Islamic Relations (CAIR) has condemned the Orlando nightclub shooting that left dozens of people dead last week, and called for unity among all Americans and warned politicians against exploiting the tragedy to score points.



Profiling is an oft-criticised law enforcement tactic.

The US National Institute of Justice -- the research and development of the Justice Department -- defined racial profiling as a "practice that targets people for suspicion of crime based on their race, ethnicity, religion or national origin.

"

Omar Mateen, armed with assault weapons, stormed the Pulse Club on June 12, killing 49 people and injured 53 others at the gay club, marking the worst ever mass shooting in US history.
