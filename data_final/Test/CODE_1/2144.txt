SUDAN

Military accused of Darfur chemical attacks

Amnesty International accused Sudan’s military on Thursday of using chemical weapons against civilians, including young children, in one of the most remote corners of the Darfur region over the past eight months.

The Britain-based human rights group said it had gathered “horrific evidence,” including satellite imagery, more than 200 in-depth interviews with survivors, and expert analysis of dozens of images, in an investigation that suggests at least 30 chemical attacks occurred in the Jebel Marra area.

Amnesty estimates the attacks may have killed 200 to 250 people.

Darfur has been witness to bloodshed since 2003, when rebels took up arms against the government in Khartoum, accusing it of discrimination and neglect. The United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have died in the conflict.

AFGHANISTAN

U.N. officials criticize fatal U.S. airstrike

United Nations officials on Thursday condemned an airstrike by an unmanned U.S. military aircraft a day earlier that they said killed 15 civilians and wounded at least 12 in the insurgent-plagued eastern Afghan province of Nangahar. They called for a thorough investigation.

The early morning attack targeted a residential compound in the volatile Achin district, near the border of Pakistan, which U.S. military officials said they believed was being used by fighters of the Islamic State militant group, widely known in Afghanistan as Daesh.

However, local leaders and legislators said all the victims were civilians.

Afghan police said the strike targeted Islamic State loyalists.

Officials of the U.N. Assistance Mission to Afghanistan called Thursday for a “prompt, independent, impartial” and effective investigation.

U.S. military officials confirmed Wednesday that they had conducted a “counterterrorism airstrike” in the area.

In a statement, they said they take “all allegations of civilian casualties very seriously” but added that Islamist State fighters “continue to put innocent lives at risk by deliberately surrounding themselves with civilians and dressing in female attire.”

The officials said they would work with Afghan officials to determine whether there was “need for further investigation.”

TURKEY

Erdogan: Emergency may be extended

Turkey’s president hinted Thursday that the three-month state of emergency declared after the July 15 coup attempt could be extended to more than a year.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, addressing local administrators in Ankara, dismissed criticism over plans for Turkey to prolong the state of emergency, saying no one should determine a “calendar or road map” for the country.

“Wait, be patient. Even 12 months might not be enough,” Erdogan said.

His comments came a day after the top national security body recommended that the state of emergency — instituted July 20 — be extended for three months.

The body, chaired by Erdogan, said an extension is needed “to take measures to protect the rights and freedoms of citizens.”

Erdogan said Thursday that “the matter is so deep and complicated it looks like three months will not be enough.”

The government accuses U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen of masterminding the coup attempt. The state of emergency has allowed the government to pass legislation through decrees, facilitating a massive crackdown on his movement.

PHILIPPINES

Duterte says he’ll scrap war games with U.S.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said joint military drills between the Philippines and the United States next week will be the last such exercises, although his foreign secretary quickly said the decision was not final.

Duterte made the comments in Hanoi this week, noting that the Philippines will maintain its military alliance with the United States because of a 65-year-old mutual defense treaty.

Duterte said that he wants to establish new trade and commercial alliances with China and Russia and that Beijing doesn’t want the war games.

“I would serve notice to you now that this will be the last military exercise,” he said. “Jointly, Philippines-U.S., the last one.”

Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Perfecto Yasay Jr., however, contradicted Duterte, saying joint military drills approved by the previous administration will continue until 2017, when officials can evaluate whether there is a need for them to go on.
