THE Chief Security Officer (CSO) of the convoy of Ondo state governor Olusegun Mimiko of Ondo State, Idowu Oyewole was, yesterday, murdered by suspected armed robbers.

The late Idowu was a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) attached to the convoy of the governor.

Vanguard gathered that some dare-devil armed robbers invaded the Sango Community, along Akure/Ado Ekiti road, Akure where he was reportedly gunned down on Wednesday night.

He was said to be having his dinner after returning from work when one of his neighbours informed him that a three-man armed robbery gang were in the vicinity.

Narrating the ugly incident leading to his death, his son, Dare told newsmen that “a neighbour’s son came to our house around 7.30 pm when my father was eating and told him that armed robbers had entered their house.”

According to Dare, his father took his service pistol and followed the neighbour’s son to their house in order to dislodge the suspected hoodlums.

But while on his way to dislodge the hoodlums, he was reportedly shot by one of the robbers, who noticed he had a gun on him.

He reportedly shot the armed robber and ran back to inform other neighbours to stay indoors.

An eyewitness told Vanguard that the police officer after sustaining injuries, as a result of the gun shot, reportedly died while rushing to a nearby hospital.

The source said that after the hoodlums escaped after one of them was shot, they couldn’t quickly locate where the police officer was until the following day.

The eyewitness said: “His corpse was seen the following day in the neighborhood by one of those residing in the street. It was likely that he was rushing to the nearby hospital and must have fallen on the ground before he could get there as a result of the gun shot.”

Vanguard also gathered that the hoodlums before shooting the Police officer had abducted a four year old boy in one of the houses.

A source in the neighbourhood also said after attacking the Police officer, the hoodlums held his four –year old boy hostage and told his wife to open the door otherwise he would be shot.

The police officer reportedly refused to open the door and the hoodlums matcheted the boy leaving him in that pool of his blood before they fled.

The murder of the the Police officer has thrown the Akure metropolis in fear as the state police command yesterday beefed up security.

Police confirms death

Contacted, spokesman of the State Police Command, Femi Joseph confirmed the killing of the officer adding that he was attached to the Mobile Unit of the Force.

Joseph said that: “We have commenced investigation on the incident.”

While describing late Oyewole as disciplined and hard working officer, the Police image maker said that “we deserve your condolences. He was a disciplined officer. Our hearts are heavy.”
