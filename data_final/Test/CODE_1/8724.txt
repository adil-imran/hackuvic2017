Canadians’ warm reception of Syrian refugees has become a feel-good story for the nation. When Donald Trump declared that he would ban all Muslim immigration to the United States, many juxtaposed his vitriol against the large numbers of Syrian refugees being taken in by Canada. Images of Canadians welcoming Syrians into their homes and communities have been contrasted positively with the protests and violence of groups like Pegida, the anti-Islam and anti-immigrant movement spreading across Europe. (Pegida is the German acronym for Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West.)

But we miss seeing some important things, blinded by the glare of our own sunny ways.

An online Care2 petition asking the government to “stop resettling 25,000 Syrian refugees in Canada” has garnered almost 50,000 signatures, accompanied by comments such as “terrists [sic]” and “If the Liberal Government wishes to increase the number of refugee's [sic] to Canada, BRING IN THE CHRISTIANS. I don't think Mr. Trudeau will as he seems to be dedicated to the Muslim Brotherhood.” Calgary schools have been defaced by anti-Muslim graffiti, most recently two weeks ago. In January, a group of Syrian refugees attending a welcome event in Vancouver were attacked with pepper spray. Anti-immigrant groups have organized demonstrations in Canada; Pegida Quebec’s march in Montreal on Feb. 6 was shut down by activists.

And right-wing European demagogues have been invited to Canada to share their fear-mongering. On March 10, the Jewish Defense League (JDL) — identified as a “violent extremist organization” by the FBI — is hosting British politician Paul Weston in Toronto for an event claiming to reveal “the threat of radical Islamic immigration and the erosion of our freedoms.”

Weston is currently the leader of Pegida UK, launched earlier this year by former English Defense League leader Tommy Robinson. In the UK, Weston is perhaps best known for a viral video rant in which he proudly labelled himself a “racist,” and declared that Islam is a “thoroughly savage religious and political ideology.” “Islam is Nazism incarnate,” Weston announced at a recent Pegida UK rally in Birmingham, to an audience of protestors waving signs proclaiming “Trump is Right.” Never mind that in the current climate of anti-Muslim suspicion in Britain, it is the Muslim population that is increasingly under attack: London police reported that there were 816 assaults on Muslims in the city between July 2014 and July 2015 — a 70-per-cent spike from the year before.
