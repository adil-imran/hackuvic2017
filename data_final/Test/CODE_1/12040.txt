CHILLING: Enugu massacre survivors narrate their ordeal, say women, girls raped

Enugu – Following massacre by Fulani herdsmen that killed over 20 people in the Nimbo community in Uzo-Uwani Local Government Area of Enugu, some of the "disabled" survivors have narrated their ordeal.

According to Vanguard, residents of the community, who fled their homes and were now taking refuge at petrol stations, churches , motor parks, hospitals, army barracks and uncompleted buildings, spoke out about the gruesome attacks.

“…The number of death was too much for one community to bear. Our children were forced out of school for a good number of days now; we don’t know when it will be safe for us to go back to ours farms…,” one of the disabled persons identified as John Ayogu of Nimbo was reported as saying.

He said the herdsmen made it difficult for the community to settle in their farms, as they raped women and young girls.

Another resident, identified as Utazi Chikodili of Nimbo spoke as tears ran down from her eyes: "Fulani herdsmen have finished our people, turned indigenes of Nimbo to beggers. We wander about everyday looking for food and water to stay alive with the little ones who could do nothing but to cry when they are hungry.”

According to The Sun, one of the victims of the attack is Kingsley Ezugwu, a former Councillor, Nimbo Ward 2, remained grateful that he was not felled by the herds¬men’s bullets.

Ezugwu spoke from his hospital bed in Nsukka, Ezugwu: “I was coming out from the house when I heard the community bell ringing. I was going with a friend to know what the bell was all about, only to see about 40 Fulani herdsmen armed with sophisticated guns and machetes.

“They pursued us, killed my friend and shot at me several times but missed. They caught up with me and used machetes on me until I lost con¬sciousness.”

Reports indicated that over 100 armed cattle rearers stormed the community, killing indiscriminately and razing buildings in the process.

Prior to the attack, the herdsmen had been recruiting gunmen from Nasarawa in preparation for the deadly ambush.

Many of the villagers escaped to the nearby Uzo-Uwani area, where many of the natives in the community are fearing for their safety in light of more attacks.

The villagers said they were abandoned even after they alerted security agencies to the plan to attack them.
