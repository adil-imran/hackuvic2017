Dalit Camera – Through Un-Touchable Eyes organized a protest gathering at Tårnplassen, Bergen Norway in solidarity with the people of Kashmir currently at forefront of civil uprising that so far left 87 civilian dead and over 13000 injured.

The gathering held on September 10 was addressed by representatives from the Red Party (Rødt), Kurdistan Students Union, Kurdistan Culture Forum (Hordaland), Tamil Youth Organization (Norway), India Solidaritet, Tjenfolket, Aktivisten, Ny SOS Rasisme, United Nations Association (Vest), United Nations Students Association (Hordaland). The Green Party (Miljø De Grønne) could not take part in the event, but expressed their support offline.

The participants took a protest train from Tårnplassen to Litteraturhuset, via the Blue Stone (den Blåsteinen) and Torgallmeningen, carrying various placards demanding freedom for Kashmir, end of military occupation and right to self-determination for the people of Kashmir.

At Litteraturhuset, event anchor Hamsi Premkumar welcomed all participants and presented the outline of the program. Archana Bidargaddi briefly introduced Dalit Camera: Through Un-Touchable Eyes and how relevant, important and significant it is for Dalit Camera – “which itself aims to capture and present the brutal nature of the brahminical hindu nation state” – to stand in solidarity with the people of Kashmir.

Dr Dibyesh Anand set the context for the evening with an introduction to the current situation of Kashmir, and the history of Kashmiri struggle for freedom and self-determination. MC Kash’s 30-min hip-hop concert that followed was “strong, sublime” and “touched” many a chord with attendees from diverse backgrounds. The concert was followed by a conversation between Dr Dibyesh and MC Kash which offered perspectives of both a Kashmiri and an Indian who empathises with the freedom struggle. The conversation also paved way for interaction between delegates and audience, which included questions and concerns related to, among other things, future of the struggle, means and methods, possibilities, suggestions and options.

“Tamils – who are still waiting for justice for all those massacred in 2009 by the Sri Lankan state, during their struggle for self-determination and rights – could immediately connect with the Kashmir plight. They expressed their concern at the grave situation in Kashmir today, were interested in knowing how the struggle will develop towards the goal of freedom and expressed concerns over relying solely on UN’s role in the path towards fetching justice,” a statement released by Dr Dibyesh said.

“The conversation/interaction was followed by short speeches by the supporting organizations that were present. UN-Association and UN-Students Association, represented by Synne Aarskaug and Ane Korsnes, expressed their emphasis on Human Rights to be upheld. They also stressed on the importance of the event as an awareness building exercise, and how it helps the world get a glimpse of what is happening in the Kashmir Valley.”

Torbjørn Monsen, representing the Rødt party, in very clear terms stated that it is important for the Norwegian Left party – for that matter any true Left party – to stand in solidarity with the oppressed anywhere in the world. He reminded how the tools used by the Indian state are but too familiar – “strong censorship, restriction on freedom of speech and assembly, draconian laws designed to hold people in their place and arbitrary use of force by the government. Opening fire on peaceful demonstrators can never be justified. When our comrades in Kashmir invites us to join their struggle, that is also our chance to gain partners in our own cause”. He stated that “our [Red Party’s] stance is strongly and squarely on the side of Kashmiri Independence. Solidarity forever and Freedom to the Kashmiri people”.

Roger Solsvik representing India Solidaritet, Tjenfolket (Serve the People) and Aktivisten, said, “Today the government in India shows their desperation in Kashmir. Through widespread use of brutal violence against civilians they show that they fear the people, fear the power that lies in the masses, fear the peoples organisation and resistance”. He added that Indiasolidaritet, Serve the People and Aktivisten extend “the greatest solidarity with the Kashmiri people, liberation advocates and activists”. He added that the “principle of Self-determination is one of the most important principles to make sure that the nations of the world can live in peace, and violation of this law is an attack on world peace. Stop atrocities against the Kashmiri people! Free Kashmir!”. Roger then finished his talk by singing the Swedish anti-imperialist song Telegram från en bombad by (“Telegram from a Bombed Village”) by Cornelis Vreeswijk, made in protest against the bombing of Hanoi.

“MCKash and Dr Dibyesh brought the event to a close by mentioning what we all could do in terms of solidarity – namely talk about Kashmir, use the hashtags #FreeKashmir #Azadi #DemilitarizeKashmir, bring awareness related to the Kashmir situation to political party discussion rooms and National debates, and to formulate steps to put pressure on India towards self-determination of Kashmiris,” the statement said. “It was a powerful evening with strong messages, new friendships and new connections beyond borders – united in suffering but also in mutual strength and solidarity.”

“The Red Party supports people and nations that fight against occupation and oppression, and we recognise the right to self-determination for nations. We support the Kashmiri people in their struggle for independence and freedom of speech and against all forms of oppression. And demand that India must end the military occupation and violence against Kashmir.”

International solidarity is a central part of socialism, and a socialist Norway needs to tie bonds with, and support, modern people’s movements in other countries, the statement said. “The foreign policy within socialism is based upon respect, reciprocity and equal rights. It is important that we cooperate with parties, forums and organizations working for a socialist society in other countries. A socialist government must support other people and nations that struggle to break with imperialism and that try to build socialist societies based on their own preconditions.

“MDG upholds that Human Rights are respected and are very concerned innocent should not be affected in the conflict in Kashmir, on both sides. We want a peaceful resolution and believe this should be done through diplomatic means, and not through warfare. We express solidarity with those affected by Human Rights violations in Kashmir, and with organizations working for peace, reconciliation and Human Rights in Kashmir.”

The statement quoting Kurdisk Student Union said, “Today, we are here to show our support to the Kashmiri people. Unfortunately it so happens that there is still much injustice in the world, there are still many countries that do not get attention, including Kashimiri people, Kurds, Tamils and many other nations. We are against the occupation against Kashmir, we are against military forces attacking peaceful demonstrations, we are against the killing of civilians and activists, we are strongly opposed curfew because it affects only civilians.”

Indiasolidaritet while supporting the right to national self-determination said, “the people of Kashmir have a fundamental right to decide the future for themselves and their nation. The Indian state continues to control Kashmir through military repression. They have deployed hundreds of thousands of armed soldiers in the area to suppress and deny the people of Kashmir their rights. They stand behind grotesque abuses, numerous disappearances, killings and human rights violations. We condemn the abuse and violence the Indian state use against the Kashmiri freedom fighters and the Kashmiri independence movement. We condemn the Indian government’s attempt to gag this movement and all those who support a free Kashmir.”

“We want to express the greatest solidarity with the Kashmiri people, liberation advocates and activists. We will support you by sharing information in Norway about the oppression of Indian government, and by lifting the principle of self-determination high. This principle is one of the most important principles to make sure that the nations of the world can live in peace, and violation of this law is an attack on world peace. Stop atrocities against the Kashmiri people! Free Kashmir!”

Aktivisten Bergen supports the people of Kashmir in their struggle for liberation, the statement said. “Today the government in India shows their desperation in Kashmir. Through widespread use of brutal violence against civilians they show that they fear the people, fear the power that lies in the masses, fear the peoples organisation and resistance.”
