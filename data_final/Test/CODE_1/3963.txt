A Travis County jury returned a not guilty verdict in Bryan Juarezs murder trial.

After resuming discussions on Monday morning, the jury deliberated for 10 ½ hours over two days.

Juarez, 23, was on trial for shooting Christopher Burton at an East Austin apartment complex on the evening of Aug. 3, 2015. The altercation was sparked by Burton calling Juarez a gay slur.

In Fridays closing arguments, prosecutors said Juarez was fueled by anger and alcohol when he grabbed a gun from his apartment and confronted Burton about the slur.

So, if after I have a few beers with my neighbor, he calls me a "fag," then ok for me to go get my gun and shoot him? Or . . . this guy has been harassing me for a very long time . . . I'm drunk and I've had enough . . . Or . . . just don't mess with a drunk Texan who owns a gun?

There must be more to it than that.

Yes. From a slightly more detailed article last week: “The victim, Chris Burton, was a member of the Bloods street gang who police say once threatened to stab a Walmart female employee who confronted him about stealing.” http://www.statesman.com/news/news/crime-law/witness-bryan-juarez-was-drunk-when-he-shot-christ/nskSk/
