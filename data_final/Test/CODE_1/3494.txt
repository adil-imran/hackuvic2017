Durban - Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande is concerned about academic time lost to student unrest, as protests in parts of the country continued for fee-free education.

This was as protests continued at Wits University in Johannesburg, while the DUT on Tuesday announced protests had ended after students agreed to return to class after a mass meeting on Tuesday.

Nzimande told a hall packed with parents and pupils at a book launch in Pietermaritzburg that a third force was involved in the student protests.

He was at the launch of the Mzala Nxumalo Centre’s book, Strive for Excellence: A Social and Political History of Georgetown High School.

Nzimande said government’s decision to impose a freeze on fee increases for the poor and missing middle showed commitment from it.

He spoke of the 1.6 million beneficiaries of the NSFAS (National Student Financial Aid Scheme), and said more than R14 billion was being spent this year on 205 000 university and 200 000 TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training) students.

Speaking on the sidelines at Georgetown High School, he said: “I am concerned about the way the academic year is being threatened by all these developments.

“Not to finish the academic year would be a disaster for our country. But it is very clear now that there is a political agenda generally, to try and use universities as a base to try and discredit the ANC government,” he said.

Asked how this was clear, Nzimande shot back: “The evidence is all over, it is on television, you can see it, it’s there, people are burning, people are stopping others from going to class, and it is a small minority that is actually doing this.

“Why would it not be obvious to you, as the media, that there must be an agenda? Who has an interest in not finishing the academic year?” he said.

Nzimande also called on the University of Zululand’s management and staff to find a solution.

This week, the union Nehawu was issued with a “lock out” order, which barred union members from protesting or entering the university. The university has enforced the no work, no pay principle as the labour dispute this week entered its eighth week.

Last week, angry students demanding to return to class assaulted the SRC president and left a security officer bruised on the KwaDlangezwa campus in Empangeni.

“I wish they could resolve whatever the problem is there, because what I understand is that it is mostly a worker-related issue,” said Nzimande.

“We are asking for management and the workers to resolve the problems that exist there because putting the futures of students in jeopardy… is not what we need, and will not take us forward. I am really urging them to urgently find a solution,” he said.

Nzimande said he was in contact with the UniZulu council chairman, Mr CV Gamede, and said he was concerned about the nature in which the situation was “deteriorating” at the university.

“They should find one another and give themselves time to find a solution. If they are failing to do that on their own, then there must be mediation,” he said.

Nzi­mande, who completed his ­matric in 1975 at Georgetown High, told pupils he was one of 38 pupils in the matric class, and all passed that year.

“Our country has problems and challenges, we do not deny that, but you Georgetown students of today, we expect a lot out of you, this is your country,” he said.

DUT’s acting deputy vice-chancellor for operations, Professor Theo Andrew, said the academic programme would resume today at all DUT campuses after they reached an agreement with the SRC.
