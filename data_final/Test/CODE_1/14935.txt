NEW DELHI, Feb. 10 (Xinhua) -- A Pakistani-American 's testimony in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks case before a special Indian court via video link from the U.S. was cancelled Wednesday, following a technical glitch.

David Coleman Headley, who is currently serving a prison term of 35 years in the United States for conspiring with the banned Pakistani terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba and Pakistani spies in plotting the Mumbai massacre, has been depositing before the special court in Mumbai since Monday.

However, the video link could not be established for over three hours this morning, following which the testimony from an undisclosed location in the U.S. had to be called off and has been slated for Thursday.

"There were technical problems from America. There was no visual link, only an audio link. We tried again and again but every effort failed. Our lines were working but American experts failed,"

Ujjwal Nikam, special Indian public prosecutor, told the media.

"The U.S. Department of Justice informed us that they regretted that the hearing can take place only Thursday."
