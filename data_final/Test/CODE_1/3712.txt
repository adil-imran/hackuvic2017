Salma Hayek has shared a story about meeting Donald Trump before she became a household name, and if true, it’s a pretty telling insight into how petty he really is.

Via BuzzFeed, when asked if she believed the women who had accused Trump of sexual assault during an interview with LA radio show El Show del Mandril, Salma said that she did, before recalling her own encounter with the presidential hopeful:

When I met that man, I had a boyfriend, and he tried to become his friend to get my home telephone number. He got my number and he would call me to invite me out.

When I told him I wouldn’t go out with him even if I didn’t have a boyfriend, he called — well, he wouldn’t say he called, but someone told the National Enquirer.

She alleges that soon after she refused to go out with him, a suspiciously timed story appeared in US tabloid the National Enquirer about the situation, but claiming that it was Trump who rejected her, not the other way around.

Someone told the National Enquirer — I’m not going to say who, because you know that whatever he wants to come out comes out in the National Enquirer. It said that he wouldn’t go out with me because I was too short.

Later, he called and left me a message. ‘Can you believe this? Who would say this? I don’t want people to think this about you.’ He thought that I would try to go out with him so people wouldn’t think that’s why he wouldn’t go out with me.

The 11th woman to accuse Trump of sexual misconduct came forward on Friday. A lawyer representing his other accusers says that she will share her story over the weekend.

The First Lady Michelle Obama also addressed the allegations in her powerful campaign speech for Hilary Clinton last week:

Last week, we saw this candidate actually bragging about sexually assaulting women. And I can’t believe that I’m saying that a candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women. And I have to tell you that I can’t stop thinking about this. It has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn’t have predicted.

I’d love nothing more than to pretend that this isn’t happening and to come out and give my normal campaign speech," she said. "But this was not just a lewd conversation. This wasn’t just locker room banter. This was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behaviour and actually bragging about kissing and groping women.

And to make matters worse, it now seems very clear that this isn’t an isolated incident. It's one of countless examples of how he has treated women his whole life.
