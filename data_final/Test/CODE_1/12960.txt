The alleged massacre of Shi’ites by the Nigerian Army also known as the Zaria Massacre which occurred between December 12 and 14, 2015 has marked another bloody chapter in the violent history of Nigeria’s nationhood. While the scale of the killing is shocking, it is not surprising that the army with its long history of human rights violations is again at the centre of this vicious cycle of arbitrary execution.

According to revelations from the public hearing of the Kaduna State Judicial Commission of Inquiry on the Army-Shi’ites clash, 327 people were allegedly killed by soldiers during the clash and later buried in a mass grave by the state government. The army had said it had responded to the Shi’ite followers’ attempt to assassinate the Chief of Army Staff, Gen. Tukur Buratai. But this claim has been strongly rejected by the Islamic Movement and several human rights organisations who argue that the attack was pre-planned.

In its investigative report entitled, “Unearthing the truth: Unlawful killings and mass cover-up in Zaria”, Amnesty International, a human rights group, has revealed that “more than 350 people are believed to have been unlawfully killed by the military between December 12 and 14, following a confrontation between members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria and soldiers in Zaria, Kaduna State.” The army has denied the claims as exaggerated. As the blame game continues, one fact has become self-evident: The army was high-handed in a situation they could have defused with minimum force. But this is not uncommon. Our security forces are known for extreme use of force even in the mildest of conflicts.

One just hopes that the outrage generated by the latest massacre will help put an end to the excessive use of force by the security forces. When I saw the video of the confrontation released by the army, I knew it was a Cache 22 situation. Buratai was seen in the video pleading to no avail for a right of way with the unyielding Shi’ites. The situation soon spiralled into chaos and bloodshed.

Though what happened thereafter is now the subject of controversy, the scale of the massacre is consistent with the temperament of our army over the years. The massacre has once again shown how brutal our security forces can be in deploying maximum force. I have heard some Nigerians justify the killings based on primordial sentiments. But the truth is that it can happen anywhere.

Those who know what our security forces are capable of are wise enough to avoid any confrontation with them. It will always be fatal. The saying that one should not argue with a man with a gun rings true of our law enforcement agents. With a series of deadly massacres of civilian population in the past, our security agencies are said to be one of the greatest violators of human rights in the world. If the findings are later proved to be correct, what on earth would justify the killing of 327 people?

This impunity is nothing new. The relationship between the security forces and “bloody civilians” has always left a trail of sorrow, tears and blood as the late Afrobeat legend, Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, once sang. Nigerians avoid the security forces like the plague. Ironically, the weapons used in extrajudicial killings are bought with the taxpayers’ money.

The spokesperson for the Nigerian Army, Col. Sani Usman, had accused Amnesty International of bias. He had said in a statement: “A judicial commission of inquiry is in place in addition to (an) investigation by the National Human Rights Commission. They (Amnesty) must allow the judicial commission of inquiry and all other relevant agencies (to) complete and submit their reports before jumping to conclusions. We believe the report is hasty, partial and lacks credibility and objectivity.”

While the army did not deny it was involved in the massacre, it was curious that it is condemning Amnesty for releasing its report. The question is: Why must Amnesty, an independent body, delay to release its report when it has completed investigation? How long does it take to investigate such killings? Should they wait until evidence has been destroyed? In any case, the Kaduna State Government has confirmed the number of deaths. What the army seems to disagree with is the number of casualties and not culpability.

But again the question is: How much casualty is too small or too high when dealing with human lives? I believe one human life is as important as 372 lives. Nigerians should really be worried that the military institution has still not reformed itself. Given its chequered past, operating under a democracy should have caused some fundamental changes in military operations. While I think it was unwise for the Shi’ites or any group to confront the symbol of military power, the military could have deployed a non-lethal approach to neutralise the group.

I want to also make it clear that the Shi’ites went beyond their civic rights. Confronting soldiers on national duty is condemnable. But 327 lives is just too high a price to be paid. One is not even sure about number of collateral damage. Were there other non-Shiites victims – I am talking about innocent Nigerians who may have been caught in the mayhem?

The Zaria massacre is one assault too many. Our security forces must learn to engage without the use of extreme force. The impunity cuts across the armed forces. For example, in police stations, officers are alleged to subject suspects to torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment when extracting evidence.

The Zaria massacre is unmatched in our contemporary political history. It happened in Odi, Bayelsa State in 1999 when the entire village was shut up and burnt to the ground by the military. The military had defended its action at the time saying it was ambushed on its way to Odi. It happened two years later in Zaki Biam in Benue State during the crisis between the Tiv ethnic group and the Junkun. Militias of Tiv origin had allegedly abducted and killed 19 soldiers. The reprisal by soldiers led to the sacking of Zaki Biam and neighbouring villages with hundreds of people which include children and women killed. Human Rights Watch condemned the invasion, “the security forces have a duty to protect, not to attack, the population. The murder of the 19 soldiers should certainly be condemned, but their deaths do not justify the slaughter of civilians by the Nigerian Army.” The army must respect human rights. Arbitrary executions, razing down entire villages in search of a few criminals cannot not be an acceptable way of dealing with conflicts. Extrajudicial killing like the one in Zaria is the reason why international partners are reluctant to cooperate with our military. Government must put an end to this needless vicious cycle of mass killings.
