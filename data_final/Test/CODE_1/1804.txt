ISLAMABAD: Advisor on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz has said that the supersonic interceptor missile recently developed and tested by India would disturb the balance of power in the South Asian region.

Talking to the Radio Pakistan, the adviser said that Pakistan was not oblivious to its defence and that it would also continue to upgrade its defensive capabilities. “Pakistan will definitely acquire advanced technology to improve its defence,” he said.

“India is enjoying the American cooperation as the US believes a strong India is vital to contain rival China,” he said. But he also said that Pakistan would also raise its voice at the world level against these activities that will shake up the regional balance.

On Sunday, India test fired its ‘indigenously developed’ supersonic interceptor missile from a test range off Odisha coast, the indian media reported.

On Sunday, India claimed that it test fired its ‘indigenously developed’ supersonic interceptor missile from a test range off Odisha coast. “The test conducted to validate various parameters of the interceptor in flight mode has been successful,” the Indian media quoted unidentified Indian officials as saying.

The interceptor was engaged against a target which was a naval version of Prithvi missile launched from a ship anchored inside Bay of Bengal, taking up the trajectory of a hostile ballistic missile. The target missile was launched at about 1115 hours and the interceptor roared through its trajectory to destroy the incoming hostile missile in mid-air in an end atmospheric altitude, it said.

“The ‘kill’ effect of the interceptor was ascertained by analysing data from multiple tracking sources,” a scientist quoted. The interceptor is a 7.5 metre long single stage solid rocket propelled guided missile equipped with a navigation system, a hi-tech computer and an electro-mechanical activator, the Indian officials said.

The interceptor missile had its own mobile launcher, secure data link for interception, independent tracking and homing capabilities and sophisticated radars, it said.
