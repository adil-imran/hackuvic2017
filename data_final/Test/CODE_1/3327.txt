Within hours of the breaking of news about the gang-rape of a 16-year-old by more than 30 men in a Rio de Janeiro favela last week, a Facebook page was created by a group of women to organise a protest against the crime. The main message on the page asked the Rio residents to protest as it was not "acceptable that we do not make noise".

With anger rising against the crime and slow police action against 33 men involved in the attack, the page urged people to take inspiration from India's Nirbhaya case.

"Who does not remember the 23-year-old girl's case of 2012 who was raped and murdered by six men in a bus in India? She died! And the next day, thousands of Indian women were on the streets, demanding the end of this culture of fear,"

said the page which has been "liked" by thousands and has a thread of several hundred messages, with many referring to the protests that had swept India following the crime in the national capital.

Organised mainly through this page, a massive protest took place in Rio on last Friday, with hundreds of women gathering on the steps of the city Legislative Assembly. Carrying placards which protested against violence against women and demanded action against the criminals involved in the case, some had painted their faces with the female symbol. Said Camila Araujo, a Rio-based activist, referring to the Nirbhaya case.

"We know about the case in India. We also want to protest in similar way so that our voices are heard and this rape culture is finished. The police are very slow. We want to tell them that this is not acceptable anymore, just like the people of Delhi did after the case".

The Rio case came to light after two suspects posted her photos and videos — naked, unconscious and suffering abuse — on the social networks last Wednesday.

Though it's almost a week since the teenager was assaulted by a group of men whose number, according to the police, could be as high as 36, the probe has been moving at a slow pace. Just four persons, including the girl's boyfriend, have been detained so far. Though the police have now pressed helicopters and special teams to hunt down the culprits, the anger against the police is growing in the city that will host the Olympics in August.

In the meantime, the outrage caused by the assault and Rio protests have set in motion a series of demonstrations that will rock the country this week. The biggest demonstration will take place here on Avenida Paulista on Tuesday (June 1), where thousands are expected to rally against the crime. Again organised through social networks, the Sao Paulo protest has "invited" more than 160,000 people through its Facebook page.

At the protest site, there is already a wall dedicated to slogans with photos of some of the most well-known anti-rape protests in the world. Called a "Mural in support of rape victims", a photo of Delhi women with candles in their hands at the India Gate after the Nirbhaya case sits among the cluster of posters under the slogan "#NoMoreRape". Hundreds of people have left hand-written messages on the mural.

The Sao Paulo protest is expected to gather at least 25,000 people. That will make it one of the biggest protests against sexual crimes in the history of this country. Similar rallies are being organised in other cities as the outrage caused by the attack on the teenager spreads across the country. says the Facebook page of the group which has organised these protests.

"This event aims to show that we do not accept impunity for rape and any form of harassment".

In the meantime, the 16-year-old who was the victim of a gang rape has deleted her Facebook profile after she was accused by some of not being assaulted at all. Earlier, the teenager had joined the campaign "I fight to end rape culture" by writing a post on her Facebook page. The girl wrote on her page.

"No, I do not want media attention. It was not me who posted the photos (of assault) on social media. So stop blaming me!"

What is fuelling anger here is the slow progress in the case and the police's attitude towards the victim. In an interview broadcast on Sunday evening on prime time television, the teenager criticised the chief investigator in the case for asking her if she was often involved in group sex. She said.

"It was horrible to testify because they blamed me for something I did not. They were wondering why I was there. The officer was trying to make me feel guilty. Then I stopped answering questions".

On Sunday, though the chief investigator was taken off the case and replaced by another officer the police have been frustratingly slow in moving against the criminals.

"I do not believe in justice," the girl said on TV on Sunday night. "I believe in the justice of God, which is slow, but does not fail."
