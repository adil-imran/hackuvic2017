The Kurdish national motto, “The Kurds Have No Friends,” may prove to be particularly apt in the course of the coming months, despite the crucially important role the Kurds of Syria and Iraq have played in the fight against the Islamic State. While it is widely recognized that the Kurds, particularly the YPG (People’s Protection Units), have been the most effective fighting forces on the ground, the territorial gains they have made have set off rumblings in both Ankara and Washington. The message is becoming too clear to ignore: If and when a settlement is reached at the Syria peace talks in Geneva, the Kurds are likely to be swiftly abandoned by their erstwhile US and Western allies.

The reasons for this are twofold: First, Washington exhibits an embarrassing fealty toward Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is waging a brutal war against the Kurds in southeast Turkey, all the while shelling Kurdish positions in northern Syria. Second, the Kurds have been repeatedly said to be assisting Russia’s campaign in Syria. In today’s political environment, particularly with the latest round of charges from NATO and Washington that Russia is “weaponizing” information and refugees, among other things, past evidence of collusion with Vladimir Putin’s Russia gives the Western coalition a ready-made excuse for eventually ceding to Erdogan’s demands to cut them off.

A White House readout of a call between Presidents Obama and Erdogan in mid-February noted, “President Obama stressed that YPG forces should not seek to exploit circumstances in this area to seize additional territory….” Obama is then said to have “emphasized the unwavering commitment of the United States to Turkey’s national security as a NATO Ally.” This, at the very same time Turkey’s prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, vowed to continue shelling YPG positions in northern Syria.

On February 27, Davutoglu gave a speech attacking the left-wing pro-Kurdish opposition, the HDP (People’s Democratic Party), accusing it of treason. “They are,” said Davutoglu, “collaborating with Russia like the Armenian gangs used to do.” In this context, the Turkish prime minister’s labeling of Kurds as “Armenians” who are “collaborating” with the Russians is a sinister ploy aimed at excusing the 1915 Armenian genocide while at the same time serving to brand Kurdish citizens as inherently disloyal “others.” But never mind all that, Ankara claims that Turkey is the victim. This despite the brutal war Ankara has been waging against the Kurds in Turkey’s southeast since October.
