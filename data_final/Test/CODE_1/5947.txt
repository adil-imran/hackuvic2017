14 more drug suspects slain

MANILA, Philippines - Fourteen more persons suspected of involvement in the illegal drug trade were killed in Luzon and Mindanao in the past two days.

Four were slain in Bulacan on Thursday, three of them by suspected vigilantes.

Senior Superintendent Romeo Caramat, Bulacan police acting director, identified the fatalities as Claro Vitalista, 50, a resident of Barangay Telapatio in San Ildefonso town; Marvin Najera, 36, of Barangay Tabang, Plaridel, and Angelito Gregorio, 42, of Barangay Tanod, Sta. Maria.

Leonardo Aquino of Barangay Taal, Bocaue was slain in a reported shootout with police during a drug sting.

Caramat said Vitalista was ranked eighth on the drug watchlist of the San Ildefonso police while the other fatalities were known drug pushers in their areas.

The fatalities reportedly yielded sachets of shabu, guns and drug paraphernalia.

Four men were killed in alleged encounters with police in Rizal also on Thursday.

Cris Samoy, who was on the drug watchlist of the Cainta police, and his two companions reportedly drew their guns after sensing they had sold shabu to an undercover agent in Barangay San Isidro in Cainta at around 9 p.m.

A caliber .45 pistol, two caliber .38 revolvers, nine sachets of shabu and P500 in cash were recovered from the fatalities, police said.

A man known only as Toto allegedly traded shots with police in a drug sting in Barangay Quisao in Pililla.

In La Union, Jerry Austria and his alleged cohort Benjamin Lucena were killed during an anti-drug operation in Barangay Pangao-aoan East in Aringay town while Pedro Padilla was gunned down in Barangay Leones East in Tubao yesterday.

Police said Austria and Padilla were ranked fifth on the drug watchlist of the Caba and Tubao police, respectively.

Police recovered a pistol and several sachets of shabu from the fatalities.

In Pangasinan, suspected vigilantes killed Edgar Lampa, 49, and Edwin Lopez, 46, on Thursday.

Lampa, who surrendered recently, was the most wanted drug personality in Binalonan town. Lopez was on Lingayen police’ drug watchlist.

In Batangas, an unidentified man was found dead near the road in Barangay Munting Tubig in Balayan at around 9:45 p.m. yesterday. His body bore a placard identifying him as a drug pusher and robber.

Chief Inspector Catherine Diego Ramos, Balayan police officer-in-charge, said probers are eyeing infighting among drug pushers as the motive for the killing.

Also on Thursday in Butuan City, businessman Renato Cabrera, 52, was killed during a raid on his residence in Barangay Lapu-Lapu.

The Butuan police said the raid was based on a search warrant issued by Misamis Oriental Regional Trial Court Branch 10 Executive Judge Judy Sia-Galvez.

Anti-drug operatives reportedly recovered 30 grams of shabu at the scene.

In Nueva Ecija, Senior Superintendent Manuel Cornel, provincial police director, said 20 barangay chairmen are on the drug watchlist of the police.

“We call on them to surrender as soon as possible so they could clear their name,” Cornel said.

He also called the attention of at least 155 village chiefs who are not cooperating in the implementation of Oplan Tokhang. – Ric Sapnu, Non Alquitran, Ed Amoroso, Victor Martin, Cesar Ramirez, Jun Elias, Ben Serrano, Manny Galvez
