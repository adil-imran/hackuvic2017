Activists burn Murray-Darling Basin documents at lively action group meeting in Broken Hill

Posted

There have been dramatic scenes at the first meeting of a water action group in far west New South Wales, which says it will push ahead with planned legal action after recruiting almost 300 members.

The newly-formed Broken Hill Darling River Action Group is hoping to launch a class action against state and federal authorities over the far west's water shortage.

Broken Hill's traditional water supply, the Menindee Lakes, is largely empty, with residents of the region blaming the State Government's management of the Darling River system and the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.

Action group secretary Darryn Clifton said he did not think the group would have any problems attracting the numbers needed to press ahead, with about $3,000 raised at the meeting on Thursday night.

"I've had people contact me via text message and through Facebook saying they want to join," Mr Clifton said.

"These are people outside of our communities, up north near Tamworth, down through the Murrumbidgee Valley and through South Australia that really want to help," he said.

"They know the Menindee Lakes is a key in the whole Murray-Darling Basin."

Group leaders set alight copies of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority's annual report after the meeting, outside the Broken Hill Musicians Club.

The organisation has previously only existed as a Facebook group, and the incorporated association was formed to give the legal action a better chance of succeeding.

Members are currently seeking advice from an experienced lawyer to find out whether they have a chance of mounting the legal action.

"Our main aim is to raise the funds to get the QC's advice, and then whatever that advice is, if we've got a case to move forward then we will sit down and discuss the future potential actions," Mr Clifton said.

"Broken Hill's a fighting community, the far west is a fighting community, people along the river are fighting communities.

"We will all join together, and we'll take this to the Government one way or another."

The State Government is preparing to invest as much as half a billion dollars in a project to secure a long-term water supply for the city.

Range of proposals discussed

A wide range of motions were put to the meeting, not all of which attracted support.

Water campaigner Marie Wecker said she was not sold on a proposal to pipe water from the Clarence River to the far west.

"I'm not a great believer in turning the Clarence around. I see the Clarence flowing out into the ocean as supporting a vibrant economy and it supports people up that way," she said.

"We're complaining because someone's taking our water. That does not give us the right to do that to someone else."

But Ms Wecker said she supported the overall effort, which mirrored a group she helped form in 2004.

"To see it turn around now, we're in a worse position than what we were in then," she said.

"There just needs to be a focus, and to make sure they stick with a focus and stay with it more than anything.

"We need to stand strong on this, otherwise I think the Government's going to walk over us."
