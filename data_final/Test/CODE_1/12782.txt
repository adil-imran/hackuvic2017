From Laois to Kerry is Dr Keane's latest work, exploring the transplantation of the Seven Septs - the Moores, Kellys, Dowlings, Lawlors, Dorans, Dee and McEvoys - from Laois to North Kerry in 1607, as well as the persistence of those surnames in Kerry life into the modern era.

We only love the Moores, Kellys, Dowlings, Lawlors, Dorans, Dees and McEvoys like our own these days (something they've earned having spent the best part of half a millennium here) but it wasn't always the case, as Dr Keane's book sets out in the greatest detail given this particular subject yet.

The names arrived to the region after the vanquishing of the Seven Septs at the Battle of Mullaghmast, the surviving members banished to Kerry on pain of death if they tried to return home. But the transplantation was only possible after what Dr Keane described as the 'ethnic cleansing' of the natives in the Elizabethan-Desmond war. They settled down as tenant farmers under landlord Patrick Crosbie, whose story also forms a large part of the new work. Dr Declan Downey will launch the work at Tarbert Community Centre at 7pm on Saturday, August 20.
