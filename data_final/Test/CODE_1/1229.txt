VIENTIANE – They were not seated next to each other as announced earlier by Malacañang, but President Duterte and United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon chatted and shook hands during the gala dinner for delegates to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit last Wednesday.

An online photo released by Malacañang yesterday showed Duterte talking to Ban, whose earlier voicing of concern over reports of extrajudicial killings in the Philippines got the goat of the foul-mouthed Duterte.

There was no information on what Duterte and Ban talked about during their brief encounter, but it was the UN official who approached the Philippine leader, according to the latter’s special assistant Christopher Go. He said the UN chief just greeted Duterte.

Chief presidential legal counsel Salvador Panelo said he also talked to Ban and assured him the Philippines has never violated international law. “I told him the information reaching him are wrong,” Panelo said.

He quoted Ban as saying in reply the information reaching the UN had shaped its perceptions of the Philippines.

“That perception is not the reality,” Duterte’s chief counsel said.

He also reported to have told Ban the drug syndicates and not the police perpetrated the killings.

Last March, Duterte, then a presidential candidate, labeled the UN “hypocritical” for asking developing countries like the Philippines to cut carbon emissions without imposing sanctions on industrialized nations that pollute the air.

Three months later, he scored the UN for supposedly failing to address the killings in Africa.

“P*t**g in* ka UN (you whore UN). You cannot even lift a finger in Africa. Do not force your code of conduct on me. You’re not supposed to do that,” Duterte said.

Duterte’s tiff with the UN worsened last June when he said that some of the slain journalists had received bribes or were involved in shady transactions.

The UN and media watchdogs condemned the statement, viewing it as an endorsement of killing of journalists.

UN Special Rapporteurs Cristof Heyns and David Kaye had accused Duterte of inciting violence and of sending signals that the murder of journalists is acceptable in some circumstances.

Ban also condemned the statement, noting that extrajudicial killing is illegal and a breach of fundamental rights and freedoms.

Last month, Duterte threatened to pull the Philippines out of the UN but backtracked a few days later, saying his statement was just a joke.

Duterte skipped the ASEAN-UN meet here last Wednesday but officials clarified he did not intend to avoid Ban but only decided to pay a courtesy call on Lao president Bounnhang Vorachith, the host of this year’s ASEAN meet.

Buzz fizzles out

On Wednesday, Presidential Communications Office Secretary Martin Andanar announced Duterte would be seated between Ban and US President Barack Obama at the gala dinner. The announcement created a buzz among journalists covering the event.

The Palace statement said media from all over the world “are up in excitement” as they awaited the event.

The statement also predicted that Duterte and Obama would “possibly say something positive” to each other after their bilateral meeting was canceled and supposedly moved to a later date.

Duterte ended up seated between Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.

Some government sources admitted not knowing the basis of the information relayed by Malacañang.

“We don’t know where they got that,” an official who declined to be named said.

Asked to explain the erroneous information released by his office, Andanar said: “No, it was supposed to happen tomorrow once Lao-PDR transfers the chairmanship to our country and based on the protocol, we are made to believe that it is going to be our President, president of Lao and Barack Obama, or vice versa.”

He was referring to yesterday’s formal turnover of the ASEAN chairmanship to the Philippines, which will host the conference next year.

“But then again things can be changed right on the spot. For instance, the ASEAN-China meeting, even the lineup of those who can talk first, second, third was changed. So these things may change.”

Sen. Alan Cayetano, an ally of Duterte and chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, said the news about Duterte sitting between Ban and Obama created “excitement.”

“Even the ministers, because we were going around, getting to know the others. Even they were asking us, with either Sec. Gen. Ban Ki Moon and the President, or Barack Obama and President Duterte,” Cayetano said.
