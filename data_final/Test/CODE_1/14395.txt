WASHINGTON - The United States declared Thursday that the Islamic State group’s slaughter of Christians, Yazidis and Shiites amounts to a genocide and vowed to halt it.Secretary of State John Kerry made the proclamation after Congress demanded Washington recognize that the group seeks to exterminate religious minorities.“Daesh is genocidal by self-proclamation, by ideology and by actions, in what it says, what it believes and what it does,” Kerry declared.“Daesh is also responsible for crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing directed at these same groups, and in some cases also against Sunni Muslims, Kurds and other minorities,” he added.The Islamic State group has regularly carried out mass killings of Shiite Muslims, Christians and Yazidis. In June 2014 it seized the formerly cosmopolitan city of Mosul in northern Iraq, placing whole communities under threat of murder, rape or enslavement.Already in March last year, UN investigators warned the self-proclaimed caliphate was trying to wipe out Yazidis, members of a pre-Islamic religious minority.While genocide is a crime under international law, US officials say Kerry’s ruling does not put Washington under any more legal obligation to act.Instead, they argue, the United States is already doing its utmost to halt the slaughter by leading a 66-nation coalition to “degrade and destroy” the group. Kerry said the facts must one day be brought before an international tribunal, and that the United States would do all it could to support an investigation and prosecution. He said that through air strikes and support for local forces, the coalition has pushed IS fighters from 40 percent of the territory it once held in Iraq and 20 percent in Syria. “We’ve degraded their leadership, attacked their revenue sources and disrupted their supply lines, and currently we are engaged in a diplomatic initiative aimed at trying to end the war in Syria,” he said.Kerry argues Bashar al-Assad’s brutal campaign to cling to power in Syria fuels the chaos that allowed the IS group to seize the east of his country.He vowed to continue pressing for a negotiated settlement to the broader civil war to allow local forces and the international coalition to focus its fire on the extremist threat.“My purpose in appearing before you today is to assert that in my judgment Daesh is responsible for genocide against groups in areas under its control including Yazidis, Christians and Shia Muslims,” he said. “For those communities the stakes in this campaign are utterly existential,” he said. “So we must bear in mind after all that the best response to genocide is a reaffirmation of the fundamental right to survive.” The intensity of the conflict and the IS group’s history of murdering journalists, aid workers and suspected “spies” has made it difficult to document its crimes in great detail. But the group has itself issued propaganda videos showing the mass killing of prisoners, and issued its own legal rulings pronouncing that captured non-Muslim women slaves may be raped by its fighters. “We’ve not been able to compile a complete record, I think that’s obvious on its face,” Kerry admitted. “But over the past months we have conducted a review of the vast amount of information gathered by the State Department, by the intelligence community, by outside groups.”Kerry cited what he said was the August 2015 massacre of hundreds of Yazidi men and older women by the IS group, which trapped tens of thousands more on an exposed mountain without food or medicine.“Without our intervention, it is clear those people would have been slaughtered,” Kerry said, adding that thousands of Yazidi women and girls had been sold at auction. Kerry added that the group has executed Christians in northern Iraq and in Libya, where it also has a growing presence, and had sold Christian girls into sexual slavery.And he cited the murder of hundreds of Shiite Turkmen from minority communities in Iraq, accusing the group of a systematic effort to destroy the cultural heritage of ancient communities.”Meanwhile, the Islamic State militant group on Thursday released pictures of six men being executed on charges of “spying” for the Iraqi government in the city of Fallujah.In a statement posted on social media, the IS militants use three different methods to execute their victims, all wearing orange jumpsuits.“The judicial police carried out death sentences issued by an Islamic court in Fallujah against several apostates after they were convicted of spying,” the statement said.The United Nations said Thursday it was concerned that many of the 35,000 people recently displaced by fighting in Iraq’s Anbar province were still very close to the front lines.Thousands of civilians have been fleeing Hit, 145 kilometres (90 miles) west of Baghdad, as security forces close in on fighters from the Islamic State group hunkered down in the city.“The UN doesn’t have full access and we are very worried that some of the families who are escaping are in areas very close to the front lines,” the UN’s humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, Lise Grande, said in a statement.The UN said aid agencies were providing food, water and hygiene kits to some of the people displaced but stressed that the affected areas were hard to reach.Hit lies along the Euphrates, in the heart of Anbar, and is currently the main focus of the Iraqi security forces’ battle to retake ground lost to IS in 2014.Grande said the number of displaced people from Hit seeking urgent medical assistance was an indication of how hard the conditions were.“The mobile clinics dealt with 1,300 consultations during just their first two days,” she said.The UN said 53,000 people had already been displaced in Anbar province this year prior to the latest wave in the Hit area.According to the International Organisation for Migration, 44 percent of the more than 3.3 million people displaced in Iraq since the beginning of 2014 are from Anbar.The statement said only nine percent of the $861 million the UN and its partners requested in January to provide emergency relief to 7.3 million vulnerable Iraqis had so far been received.
