Jeremy Corbyn, pictured at a boxing gym yesterday, is ready to go into battle

For the second time in just three months, 33 top Labour officials are thrashing out the party's future at a crunch summit.

The timing of today's NEC meeting - 24 hours before voting closes for Labour leader - is so crucial the day's been dubbed 'Super Tuesday'.

So what is Labour's National Executive Committee, who sits on it, and what's on the agenda today?

The last question is the hardest to answer.

We know shadow cabinet elections and a leadership shake-up are on the table, but one source told the Mirror: "I'm completely confused myself."

Here's our best bet at what on earth is going on.

What is the National Executive Committee?

The NEC is Labour's ruling body. It has 33 members representing local parties, unions, MPs, MEPs and young activists.

It decides internal rules and process. That means 'control' of it has been a big talking point since Jeremy Corbyn took power.

At today's meeting it's thought to be split almost 50-50 in favour of the leader and the 'moderate' MPs challenging him.

That may not last. Two new Momentum-backed members, Rhea Wolfson and Claudia Webbe, replace two of Mr Corbyn's critics next week after winning elections over the summer.

Wasn't the NEC in the news before?

Yes!

The NEC held a now-infamous meeting in July saying people who joined Labour after January 12 shouldn't vote for its leader.

It also said Jeremy Corbyn could stand despite not having the support of 51 MPs.

Each of those decisions prompted a long, expensive and ultimately fruitless legal battle in the High Court.

Will today's meeting have the final say?

No.

Any changes to the Labour Party rulebook must be voted on by the party conference next week.

Changes over the summer weren't voted on by conference because they were about interpretation of the rulebook.

What's on the agenda today?

It centres around the future after Jeremy Corbyn is expected to beat Owen Smith in the Labour leadership election.

While detailed plans are still being thrashed out by rival factions, a few points are clear.

Shadow Cabinet elections

The NEC will discuss bringing back shadow cabinet elections after MPs backed the idea by a landslide.

Deputy leader Tom Watson wanted to give the right back to MPs, giving them more control over Corbyn's team if he wins.

After pressure from Team Corbyn, he is also putting forward a second idea which would broaden the elections to party members.

However, it appears Jeremy Corbyn's allies want to kick the detail into the long grass.

Sources say he would rather consider the elections as part of a wider review of party democracy after the Labour conference.

Under Mr Corbyn's ideal plan there will be a "brief consultation process" to decide the best way forward, they add.

It's claimed no firm formula for shadow cabinet elections will be decided today - even if the NEC votes to put the principle to conference.

A source close to Mr Corbyn said: "The feeling is that it's clearly wrong to table such a huge change at the last minute without proper consultation or process."

Daily Mirror Ed Miliband annoyed pretty much all Labour MPs with his 'One Member One Vote'

Ditching £25 registered supporters

Mr Watson wants to return to picking Labour's leader via electoral college - splitting members', unions' and MPs' votes into three equal blocks.

This would mean getting rid of £25 'registered supporters', whose introduction by Ed Miliband he called "rushed and unpopular".

This plan will be fought by Jeremy Corbyn and his team.

A spokesman for the Labour leader said: "We support the current system of one member one vote, which has led to a huge increase in membership and participation."

Everything else

Beyond this is where it gets complicated. Several different and unconfirmed ideas have been seeping out.

The Guardian reports Mr Watson may offer the leader a chance to sack rebellious shadow cabinet members - even if they won an election.

There are reports Mr Watson is willing to be ousted as chairman as part of a compromise.

He told the BBC: "I’d be very happy for someone else to take the onerous responsibility of trying to keep the Labour Party in order if that is the case."

Other possible ideas from Team Corbyn include putting a time limit on Mr Watson's term as deputy or insisting that either the next leader or deputy must be female.

Who are the 33 NEC members?
