Gloria Allred, women's groups plan protest to push for release of 'Apprentice' footage

Women’s rights lawyer Gloria Allred and several women’s groups are staging a protest in front of the production company MGM to call on the company and producer Mark Burnett to release unaired footage from “The Apprentice” that some people have suspected could include more damaging statements made by Donald Trump.

Allred, the California branch of the National Organization for Women, and the California Democratic Party Women’s Caucus will, according to a press release, “march into MGM’s headquarters in Los Angeles and deliver an open letter” stating that voters have a right to see the footage. Then they will convene a press conference outside of MGM headquarters. The protest is scheduled to occur at 2 p.m. PT."

“Releasing the tapes is a civic duty,” the press release read. “Trump has made a campaign issue of his attitudes about women, African Americans, Latina/os, and other marginalized groups by his own statements and policy proposals. Voters have a compelling need to view and hear what this man says about those issues behind the scenes.”

The pressure to release footage from The Apprentice has heightened since late last week, when a video surfaced of Trump, the Republican nominee, talking casually about kissing and groping women without their consent with Billy Bush, who was then a co-host of Access Hollywood. Bush has been suspended indefinitely from his co-host role on NBC's "Today" for his role in the video.

Burnett, who served as executive producer of The Apprentice, said yesterday in a joint statement with MGM that he does not have the ability to release footage from The Apprentice, contracting earlier reports that suggested he was intentionally trying to prevent them from leaking.

"MGM owns Mark Burnett's production company and 'The Apprentice' is one of its properties,” the joint statement reads, in part. “Despite reports to the contrary, Mark Burnett does not have the ability or the right to release footage or other material from 'The Apprentice.' Various contractual and legal requirement also restrict MGM's ability to release such material.”

Allred, who is known for taking on high-profile sexual harassment and discrimination cases, told Gothamist that she has been "contacted by women who allege inappropriate contact by Mr. Trump" since the release of the recording Friday.

An investigation by the Associated Press last week reported that Trump repeatedly "demeaned women with sexist language" during his time on the reality series. The Trump campaign has denied the claims.
