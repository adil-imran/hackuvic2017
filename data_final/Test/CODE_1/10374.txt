The US said terror group Islamic State has committed genocide against religious minorities in territories it controls.

US Secretary of State John Kerry has declared ISIS carried out these crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing against mostly Yazidis, Christians, and Shia Muslims in Syria and Iraq.

Kerry noted the group had always been genocidal by self-proclamation, by ideology, and actions.

Kerry said the US State Department, intelligence community, and other outside groups helped come up with this information.

He now calls for an independent probe and criminal charges against ISIS, adding Washington will do everything in its power to hold the group accountable.
