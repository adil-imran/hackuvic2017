Declare me winner, Trump says, as he narrows gap with Hillary in Michigan

Iraq Sun Friday 28th October, 2016

• Trump within striking distance of Clinton in Michigan: Poll

• Republican Kirk is dismissive of Democrat Duckworth’s military history

• Mike Pence’s campaign plane slides off runway in NY, no one injured

MICHIGAN, U.S. - When it comes to Donald Trump, nothing surprises anymore.

After his earlier remarks claiming the elections could be "rigged" and not committing to accepting the poll results during the third and final presidential debate, the Republican nominee now had this to say - "Just thinking to myself right now, we should just cancel the election and just give it to Trump," CNN quoted Trump as saying during a rally in Ohio on Thursday.

"Her policies are so bad. Boy, do we have a big difference," he said about his rival Hillary Clinton.

Trump said something on these lines during the primaries as well, wondering if voters couldn't just vote already because he was sitting so high in the polls. Then, he didn't joke about canceling the election and just giving it to him outright.

Most polls have predicted that Clinton is leading, with the election less than two weeks away.

However, in a boost for Trump, in Michigan, a state that has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988, Trump is close on the heels of Clinton.

In the latest Fox 2 Detroit/Mitchell Poll, Trump trails Clinton by just six points in a four-way poll. A Detroit Free Press/WXYZ-TV poll places Clinton ahead of Trump by 7 points, a much smaller gap compared to previous polls.

The latest numbers in Michigan, and other states, including battleground Ohio, will concern the Clinton campaign, with the former first lady warning her supporters against overconfidence, which may result in some supporters remaining home on Election Day.

Another key state is Florida, if Clinton wins the state, she will almost certainly be the next president of the United States.

Currently, most polls on Florida point to a narrow Clinton victory.

And after a particularly turbulent election race with both sides trading nasty accusations, the two candidates have refused to commit on whether they will work together after the election is over.

“I just want to make that decision at a later date,” Trump said in an interview, when asked whether he would cooperate with a Clinton administration. Clinton, meanwhile, sidestepped the question. “I certainly intend to reach out to Republicans and independents, and the elected leadership of the Congress,” she told reporters.

Trump campaign

Trump is also facing allegations of a different kind by Clinton that he hired undocumented workers to help build his new hotel in Washington, D.C.

The businessman-politician rejected the charges outright. “I didn’t hire one illegal immigrant to build Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue,” Trump said at a rally Wednesday night in Kinston, North Carolina.

The Republican candidate has seen his fundraising fall in the month of October, putting him at a severe financial disadvantage in the crucial final days of the White House contest, new campaign finance reports filed on Thursday night showed.

Kirk dismisses Duckworth's military history

Republican Mark Kirk invoked Democrat Tammy Duckworth’s ethnicity as she explained her family’s military background during the Illinois Senate debate on Thursday – prompting an outcry from national Democrats who called Kirk’s comments a “racist” attack.

Duckworth, a veteran who lost both her legs fighting in the Iraq War, was making a case for having a senator who has fought in a war when she detailed her family’s lengthy military background.

Kirk, while responding, appeared dismissive of Duckworth's heritage, saying, “I forgot your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington.”

There was no response from Duckworth, and after a few moments of silence, the moderator moved onto the next question.

Pence's plane skids off runway in NYC

Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence’s campaign plane slid off a runway during a rainstorm at New York’s LaGuardia Airport late Thursday.

There were no injuries reported in the rough landing due to the bad weather. The 37 passengers, including Pence, and 11 crew members were evacuated through the back of the plane.
