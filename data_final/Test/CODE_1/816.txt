The Rape That Feminists Forgot

Townhall.com ^ | August 21, 2016 | Paul Jacob

Posted on by Kaslin

Rebecca Schoenkopf was just minding her own business, as owner, editrix and publisher of Wonkette, a blog billing itself as a Nasty Vile Little Snark Mob, when she hastily posted her commentary entitled, Lets Talk About Juanita Broaddrick.

A feminist, Ms. Schoenkopf explained to her readers why raping Juanita Broaddrick, which she tends to believe Bill Clinton did almost four decades ago, doesnt make Bill a bad guy . . . or even a bad feminist.

To sum up, I think Bill Clinton could very well have raped Juanita Broaddrick; that it doesnt make him an evil man, or irredeemable, she wrote. It doesnt even necessarily make him a bad feminist  you know, later, once he stops doing that.

Which calls the question: Has Bill stopped doing that?

For those who missed the 1990s, Juanita Broaddrick accused then-President Bill Clinton of sexually assaulting her in a Little Rock, Arkansas, hotel room back in 1978, when Mr. Clinton was the states attorney general. Friends of Broaddrick confirm that she told them about the rape at the time, and they witnessed her swollen lip. But she made no public charge for decades.

In an affidavit in the Paula Jones case, Broaddrick originally said under oath that she was not attacked by Bill Clinton. But in 1998, after being granted immunity for perjury by special prosecutor Kenneth Starr, Broaddrick reversed herself, alleging that she had indeed been raped by Mr. Clinton.

Her account was detailed in a 1999 NBC Dateline segment. No one can objectively look at Juanitas story and not be troubled, NBCs Lisa Myer recently told BuzzFeed. Myer also recalled explaining NBCs delay in broadcasting the piece at the time by telling Broaddrick, The good news is youre credible. The bad news is youre very credible.

Fast-forward to the current presidential campaign, where the story came back into the news after presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted last year: To every survivor of sexual assault . . . You have the right to be heard. You have the right to be believed. Were with you.

Irked, Broaddrick tweeted back in January: I was 35 years old when Bill Clinton, Ark. Attorney General raped me and Hillary tried to silence me. I am now 73. . . . it never goes away.

What does Bill Clintons bad behavior or allegedly even worse behavior have to do with Hillary running for president? Certainly, shes not her husband. But then again, she has suggested shell have him working alongside her handling the small stuff, such as the economy.

[M]any people have found [Broaddricks] charges pretty credible. She has there [have] also been questions of Hillary being instrumental in some kind of cover-up or some kind of pressure on her to retract those charges or to be quiet. And I have no idea what happened. I have no idea whether those things are true, Liza Featherstone, a contributing editor at the ultra-liberal The Nation, recently said to Amy Goodman on Democracy Now! But I actually dont think that those things should be dismissed. I think, you know, how a woman in power treats a much less powerful woman, who has accused a powerful man of raping her, actually is important.

You dont say.

Elsewhere, the media reaction has been tepid. When Donald Trump referred to the former president as a rapist, NBC News originally reported that Broaddricks accusation had been discredited, only to abandon that claim when confronted. Perhaps BuzzFeeds Katie Baker is correct in arguing that the political implications of her claims are too disastrous for liberal politicians and pundits . . . to rally around her, especially this close to election day. That means only Clinton-hating conservatives are visibly incensed by her claims, and the more that they amplify Broaddricks story, the more skeptical progressives become.

True rape victims must always have a proper partisan alignment. Is that the new feminism?

Rape is about power, not sex. For those for whom its about power, those are the serial rapist guys, and they hate women and want to punish us, contends Wonkette editor Schoenkopf. But I dont think thats in every case. I think good men can rape, and be sorry, and not do it again. This is very bad feminism.

She adds, parenthetically, Especially if youre, say, a teenager whose impulse control is still years away from being properly developed.

Note: Bill Clinton was not a teenager when he allegedly raped Broaddrick.

Ms. Schoenkopf went on to differentiate rape today from way back in the dark ages before the 1980s: I can absolutely see Bill Clinton doing this (then, not now) and not even thinking of it as rape, but thinking of it as dominant, alpha sex. I can see a LOT of men doing that during that time period, before we started telling them in the 80s, hey, that is rape, do not do that. I can see YOUR NICE GRANDPA doing that, back then.

In her follow-up piece, she doubled down, explaining, truly  back then, men were taught that a girl has to say no a couple times before she says yes, so no one will think she is easy.

Schoenkopf does think Bill Clinton a jerk. And raped at least one woman. But then, she thinks all men are very likely rapists. But no biggie: were all redeemable . . . and that youd be dismayed to learn some of your loved ones secrets  that its very likely they too pushed a woman past consent . . .

It seems common sense has been assaulted.

This sort of thinking was considered out-moded even then. On the contrary, this sort of thinking was derided as "how women were expected to behave" way back in the Dark Ages of the 1950s. Which makes me think that women didn't think like this in the 80s, or the 70s, or the 60s, or the 50s ... Progressives ALWAYS think that people in the past were stupid and totally unenlightened, whereas people of "today" are brilliant and insightful and much more aware and together. You know: millennials. They've got it all figured out.

Nurse backs up Clinton rape charge

Attended Broaddrick's wounds after alleged assault in Arkansas June 26, 2003 [a few excerpts from article...] Kelsey recalls Broaddrick saying the meeting with Clinton began with small talk, and "she was a little surprised he was by himself." "She said he was showing her locations outside the window there in Little Rock, and then, all of a sudden, he just kind of grabbed her and started kissing her," remembers Kelsey. "He overtook her and pushed her to the bed, and from that point on it was just a rape." Kelsey says Broaddrick explained how her lip became swollen: "He bit her lip to try to keep her from struggling with him. http://www.wnd.com/?pageId=19483 ******************************************************************* From 1999...

Bill Clinton's long history of sexual violence against women By Daniel J. Harris

& Teresa Hampton

Capitol Hill Blue Although the White House has successfully intimidated NBC News into deep sixing an explosive interview with an Arkansas woman who says Bill Clinton raped her 20 years ago, Capitol Hill Blue has confirmed that the charge is but one of many allegations of sexual assault by the President. A five month investigation into the President's questionable sexual history reveal incidents that go back as far as Clinton's college days, with more than a dozen women claiming his sexual appetites leave little room for the word ''no.'' Juanita Broaddrick, an Arkansas woman who worked on Bill Clinton's campaign when he was attorney general, told NBC's Lisa Meyers two weeks ago she was raped by Clinton. NBC, under intense pressure by the White House, shelved the interview. The White House also threatened Fox News Tuesday after it reported the story. But Broaddrick's story is only one account of many sexual assaults by Clinton. Among the other incidents: A 1969 charg e by a 19-year-old English woman who said Clinton assaulted her after she met him at a pub near the Oxford University campus where the future President was a student. A retired State Department employee, who asked not to be identified, confirmed this week that he spoke with the family of the girl and filed a report with his superiors. Clinton admitted having sex with the girl, but claimed it was consensual. The victim's family declined to pursue the case;

She later recanted that interview and said had been threatened by Clinton supporters into claiming the sex was consensual.

A former Washington, DC, political fundraiser says Presidential candidate-to-be Clinton invited her to his hotel room during a political trip to the nation's capital in 1991, pinned her against the wall and stuck his hand up her dress. She says she screamed loud enough for the Arkansas State Trooper stationed outside the hotel suite to bang on the door and ask if everything was all right, at which point Clinton released her and she fled the room. When she reported the incident to her boss, he advised her to keep her mouth shut if she wanted to keep working. The woman has since married and left Washington.

Kathleen Willey, a White House volunteer, reported that Clinton grabbed her, fondled her breast and pressed her hand against his genitals during an Oval Office meeting in November, 1993. Willey, who told her story in a 60 Minutes interview, became a target of a White House-directed smear campaign after she went public. In an interview with Capitol Hill Blue this week, the retired State Department employee said he believed the story of the young English woman who said Clinton raped her in 1969. ''There was no doubt in my mind that this young woman had suffered severe emotional trauma,'' he said. ''But we were under tremendous pressure to avoid the embarrassment of having a Rhodes Scholar charged with rape. I filed a report with my superiors and that was the last I heard of it.'' Capitol Hill Blue also spoke with the former Washington fundraiser who confirmed the incident, but said she would not go public because anyone who does so is destroyed by the Clinton White House. ''My husband and children deserve better than that,'' she said. The other encounters were confirmed with more than 30 interviews with retired Arkansas state employees, former state troopers and former Yale and University of Arkansas students. Like others, they refused to go public because of fears of retaliation from the Clinton White House. Likewise, the mainstream media has shied away from the Broaddrick story. Only The Drudge Report and other Internet news sites have actively pursued it. The White House did not return calls for comment Tuesday night. https://web.archive.org/web/19991007004657/http://www.capitolhillblue.com/Feb1999/020399/clintonrape020399.htm *******************************************************************

This is my boilerplate because it is a universal, timeless and unchangeable truth: When a liberal pushes an issue it is far more about how well that issue advances the end goal to impose the Secular Utopia on us than it is to address the issue at hand. So every word, every action every emotion and every advocacy has a broader goal. Liberalism is a power-focused religion even though it lacks an embodied deity. Christianity is a principle-focused religion, the principles being summarized in the words of Jesus to love your neighbor as yourself, and listed as the Ten Commandment. True Christianity is the mortal enemy of liberalism. That is why in every way liberals wage war against Christianity and against everything Christian, even if that war is conducted via guild and with proxies, like is being done at this very moment using “race”. So, when someone says: “To sum up, I think Bill Clinton could very well have raped Juanita Broaddrick; that it doesnt make him an evil man, or irredeemable, she wrote. It doesnt even necessarily make him a bad feminist  you know, later, once he stops doing that. They are telling me everything I need to know about both parties.

This is sick. Willie belongs in jail along with his crooked, enabling “wife”. Juanita Broderick is a heroine who just won’t go away. The Trump campaign need an ad with her story and the comparison to what Hitlery says about rape victims. But that would bring cries from people like this feminist who say it doesn’t really matter that Bill is a rapist. And surely it doesn’t matter that Hitlery enabled him and tried to silence Juanita. Again, this is just sick.

I actually listened to the stories of my grand mother and mother, so I’m going back to 1900. And ‘no’ always meant ‘no; it was never 3 times ‘no.’ In fact, this whole ‘no’ crap is evil. Good and decent men do not rape women. Period. Rape is an act of violence and lust as is clearly different from the act of love.
