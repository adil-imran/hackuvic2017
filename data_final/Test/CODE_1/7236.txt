Will fin breid, barley-bree an paintit room. Whan MacLean meets wi's friens in Springburn. Aa thae roses an geeans will turn tae blume. An a black laud frae yont Nyanga. Dings the fell gallows o the burghers doun.

Black an white ane-til-ither mairriet. Mak the vile barracks o thair maisters bare. Sae come aa ye at hame wi freedom. Never heed whit the houdies croak for Doom. In yer hous aa the bairns o Aidam.

Tak the road an seek ither loanins. Wi thair ill-ploys tae sport an play. Nae mair will our bonnie callants. Merch tae war whan our braggarts crousely craw. Nor wee weans frae pitheid an clachan. Murn the ships sailin doun the Broomielaw. Broken faimilies in launs we've hairriet. Will curse 'Scotlan the Brave' nae mair, nae mair.

Roch the win i the clear day's dawin. Blaws the clouds heilster-gowdie owre the bay. But thair's mair nor a roch win blawin. Thro the Great Glen o the warl the day. It's a thocht that wad gar our rottans. Aa thae rogues that gang gallus fresh an gay.

YOUR readers should know that Alan Riach’s piece about art and universality omitted some interesting points (Alan Riach: Why do Unionists want art to be universal?, The National, April 29).

First of all, Stravinsky loathed nationalism. He treasured the language and music and religious traditions of his childhood, but nationalism he detested. This is abundantly clear in Stephen Walsh’s two-volume biography, and is fascinatingly explored by Isaiah Berlin in correspondence to Chimen Abramsky in 1972.

And have a look at what Stravinsky thought of Balakirev – who was a nationalist composer in the sense that he wrote music premeditatedly, with the idea of “Russian-ness” actively in mind.

It’s the premeditated aspect that makes it nationalistic.

On the contrary, in the Western world, and indeed further afield (eg Japan), I think that the likes of Beethoven and Brahms are universal, and that their universality is indeed shaped by their Germanness. But if they had written premeditatedly German music, they would not have been Beethoven and Brahms.

My own writing has been called quintessentially English, and I think I know what people mean by that. I’ve lived all my life in Aberdeen and the English language is what I am.

But I’m not an English nationalist. I’m British, I speak English, and I write. We should all treasure our native tongue.

Finally, on Sibelius, surely no one can seriously locate traces of nationalism in the numbered symphonies. He famously said that while most other modern composers were engaged in manufacturing cocktails of every hue and description, he was offering the public cold spring water.

Of course, he did write some overtly nationalist pieces, but he came to have serious misgivings about Finnish independence. This is a central theme of the recent biography by Glenda Dawn Goss, published by Chicago University Press

AS a descendant of evicted islanders who were nearly drowned on an emigrant voyage to Canada, I think that all Highland castles should either be demolished or used as museums to educate the public about the genocide, brutality and evictions that devastated the Highlands for over a hundred years (Castles in the Mist, The National, May 2).

Often the people were evicted at the point of British army bayonets or by baton-wielding policemen. The Highland Clearances is believed to be the longest period of ethnic cleansing in Europe – from 1784, when the Duke of Athol evicted the population of Glen Tilt, Perthshire, until the early 1900s when Lady Gordon Cathcart was filling the holds of fetid emigrant ships with men, women and children from Uist and Barra.

In 1840 the chief government relief officer for Scotland noted that: “The aim of the Highland landlords is the extermination of the people.” No action was taken by the British Government to stop the evictions. Of course many of the perpetrators were sitting in the House of Commons or House of Lords with Lord MacDonald, the Marquis of Stafford (Duke of Sutherland) and Sir James Matheson being just three of the most prolific tyrants.

Whilst Highlanders and Islanders were being evicted from the land, their husbands and sons were fighting and dying from the Plains of Abraham to Assaye for the greater glory of Britain whilst at the same time the same British state was destroying their Gaelic language, culture and even evicting their families.

The mass of the inhabitants of the Highlands and Islands were dispossessed by the unrelenting avarice of the Anglicised clan chiefs and landlords. They made the Highlands the largest man made wilderness in Europe.

Sunset Song adaptation is shocking, engaging and moving

HAVING read Lewis Grassic Gibbon’s Sunset Song many times, seen several stage productions, and fondly remembering the BBC Scotland adaptation, I approached the recent Terence Davies film adaptation with the protective apprehension of a fan.

This was blown away by the film I then viewed. The film does not deserve to be written off as “cultural vandalism” as Alasdair Forbes does (Letters, The National, May 3). Basing his “evaluation” on having only watched part of the film, he wonders if Terence Davies had ever read the book.

This is hugely insulting to a director and screenwriter of Davies’ calibre and quality. Mr. Forbes surely has to explain what Davies might have based his own screenplay for Sunset Song on! Terence Davies showed incredible tenacity in striving for years to get this film made, clearly a labour of love for him. It engaged, shocked and moved me. Nothing tended to and nurtured this sensitively can be seriously taken as cultural vandalism.

I wonder: would Mr Forbes’s reaction be the same if this had been made by, say, an Eastern European director? Why am I hearing Braveheart’s Mel Gibson saying: “you can take our land, but you can never ... be trusted tae represent the likes o us?”

THE grotesque spectacle of Donald Trump’s victory effectively clinches the Republican nomination, for a fascistic candidate who has campaigned on a programme of racist attacks on immigrants and Muslims, extreme nationalism and militarism, including supporting torture and mass killing of civilians.

It’s unfortunate that this opportunistic, demagogic game of playing on physical fear (“Muslim terrorists out to take your life”) and economic fear (“Mexican workers out to steal your jobs”) has resonated among so much of the country’s white population.

Instead of aggressively challenging the Republican candidates’ inflamed rhetoric, Trump’s opponent have cowered.

America is headed towards an even less liberal democratic order than now exists — one marked by more religious intolerance, more restrictions on civil liberties, and more immigration rules designed to keep out migrants.

Trump reflects the turn of the financial mafia of which he is a part toward fascistic politics. He has been able to attract support from certain sections of the working class primarily because of the viciously anti-working-class policies of Obama and the Democrats.

I WAS pleased to see The National running the story about Greenpeace leaking TTIP documents which reveal that big business has had a privileged voice in the negotiations whilst everyone else, including our elected representatives, have been excluded (TTIP documents leaked by Greenpeace describe a deal that ‘puts business before citizens’, The National, May 3).

The same situation pertains to the deal with Canada, CETA, which looks set to pass its first ratification hurdle on June 23. However, CETA is seldom mentioned and we appear to be powerless to stop it. A simple majority of 15 from the 28 EU trade ministers will set the path ahead.

The European Commissioner in charge of negotiating these “trade deals” is Cecilia Malmstrom. Recently she was asked how she responded to the fact that nearly 3.5 million European citizens had signed a petition against CETA and TTIP. Her reply was that she “didn’t take her mandate from the European people”. This raises the question as to who she does take a mandate from? Is it not her job to do her best for all of the 500 million European citizens? It would appear not. This whole system fails to meet any definition of democracy.

Further down the road, we will face another deal called the Trade in Services Agreement. It too is totally secret. It looks to “liberalise” all kinds of services across 46 countries, such as education, public transport, energy provision, sanitation, health care and financial services.

Who is speaking for the ordinary people in these toxic trade deals? Most people know nothing about them at all. We don’t matter, we are there as consumers to provide ever-increasing revenue for greedy global corporations.
