A French former gym manager is believed to have been promoted to the top of ISIS to co-ordinate attacks on the West as a reward for planning the Paris massacre.

Abu Suleyman al-Faransi has been given a senior position in the terror group's foreign intelligence branch, the first Western European to rise to such an elite rank, according to a defector.

He is said to have impressed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi after presenting him with a blueprint for November's gun and suicide bomb attacks that killed 130 people in the French capital.

There are also indications the militant – dubbed the French emir of ISIS – may have been behind last month's Brussels attacks.

A French security source described him to The Daily Beast as the 'head of overall operations for Europe' while a senior U.S. official said there is 'good' intelligence that appears to confirm his role.

His meteoric rise suggests the terror group is shifting its focus to spearheading attacks on the West using militants with European backgrounds to fine-tune operations.

An ISIS defector known as Abu Khaled said Suleyman was 'smart, disciplined, well respected... and more sophisticated' than his predecessor Abu Abdelrahman.

He said Suleyman had the advantage of being 'born, raised and educated in France' and was often mistaken for a white convert due to his light-skinned appearance.

'He knows Western culture very well, its strengths and its weaknesses,' he added.

The son of an imam, Suleyman is said to have run fitness clubs in Paris before fleeing to Syria with his wife and two children at some point during the civil war.

His wife, who is a French citizen, is expecting their third child.

The militant, whose real name has not been disclosed, is the second jihadi to go by the nom de guerre Abu Suleyman al-Faransi who has been linked to the Paris attacks.

The other, Charaffe al Mouadan, who had direct ties to the Paris 'mastermind' Abdelhamid Abaaoud, was killed in a U.S. drone strike in December while reportedly plotting other attacks.

Abaaoud, 28, was killed in a police raid in north Paris days after the coordinated shootings and bombings in the French capital on November 13.
