Leader Urges Poets to Publicize US' Disloyalty to JCPOA

TEHRAN (FNA)- Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei called on Iranian poets to highlight and focus on the treacherous behavior of the US concerning its commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).

"In addition to the politicians, the artists, specially the poets, should transfer these realities to the public," Ayatollah Khamenei said in a meeting with a number of poets and veteran literary people from Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and India in Tehran on Monday night.

Iran's Supreme Leader described poets as invaluable assets of the nation and stressed the need for them to compose verses which would be dynamic and timely while offering views on the main issues and needs of the country.

"The poem should be used as an effective instrument in fulfilling responsibilities," the Supreme Leader added.

Last week, Ayatollah Khamenei warned the US presidential candidates to watch their mouth when speaking of the Vienna nuclear deal, stressing that Tehran will also ditch the agreement if future White House leaders show disrespect and discard it.

"We do not violate the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action also known as the nuclear deal), but if the opposite party violates it and tears it apart as the US presidential candidates state and threaten at present, then we will burn it," Ayatollah Khamenei warned during his remarks at a meeting with the heads of the three branches of power, high-ranking officials and different government bodies and armed forces on the occasion of the holy month of Ramadan here in Tehran.

The Iranian leader's warning was deemed as a general message to the political brass in Washington, but seemed to be more addressed to the US presidential candidate, Donald Trump. The totally estrange presidential nominee has repeatedly warned that he would tear apart and discard the nuclear deal with Iran on day one of office if he is ever elected, while his Democrat rival Hillary Clinton has said that she would remain loyal to the deal although she has vowed to be tough on Iran.

The Iranian leader further blasted the US for hypocrisy in return for Iran's honesty, saying, "As regards the JCPOA, the opposite party has defied its duty that has been removing the sanctions, the problem with the banks has not yet been resolved, the oil tankers insurance is done at a limited scope, the crude revenues and our money that are in other countries are not given back to us and the Americans have not fulfilled a major part of their undertakings, while we have done our part and shut down the 20-percent enrichment at Fordo (nuclear enrichment facility) and Arak (heavy water reactor)."

He also warned that the hostilities between Tehran and Washington would not end as the US is resolved to topple the Islamic Republic. "It is wrong to assume that we can come along with the US, this is wrong and we cannot rely on illusions as their issue is with the life and essence of the Islamic Republic and this cannot be resolved through negotiations."

Yet, Ayatollah Khamenei reiterated that the arrogant party seeking continued animosity is not Tehran, but Washington that wants regime change in Iran.

"Some imagine that hostilities are the result of our belligerence towards the US; (then if that's true) what has the Islamic Republic done to France? Why did France play the bad cop in the nuclear talks and why are the Netherlands and Canada showing enmity (towards Iran)," the Supreme Leader asked.

The US has been lagging in implementation of the last July nuclear deal with Iran. Months after the implementation of the nuclear deal, Iran is complaining that the US has not shown its loyalty to the agreement in action.
