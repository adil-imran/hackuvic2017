Increasing numbers of corpses are being found in Burundi’s Mubarazi River - one recently found decapitated, and others weighed down by stones, writes Shannon Ebrahim.

Imagine if decomposing bodies were emerging in the Crocodile, Tugela and Orange Rivers. Imagine, too, if increasing numbers of women were being raped by policemen and ruling party youth league members in their homes in KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and Gauteng. One would sincerely hope that the southern African region wouldn’t sit back in apathy.

This is precisely what is happening in Burundi on an ongoing basis, but we don’t talk about it or read about it any more. Increasing numbers of corpses are being found in Burundi’s Mubarazi River - one recently found decapitated, and others weighed down by stones.

According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), no autopsies have been done, and no investigations launched.

A few months ago, HRW interviewed 70 Burundian rape victims who had fled to the Nduta refugee camp in Tanzania. Many reported having been repeatedly gang-raped by members of the ruling party’s youth wing, the Imbonerakure, in or near their homes.

They believe they were targeted as the family members of perceived government opponents. The president of the ruling party, Pascal Nyabenda, was asked in writing to respond to the allegations of ongoing rape, but no response was forthcoming.

Prominent journalists and human rights activists continue to disappear without a trace. Jean Bigirimana, the well-known newspaper journalist, disappeared in July, followed by numerous unconfirmed reports that he was taken by the intelligence services.

Needless to say the government denies this. Just last month, an unknown gunman on a motorcycle shot Burundi’s leading human rights activist Pierre Clavier Mbonimpa in the head, although he has survived with serious injuries.

If we don't speak up for these citizens of our continent, one day we may find that no one speaks up for us.

Following my visit to Burundi in February, I had reported that it was too dangerous for foreign journalists to operate in the country and that most had fled or been deported. Those brave enough to travel to the country despite the dangers have been meted out harsh treatment. Last month it was reported that the correspondent for Radio France International and AFP, Esdras Ndikumana, had been severely beaten by the intelligence services.

It is true that the government of Burundi has rejected the deployment of any kind of UN or AU force to prevent such killing and raping from happening, but does that justify our seeming indifference?

While President Pierre Nkurunziza was gloating earlier this year that he had warded off the intended deployment of an AU force to Burundi to keep the peace, a number of AU leaders are now simply looking the other way. Worse still, many are parroting the government’s propaganda that the rural areas of Burundi are at peace, and it is only the urban areas where the opposition is unhappy.

It's convenient to leave the problem in the lap of the East African Community (EAC) and to the well-respected former Tanzanian president Benjamin Mkapa, the facilitator of the Burundi peace talks. But the reality is that the EAC doesn't have the leverage to secure a sustainable peace agreement between the government and opposition.

Mkapa reported to the EAC heads of state last week in Arusha on the status of the talks and the situation on the ground in Burundi. He pulled no punches on the reluctance of the parties to participate in talks, and the significant points of divergence between the government and opposition - one being the Arusha agreement.

After months of painstaking mediation between the conflicting parties in Burundi on the part of former president Nelson Mandela and later deputy president Jacob Zuma, the Burundian government now wants to unravel the Arusha agreement which had brought peace to the country.

The government of Burundi has used its internal dialogue process, which analysts agree is highly politicised and stage-managed, to delegitimise the Arusha accords. The strategy is to declare that through its roadshow around the country, that the Arusha agreement no longer reflects the will of Burundians.

Mkapa also laid bare the politicisation of the Burundian security forces - the police, army and intelligence, and reported on how the opposition perceives there to be no political space left in the country.

While Mkapa presented a thorough and balanced report to the EAC, there doesn’t seem much that anyone is really prepared to do about it. If we are to truly realise African solutions to African problems, the AU will have to deal aggressively with the situation in Burundi, and find a way to intervene to ensure the protection of civilians.
