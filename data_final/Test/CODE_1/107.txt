LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) — A new Wikileaks email dump alleges Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager was contacted by a rock star and a former Apollo moon mission astronaut about the possible existence of UFOs.

Former Blink 182 guitarist Tom DeLonge sent two emails to John Podesta between Oct. 2015 and Jan. 2016, the first of which aimed to set up a meeting with “‘important’ people” who had “principal leadership” experience concerning a “sensitive topic.”

Images of surveillance aircraft, jumbo jets spewing vapor contrails across the backdrop of a triangular-shaped aircraft and a round metallic object floating above Earth’s atmosphere were also attached to the emails, according to Wikileaks.

A second email from DeLonge to Podesta with the subject line ” General McCasland” dated Jan. 25 makes apparent references to McCasland as a “skeptic” who “was in charge of all this stuff”, and even includes a reference to Roswell, New Mexico, which is most famous for being the site of an alleged UFO incident in 1947.

“When Roswell crashed, they shipped it to the laboratory at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. General McCasland was in charge of that exact laboratory up to a couple years ago,” DeLonge wrote.

While no responses from Podesta were included in the email dump, Wikileaks did release a Google Calendar notification that appeared to show a meeting scheduled with Podesta and DeLonge.

But the San Diego-based rocker wasn’t the only big name to contact Podesta on the subject of UFOs.

An email dated Aug. 18, 2015, from the email address “terribillionairs@aol.com” to Podesta begins “Dear John” and makes references to “the War in Space” and the existence of “extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI)”.

“Remember, our nonviolent ETI from the contiguous universe are helping us bring zero point energy to Earth. They will not tolerate any forms of military violence on Earth or in space,” the email stated.

The email – which is signed “Edgar Mitchell, Apollo 14 astronaut” – also includes attachments referencing a proposed treaty to prevent “the placement of weapons in outer space”.

Mitchell, who is became the sixth of only 12 men to step on the moon in 1971, had long been an advocate for what has been coined as the “UFO disclosure” movement prior to his death in February.

A statement from the Clinton campaign cited by the Wall Street Journal did not specifically reference DeLonge’s or Mitchell’s emails to Podesta, but did condemn Russia’s alleged role in the Wikileaks dump.

Podesta told USA Today in April that he believes Americans “can handle the truth” about UFOs and that, if elected, Clinton will push for a declassification on all government records on the notorious Area 51 in Nevada.
