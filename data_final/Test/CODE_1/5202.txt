She's been busy one shooting one film and getting ready to see another one released next month.

But on Tuesday, Jennifer Connelly was just being herself as she strolled to dinner with husband Paul Bettany and their two children Stellan, 13, and Agnes, five, in New York City.

Jennifer's ensemble was decidedly simple and she may have breezed by without a double take save for that bandaged finger on her right hand.

Family outing: Jennifer Connelly cradled a bandaged finger while going out for dinner with husband Paul Bettany and their children Agnes and Stellan in NYC on Tuesday

The 45-year-old actress cradled her injured digit tenderly while walking down the sidewalk with her brood.

Jennifer, however, kept her focus on her kids and English husband, and even clutched the family's umbrella in the event of rain.

The brunette beauty was dressed down in black trousers with a black crew-necked jumper and sensible patent leather shoes.

On the mend: While it's not known how the 45-year-old actress injured her finger, it appeared to be well looked after

Multitasker: Jennifer managed to carry her navy trench coat and Paul, 45, carried their daughter on his shoulders and the children's coats on his arm

Simple things in life: The couple's son Stellan played toss with the umbrella

A navy trench coat was slung over her arm in the event of a late summer downpour.

Paul, also 45, looked casually cool in faded denim jeans and a beige cardigan buttoned over a white T-shirt.

He had the children's coats folded over his arm and kept a hand on the couple's daughter.

R&R: After a busy summer filming Granite Mountain in New Mexico, Jennifer is enjoying family time in NYC before she begins promotional work for American Pastoral due out October 28

Mommy mode: Jennifer looked prepared for the autumn weather as she clutched the umbrella

Not too far to go: The family continued on their way down the sidewalk

At one point, Paul treated Agnes to a ride atop his shoulders while Jennifer and their son Stellan looked on.

Jennifer is also mom to son Kai, 19, from a previous relationship with photographer David Dugan.

Jennifer, meanwhile, spent much of the summer in New Mexico filming the upcoming drama Granite Mountain opposite Miles Teller and Jeff Bridges.

The film tells the story of a crew who fought the devastating wildfire in Prescott, Arizona that claimed the lives of 19 of the group.

Nature lover: Paul glanced up at the green-leafed trees

Granite Mountain is slated for release on September 22, 2017 in the US.

Jennifer is also looking forward to the October 28 US release of American Pastoral co-starring Dakota Fanning and Ewan McGregor, who also directed.

American Pastoral follows a hardworking man (McGregor) whose life is turned upside down by his daughter's radical political beliefs.
