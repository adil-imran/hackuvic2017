No, Mr. President, it is not the Muslim community that needs protection. It is the rest of humanity that must be protected from the scourge known as Islam and those who practice it

Hear Obama! Muslims Are Not The Victims, They Are The Perpetrators

Obama’s recent visit to the Islamic Society of Baltimore, a radical mosque with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, is a slap in the face to all Americans whose lives have been altered due to Islamic warfare. While Obama continues to lecture us about the “victimized” Muslim community here in the United States, his comments fly in the face of reality. Who is really victimized here? Before the influx of Muslims on to our shores, I can remember an America where we felt free to enter a school without security checks. I can remember going to concerts and sporting events without having my purse searched. It was possible to drive to the airport and get on a plane without waiting in line for security clearance, and one could attend Jewish services without having to worry about the temple being shot up.

Today, due to threats against Jews which stem from Quranic anti-Semitism, Jewish schools and temples have become fortresses. The cost for additional security guards and walls is enormous and a drain on temple funds already stretched from a decline in membership. Muslim anti-Semitism is rampant on college campuses where Jewish students are verbally and sometimes physically accosted by young Muslims. As a recent study conducted by the FBI bears out and contrary to Obama’s assertions, it is Jews and not Muslims who are the victims of hate. Of the 1,409 hate crimes in 2014, 65.4% were against Jews and only 13.2% were against Muslims. Due to Islamic warfare, our airports are under heavy security. As a result, we are subjected to long waiting lines, body scans, and pat downs. Muslim cab drivers in Minneapolis and New York city refuse service to those who carry alcohol and to those with dogs because in Islam, alcohol is forbidden and dogs are considered unclean. Yet, Muslim demands for accommodation are never ending. They require foot baths and prayer rooms at universities and airports at taxpayers expense, prayer time at public schools, separate swim hours at public swimming pools, public recognition and celebration of Islamic holidays, Halal meat in schools, restaurants, and supermarkets. They demand that crosses be removed from Georgetown University, a Catholic university, because it offends them. It is not Christians and Jews who are scheming to defy our Constitution, but rather it is Muslims. It is the Assembly of Muslim Jurists of America that proclaimed in a published paper in 2008 that the duty of Muslims is not to uphold the law of the land, but to make the laws of Allah supreme. When polled in 2007 by Pew Research, 26% of American Muslims supported suicide bombing. In 2015, 19% of Muslims Americans said violence is justified in order to make Sharia the law of the land, and 25% stated that violence against America was justified as part of the global jihad in a poll conducted by the Center for Security Policy in 2015.
