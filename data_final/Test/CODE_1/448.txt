A young woman who endured a three-month nightmare as a sex slave of Islamic State extremists has called upon the UK to take in more refugees.

ISIS stormed Nadia Murad Basee Taha's Iraqi village in August 2014 and captured the then 19-year-old before massacring members of her family.

The Nobel Peace Prize nominee is now pleading with the British government to take more refugees.

Nadia Murad, 21, has called upon the UK to take in more refugees. Her work since her harrowing ordeal, to raise awareness of the plight of the Yazidi community, has earned her a Nobel Peace Prize nomination

Nadia was part of the non-Muslim Yazidi community which was stormed by jihadis.

Six of her eight brothers were murdered in front of her alongside 300 other men from her village, before she was snatched and repeatedly raped by 'countless' men several times a day.

Her mother was killed while Nadia and her two sisters and teenage female cousins and nieces, were transported to the ISIS stronghold of Mosul with more than 150 other girls before being subjected to horrific sexual abuse.

She said she had to 'take herself off to another world' as she was brutally raped.

Nadia was eventually able to escape some three months later, fleeing to the safety of a refugee camp before finding asylum in Germany.

The UN has branded ISIS’s treatment of the Yazidi people a possible genocide, after the terror group launched a campaign of murder, rape, abuse and torture against the population.

The brave survivor said: 'What IS has done to the Yazidi people is genocide, the UK must offer more asylum to refugees'

Her father had died before the harrowing atrocity.

Calling on the UK to take in more refugees, Nadia told The Mirror: 'What IS has done to the Yazidi people is genocide, the UK must offer more asylum to refugees.

'So many are in camps and they have been through terrible suffering.'

The young girls were even raped as they were transported to Mosul. Nadia told the United Nations Security Council in December: ‘Along the way, they humiliated us. They touched us and violated us.

‘They took us to Mosul with more than 150 other Yazidi families. In a building, there were thousands of Yazidi families and children who were exchanged as gifts.

‘One of these people came up to me. He wanted to take me. I looked down at the floor. I was absolutely petrified. When I looked up, I saw a huge man. He looked like a monster.’

Nadia's two sisters also survived their ordeal - one is with her in Germany while her other sister is in a refugee camp in Iraq with her two surviving brothers.

She told The Mirror her 13-year-old nephew was being trained by ISIS to fight for them.

One niece escaped, but was later killed in an air strike.

Just last month, the brave survivor issued a chilling warning to the United States Senate, claiming ISIS would continue to be a threat to America unless the terror group was wiped out.

Speaking to the Senate Homeland Security Committee in June, she said the United States could expect further atrocities such as the recent attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando while the ISIS ideology continues to exist.

Addressing the United Nations Security Council last December, Nadia described the persecution the Yazidi people face under ISIS, which trades women and children from the minority population as ‘war booty’.
