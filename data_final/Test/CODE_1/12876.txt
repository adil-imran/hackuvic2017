Turkey is in the present day Europe and partly in Asia.

•Apostle Paul was a citizen of Turkey because Tarsus exists in Turkey.

•Christianity existed in Turkey for about 1,023 years while Christianity has only existed in Nigeria and Ghana for 172yrs starting from when Rev. Birch Freeman came to Badagry in 1842.

•The seven churches Jesus spoke to in Revelations 2 & 3(Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea,) existed in the old Turkey.

•The disciples were first called Christians in Turkey(Antioch)

•Turkey once had the largest Christian auditorium in Europe called Hagia Sophia in Constantinople.

•Mary the mother of Jesus was taken to Turkey by Apostle John and till date, her room has become a tourist centre.



TURKEY TODAY



•Present day Turkey now has 96% muslims & 0.02% Christians(less than 130,000).

•The Hagia Sophia(once largest church in Europe) was taken over by muslims and converted to a mosque for over 400yrs and later used as an Islamic Museum



WHY CHRISTIANITY COLLAPSED IN TURKEY



•Emphasis on doctrinal differences weakened the Turkish church.

•Rivalries amongst denominations

•Petty politics in church coupled with ethnic biases.

•The Turks were building big cathedrals instead of building men.

HOW IT HAPPENED



•Osman Ghazi discovered the disunity amongst Christians and used it to fight a Jihad that led to a mass genocide of the Armenians, the Hellen and Turks of that day. In fact, the weapon of war used was designed by a Turkish Christian.

•Many Christian women converted to Islam to save their lives and some were raped and killed.

•Osman Ghazi started the Ottoman empire which gave muslims political post and made it a religion of the state.



IS NIGERIA/GHANA HEADING THE WAY OF TURKEY



•Virtually all the mistakes the church in Turkey made, the Nigerian/Ghanaian church have made it.

•We are building Cathedrals at the expense of discipling men.

•Disunity amongst churches

•Ethnicity in the church

•Denominational rivalry, etc.

•Sharp division along doctrinal lines



MORE FACTS



•The spiritual foundation of Turkey is stronger than that of Nigeria/ Ghana and Christianity existed for over 1000yrs in Turkey unlike ours which is just 172yrs but Islam Radicalism uprooted it. If it can happen in Turkey, it can also happen IF we are not careful.

•The menace of Boko Haram has destroyed a lot of churches in the Northern Nigeria and it may take another 200yrs to evangelize Borno State alone.

•There is a secret agenda to Islamize Nigeria and other African nations as contained in Abuja declaration of 1989.



DON'T SAY IT CAN'T HAPPEN HERE, IF WE DON'T RIGHT OUR WRONGS AS A CHURCH.



SOLUTION



•HEART-FELT Intercession

•Aggressive evangelism- the terrorist reached out to the youths in the norths first and gave them AK-47 and bombs, if we had reached out to them on time,

they'll be carrying BIBLES today.

•Mission support:-God is holding the church responsible for Boko Haram, yet we are blaming the government. If we had supported missions and

missionaries, we would have those insurgents to Christ long ago.

•Unity of the church is key in winning this battle. The last but not the least christians should be actively involve in politics. Enough of these muslims political office holder with islamic adgenda.

The only reason I see the Nigerian church failing is hypocrisy. Yes, our religious leaders are hypocrites, their followers are even worse than them. Their actions are disgusting to God and man. Who will listen to a pastor who sleeps with the choir leader, milks his people dry, preaches only for material and financial gain, selfish, quick to tear his members down, lord it over the people under him, does not practice what he preaches ? How do you respect and consider the Christian life Holly and worthy of emulation when you look around you and see the shame and disgraceful lives they live day to day?

These are what will make people dump Christianity in future even if Moslems do not overtake it. 94 Likes 4 Shares

End time Malaise. Though started in Turkey very long time ago and Nigeria is just experiencing it now is a pointer to the fact that we don't Christ properly and don't follow His ways the way we should. Jesus is The Way, The Truth and The Life. No one makes Heaven without Him. The Church and/or Mosque of Nigeria is Nigeria and The God of Nigeria resides in Nigeria. The Way CAN, Roman Catholics, Anglican, The numerous Pentecostals, The Muslims, Moslems and the various Islamic Movements are going about Religion is absurd, selfish and unprogressive. Your suggested solutions are relevant but the most important solution is that we cast aside those foreign styles and build on Nigeria.

Turkey is a muslim country today because they were over ran by evil satanic jihadists and forced to convert at the pain of death and not because the church there was weak. That scenario can never happen in Nigeria cause they will be crushed. In truth islam is in decline today in Nigeria with several muslims renouncing islam on a daily basis and accepting christ. 87 Likes 9 Shares

The roman catholic and latin christians crusaders are to be blamed for the fall of constantinople, and contrary to you conclusion that they were all converted to islam is far frm the truth, rather the Christians in turkey vacated the country to neighbouring countries, so what the muslem took was the land and assets on it, and also few christians who could nt migrate,

Stop this arrogant expression of ignorance. Constantinople was the capital of the byzantine empire which was a christian dominated empire. Even though turkey as a country did not exist then, you can be rest assured that the people residing in the territory that makes up modern turkey then we're christians because the whole area fell under the former christian byzantine empire. And not only was turkey christian, other countries and territories like Syria, Egypt, Jordan, lebanon e.t.c were christian dominated areas before they were overran by marauding jihadists and the territories claimed for satan in the name of islam.

The crusaders never invaded any non christian country with the purpose of converting them to christianity. I challenge you to name a single country that was invaded for that purpose. The crusaders were primarily a defensive army whose primary objective was to defend European territories against attack from satanic jihadists. The only case of offensive military campaign carried out by the crusaders was when they went to capture and take over Jerusalem.

The situation of bokoharam and fulani herdsmen attack has created a fertile ground for the massacre of people of other faiths in which Christians make up a large number so yes Op is on point.



However, Op may have forgotten that the earth belongs to the Christians, not the Muslims, that it is the unchangeable decree of God the Almighty.



Yes, He permits the world to spill the blood of His children. He permits the death of His children through cold-blooded murder by religious extremists. In the end, Christ will return with His saints to rule the earth and usher the dawn of the new age which is endless where He rules and reigns with His children.



The script of world events has already been written even before the foundation of this world. Therefore, no matter what happens Christians come out on top in the end. 24 Likes

The time of awakening is here . Even now in Turkey there is massive conversion to Christ (yes! please do background checks)

Our nations will not lose the unction of Christ -amen



Please pray for the leaders of christian churches and stop attacking them , they bear much responsibility .



Moses in the Bible led 2-3 million people , these days some of our christian leaders pastor 10-20 million souls ! Their members are also spread across various nations and continents!

That for me also validate the power of God working through them .



They need our prayers and not condemnation or criticism . Remember Moses and the critics ! 11 Likes 1 Share

Chronic dunce, let's see your proof of when and where crusaders attacked and killed fellow christians Or are you mixing them up with sunni terrorists who are always killing the shites? The formation of military religious orders scandalised the Orthodox Byzantines, and crusaders pillaged countries they crossed on their journey east. Violating their oath to restore land to the Byzantines, they often kept the land for themselves. The early People's Crusade instigated a pogrom in the Rhineland and the massacre of thousands of Jews in Central Europe .and also The Fourth Crusade resulted in the sacking of Constantinople, effectively ending any chance of reconciling the East–West Schism and leading to the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Ottomans [/b]. Enlightenment historians criticized the Crusades' misdirection— that of the Fourth in particular, which attacked a Christian power (the Byzantine Empire) instead of Islam . David Nicolle called the Fourth Crusade controversial in its "betrayal" of Byzantium, and in The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire Edward Gibbon wrote that the crusaders' efforts would have been more effective improving their own countries.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades

.

Despite their oaths and the threat of excommunication, the Crusaders systematically violated the city's holy sanctuaries, destroying or stealing all they could lay hands on; nothing was spared, not even the tombs of the emperors inside the St Apostles church. The civilian population of Constantinople were subject to the Crusaders' ruthless lust for spoils and glory; thousands of them were killed in cold blood.Women, even nuns , were raped by the Crusader army , which also sacked churches, monasteries and convents. The very altars of these churches were smashed and torn to pieces for their gold and marble by the warriors who had sworn to fight in service of the Pope without question.



.

The Massacre of the Latins (Italian : Massacro dei Latini ; Greek was a large-scale massacre of the Roman Catholic (called "Latin&quot inhabitants of Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire , by the Eastern Orthodox population of the city in April 1182 . The Roman Catholics of Constantinople at that time dominated the city's maritime trade and financial sector. Although precise numbers are unavailable, the bulk of the Latin community, estimated at 60,000 at the time by Eustathius of Thessalonica, was wiped out or forced to flee . The Genoese and Pisan communities especially were decimated, and some 4,000 survivors were sold as slaves to the (Turkish) Sultanate of Rum .The massacre further worsened relations and increased enmity between the Western and Eastern Christian churches, and a sequence of hostilities between the two followed.
