Hillary Clinton was against Israel before she was for Israel before she was against Israel. And now she’s for Israel again. Uniquely, Hillary Clinton has so many flip-flops that you need a flow chart to get a handle on her positions as First Lady, Senator, Presidential Candidate I, Secretary of State and Presidential Candidate II. John Kerry had a shelf of flip-flops. Hillary Clinton has an entire closet full of flip-flops in different shades of stomach-turning fevered fuchsia, power pink and oligarch orange.

At AIPAC, Hillary Clinton delivered a very nice speech that someone else wrote for her. That’s usually what AIPAC is for. It’s where any politician can read off a pro-Israel speech from a teleprompter without believing a word of it. And no one is better at blankly reading things they don’t believe than Hillary.

After having claimed to be Obama’s “designated yeller” at Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, she told the crowd at AIPAC, “One of the first things I’ll do in office is invite the Israeli prime minister to visit the White House.” I’m sure Netanyahu can’t wait for that and for his next dental checkup.

Hillary Clinton mentioned the murder of Taylor Force, an Iraq War veteran in Israel, and her speechwriter quite correctly noted that, “Palestinian leaders need to stop inciting violence, stop celebrating terrorists as martyrs and stop paying rewards to their families.”

If only Hillary Clinton had been Secretary of State. She might have been able to do something about it.

Hillary Clinton was in two administrations which shoveled money into the PLO while ignoring its terrorism. In between them, Senator Hillary Clinton condemned the same incitement, warned that the Palestinian Authority was responsible for terror attacks and urged that foreign aid to the terror group be conditioned on a “cessation of Palestinian propaganda and hateful rhetoric.”

That was nine years ago.

Not only wasn’t foreign aid to the PLO curtailed, but the terror group began getting more money than ever while she was in office. Some emails batted around the idea of ending incitement in exchange for promoting the ethnic cleansing of the Jewish population of ‘67 Israel. That’s like asking the Nazis to stop being anti-Semitic in exchange for the Jews voluntarily going to concentration camps.

In her AIPAC speech, Hillary Clinton doesn’t mention using foreign aid as leverage to end terrorism. So she’s promising even less than she did nine years ago.

Hillary Clinton once again brought out her imaginary ceasefire with Hamas. This has become one of her “accomplishment” talking points that supporters are supposed to mention when asked what she actually did. Except that ceasefire had a half-life almost as long as one of Hillary Clinton’s political positions. An hour after the ceasefire, a dozen rockets were fired into Israel. The ceasefire was notable mainly for letting the media start stories with, “Today, the ceasefire was broken yet again.”

What Hillary Clinton’s “ceasefire” did was put the Muslim Brotherhood, which back then was in control of Egypt, thanks to Hillary, in charge of “mediating” between its Muslim Brotherhood terror arm in Gaza, Hamas, and its worst enemy, Israel. The only thing the ceasefire did was help Hamas prepare for its next round of attacks which were the most devastating and disturbing in their reach and depth.

Hillary Clinton told the AIPAC audience that she had “been sounding the alarm for a while now” on the demonization of the Jewish State. “We must repudiate all efforts to malign, isolate and undermine Israel and the Jewish people,” she urged. Meanwhile in private, she was reading and praising Max Blumenthal’s efforts to malign and demonize Israel and the Jewish people.

Max Blumenthal, the son of close Clinton associate Sidney Blumenthal, has called for the ethnic cleansing of Jews from Israel. His attacks on Israel were cited by the Kansas City Jewish Community Center gunman. Even Germany’s Ex-Commies decided that he was too extreme for them and veteran anti-Israel pundits expressed their concern about his raw hatred for the Jewish State.

But Max wasn’t too anti-Semitic for Hillary Clinton.

Hillary Clinton’s email inbox was a clearinghouse of rants about Israel and even plots to incite riots in Israel. Hillary’s speechwriter may be pro-Israel, but her closest advisers hate the Jewish State.

After all the sugar, she got down to the details, condemning Jews living in “settlements” in ’67 Israel and pushing for more negotiations with PLO terrorists. “Israelis deserve a secure homeland for the Jewish people. Palestinians should be able to govern themselves in their own state, in peace and dignity. And only a negotiated two-state agreement can survive those outcomes.”

Israelis can’t have a secure homeland as long as a terrorist state is breathing down their necks. And it’s a terrorist state that her husband put there. Decades of negotiations have produced nothing. There is no deal to be made here. No process, agreement or solution. Negotiating with Islamic terrorists doesn’t work.

Her AIPAC rhetoric is just a softer version of her 2010 Brookings speech in which she insisted, “The lack of peace and the occupation that began in 1967 continue to deprive the Palestinian people of dignity and self-determination. This is unacceptable.”

After all the flattery, the only thing Hillary Clinton has to offer is more of the same condemnations of Israel for not magically making an Islamic terror state work and for living in parts of Israel that Muslims conquered in 1948 and therefore feel permanently entitled to. Her only solution is more of the same failed policies that killed terrible numbers of Israelis and made much of the country into a terrorist haven. All Hillary did at AIPAC was bring back some of her old insincere Senate rhetoric.

Peace with Islamic terrorists isn’t possible. That is the fundamental error which drove Hillary Clinton to back the coup against Mubarak and regime change in Libya while assuming that the terrorists would learn to play nice once they got what they wanted. Instead the “moderate” Islamic terrorists she had put her faith in began murdering Christians and Americans. Just as the ”moderate” Islamic terrorists whom she supports in Israel have been murdering Jews and Americans. But Hillary has learned nothing from Egypt and Libya. She still demands that Israel make peace with Islamic terrorists.

Hillary Clinton was against Israel as First Lady when she embraced Arafat’s wife after her smears of the Jewish State. Then she pretended to be pro-Israel as the Senator from New York. As Secretary of State, she reverted to attacking Israel and aiding Islamic terrorists. Now Hillary has flipped and flopped again.

Which is the real Hillary? It’s easy to find the true Hillary by looking at her emails and her actions as Secretary of State. We can spot the anti-Israel rhetoric in her second memoir Hard Choices. It takes more to be pro-Israel than hiring a pro-Israel speechwriter. It takes a consistent pro-Israel record.

No matter which teleprompter she uses, Hillary Clinton’s record is still anti-Israel.
