Deceased persons who were massacred by suspected Fulani herdsmen at Nimbo community in Uzo-Uwani local government area of Enugu State recently, were buried yesterday amid tears.

It could be recalled that Fulani herdsmen invaded Nimbo community on the 25th of April 2016 killing several people and destroying properties worth millions of naira. The invasion attracted of condemnations from different quarters.

In a homily at the burial of nine persons killed by Fulani herdsmen yesterday, the catholic Bishop of Nsukka Diocese, Rt. Rev. Godfrey Onah called on President Muhammadu Buhari to do everything in his power to disarm Fulani herdsmen of their dangerous weapon, saying if nothing was done, the level of violence in the country would be on the increase.

He said everything must be done to disarm these aggressors, apprehend and punish the criminals according to the law, while urging the National Assembly not to yield to the pressure being mounted to give assent to grazing laws.

He said, “We join our voices to those of other Nigerians urging the legislative arm of our government not to contemplate any laws that would deprive us of our farmlands and means of sustenance in order to provide grazing grounds for Fulani cattle rearers

“Man does not live by cow meat alone; he also needs yam, coco-yam, rice, beans, maize, cassava vegetables, fruits which the cattle reaers no longer allow us to produce” he stated

Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuani in his address said the death of those killed will not be in vain , promising that justice must be done to bring the perpetrators of the dastardly act to book.

“We make bold to declare that their deaths can never be in vain and we pledge to do all that is within our legitimate means, to give them justice.

“Like the martyrs they have become, the spilling of their innocent blood is already saving souls as it has aroused in our people and indeed the whole nation, a burning impulse to do all that is necessary to prevent the future occurrence of similar incidents anywhere in the country”, he said.
