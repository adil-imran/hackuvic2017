For all the states in SE, and the south as a whole, it's just a question of time before we get another bloody attack by Fulani herdsmen... it will hit the news stands, everyone ll cry eww chi m oo! and that ll be it!!! Why is it that in all these murders, we have n't had even a single arrest by the security forces of the perpetrators? In the previous case, why were 80 Agwu youth rounded up and kept in detention for attempting to ward-off these marauders? People sit in the comfort of their homes and blab... use and arm your vigilante! youth no get liver! Governor na sidon look (yes the Nigerian system make them that way)! etc. forgetting that the Nigerian military and police is merely Fulani Armed Forces, protecting their brother-herdsmen.

Until the Igbo unite in their quest for a separate/ independent state, where they will have their own conventional Army, Police, Navy, Airforce et.c. that will man the borders of Igboland, so that even these incursions will now be treated as trans-national conflicts, all these arming of youth, fighting back, IGP visit to communities, etc. na nonsense!!!

Nothing to prove these were same men involved in Agatu killing. This video could as well be an old BokoHHaram video. Look closely towards the end they approached a desert-like area and the river could be lake chad.



No evidence that it's Agatu and we should be careful how we inform or misinform 28 Likes 1 Share
