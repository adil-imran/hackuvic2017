Hyderabad: Former Princely State of Hyderabad was a tragedy in the making from the very beginning which could have been avoided by not putting into action Operation Polo or what is popularly called Police Action, said famous writer, historian and lawyer, A.G. Noorani while referring to the events and circumstances that prevailed between 1947 and 1948.

He said this on Thursday while delivering a lecture, on Relations between Delhi and Hyderabad 1947-1948, organised by H.K. Sherwani Centre for Deccan Studies, Maulana Azad National Urdu University (MANUU).

Noorani said that the annexation of Hyderabad State by Indian Union was in the interest of majority of people.

Referring to several poets, literary figures and administrators of Hyderabad, Noorani said that Nizam got the best of talent from United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) and Berar, and oversaw the flourishing of a munificent cosmopolitan culture in Hyderabad.

Though generous in nature, Nizam "hovered on the fringes of modernity," claimed Noorani.

The Muslims were totally demoralized after the so-called Police Action, said Noorani. There was massacre of large number of Muslims during the Police Action that was followed by "complete purge of Muslims from the administration," alleged Noorani.

Nehru was very gentle to Nizam after the Police Action and would address him as "my friend" in his letters. The nationalist in Nehru, however, prevented him from allowing the Red Cross from investigating the violence against Muslims in Hyderabad during and after the Police Action.

Noorani blamed Jinnah for refusing to accept Louis Mountbatten's proposal to hold a plebiscite wherever the ruler’s religion differed from that of the majority of people. Jinnah wanted to "exclude Hyderabad from the plan," Noorani said.

Dr. Mohammad Aslam Parvaiz, MANUU Vice-Chancellor, in his presidential remarks described Noorani as a “bold author” and said that the people of Hyderabad State have accepted the change that was brought about in 1948.

Earlier, Prof. Salma Farooqui, Director H.K. Sherwani Centre for Deccan Studies, gave a brief introduction of the Centre and enumerated several research and related academic activities undertaken by it since its inception in 2012. She said that the Centre has a tie-up with two international organisations and undertakes one big research project every year.

Trading Network of the Deccan, the third research study by the centre was also released on the occasion by Noorani and Dr Parvaiz.
