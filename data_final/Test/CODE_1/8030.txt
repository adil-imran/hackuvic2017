The United Nations Gender and Governance program in Kenya is managed by the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). It was developed as a follow up to the Engendering Political Process Programme implemented in 2002 to support women to participate actively in 2002 general elections.



The GGP was developed by different stakeholders comprising women leaders and women centred civil society organisations and supported by the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and development partners such as the Swedish International Development Agency, the Royal Netherlands Embassy, the Royal Norwegian Embassy and DFID.

The Gender and Governance Programme is in its second phase, and it is a multi-stakeholder programme formulated to deepen the gains of the Engendering Political Process Programme (EPPP) in ensuring that women’s issues remain relevant in the national polity, to support transformative leadership across all levels and tiers of government that delivers for people and in particular delivers on gender equality and to strengthen women’s leadership within communities and at the national levels.

The overall goal of the GGP is to transform leadership and governance at all levels in Kenya in order to deliver on poverty reduction, access to basic needs and equality between and among persons
