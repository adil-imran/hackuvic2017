COUNCILLORS in the North have demanded action to prevent two popular villages from turning into "sin cities".

They said that furnished apartments that have popped up in Saar and Janabiya would eventually lead to the emergence of nightlife in the Northern Governorate which they claimed could include opening of clubs and liquor stores. During the Northern Municipal Council's weekly session yesterday, councillors warned that both villages located in constituency seven could be turned into the new Juffair.

They summoned officials from the Industry, Commerce and Tourism Ministry and the Bahrain Tourism and Exhibitions Authority (BTEA) to discuss ways to prevent an "escalation of the situation" at next week's session.

"All of the areas that have nightlife in Bahrain are located in the Capital Governorate, which is somehow understood considering that such things are expected at most capitals in the world, even in Islamic countries," said Council chairman Mohammed Buhamood. "However, when such activity starts expanding outside the capital and reaches the closest area to King Fahad Causeway then intentions are clear.

"No-one knows if the furnished apartment buildings in those areas are licensed as tourist facilities or are just buildings that tourists use to stay in during their weekends in Bahrain .

"Several cars with Gulf licence plates have been found parked outside those buildings and upon inquiry we found out that these places were much cheaper in price than Juffair or other areas in the capital." Mr Buhamood said the council expected a mass exodus similar to when families moved out of Juffair.

"Exceptional permits for nightclubs, discos and liquor stores will be presented to us in future, very near future, with tens of furnished apartment buildings surfacing in both villages, such a thing is expected," he added.

"I understand that development is imminent but shouldn't it be targeting GCC families and not GCC bachelors.

"I know that both Saar and Janabiya are still green, which means this has just started, but without control bad things will happen there unless the government intervenes.

"Juffair was dubbed as a family destination two decades ago until hotels and apartment buildings were built.

"Homes were then sold and people had to look for places elsewhere, we don't want that happening in Saar and Janabiya." The GDN reported that new tourism projects worth up to BD2 billion are in the pipeline as Bahrain targets 15 million visitors a year by 2018.

Tourist numbers are already rising, with 1,891,112 visitors last year arriving at Bahrain International Airport - up by 10.67pc from 1,708,826 in 2014.

There was also an 11.28pc increase in visitors across King Fahad Causeway, from 8,687,292 in 2014 to 9,667,056 last year, and a 10.06pc increase in port arrivals - from 59,431 in 2014 to 65,410 last year.

Fifty per cent of those coming through the causeway come for recreation and vacation and 22pc for shopping, while 41pc coming through the airport are in Bahrain to visit friends and family, 29pc for commercial or vocational business.
