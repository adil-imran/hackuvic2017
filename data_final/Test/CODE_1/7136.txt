President Zuma delivered the annual state of the Nation Address on 11 February 2016, the 26th anniversary of Nelson Mandela’s release from prison.

He referred to a number of anniversaries in 2016, including 16 June which will mark the 40th anniversary of the student uprising in Soweto and the centenary of Fort Hare university. He said there is a need to confront racism and that Human Rights Day 21 March 2016 will be a national day against racism. Human Rights Day in South Africa is on the anniversary of the Sharpeville massacre where 69 unarmed people peacefully protesting against apartheid’s pass laws were shot dead by police.

Much of the speech was on the difficult global economic context and its impact on South Africa. The IMF and the World Bank predict that the South African economy will grow by less than one per cent this year whereas South Africa’s National Development plan is based on achieving 5% growth. Revenue is likely to be less than budgeted and South Africa is at risk of a lower credit rating which will make borrowing more expensive.
