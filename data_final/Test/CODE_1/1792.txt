Theresa May was last night urged by former Tory Ministers to call off the ‘attack dogs’ in the bitter Brexit battles with Chancellor Philip Hammond.

Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan joined forces to make the demand after a bruising week for the Prime Minister, which concluded with her being ‘sidelined’ by other EU leaders at a Brussels summit.

It led Remain-supporting Conservatives to warn the country could be heading for a ‘dirty’ Brexit, with no ‘divorce’ deal being reached before the end of formal talks in 2019.

Mr Hammond has come under sustained fire from Downing Street and pro-Brexit Ministers

Mr Hammond has come under sustained fire from Downing Street and pro-Brexit Ministers.

It follows the revelation in last week’s Mail on Sunday that the Chancellor’s friends fear he could quit the Cabinet following policy rows over issues such as immigration and his determination to protect the independence of the Bank of England.

He was also angered by his exclusion from key No 10 meetings.

In the wake of our article, sources accused Mr Hammond of ‘undermining Brexit’, and he was publicly slapped down by Downing Street after suggesting that foreign students could be excluded from migration targets.

Now Ms Soubry has warned Downing Street to respect the Chancellor’s authority, describing him as ‘one powerful voice of reason’ in the Cabinet. Writing in today’s Mail on Sunday, the former Business Minister says it seems that ‘No 10 is out to isolate or intimidate’ Mr Hammond, adding: ‘Instead of turning their attack dogs on our business-minded Chancellor, No 10 needs to put him at the heart of the Brexit negotiations.’

Her call was echoed by former Education Secretary Mrs Morgan, who said: ‘The Chancellor is doing the right thing in making sure that we have the best possible relationship with Europe as we go through Brexit.

‘The Government should be concentrating on helping him to achieve that, rather than briefing and spinning against him.’

Downing Street sources were yesterday trying to play down claims that Mrs May had been ‘sidelined’ during her first EU summit, which concluded on Friday evening, describing the talks as ‘constructive’. After fighting off calls for Brexit talks to be held in French, Mrs May was made to wait until 1am before delivering her Brexit speech, which lasted just five minutes. And when he was asked what he thought of her debut, Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker simply said: ‘Pfff!’

The sniping prompted Mrs Morgan to warn of stormy times ahead. She said: ‘All the talk so far has been of a hard or soft Brexit. I fear a dirty Brexit will be more accurate.’

But a No 10 source said that Mrs May had received a ‘warm welcome’ in private talks with Mr Juncker and other EU leaders.

‘Juncker was courteous and constructive when they talked one to one,’ the source said.

‘In all our private discussions, other leaders said they were very sorry to see us go but now all they wanted was constructive talks. There was no hostility.’

Pro-Brexit Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ‘European Council president Donald Tusk is right: there can be no hard or soft Brexit – we either stay or we go. And the people voted to go, which means leaving the single market.’

He added: ‘I do not accept that there is any sort of campaign against Mr Hammond.’

In her article today, Ms Soubry writes: ‘I was shocked to learn that he was not informed in advance of Mrs May’s Conservative Party conference speech in which she criticised the governor of the Bank of England. Hammond has a right to be treated better than that. His exclusion from crucial Downing Street meetings is similarly worrying.’

Rupert Harrison, chief of staff to former Chancellor George Osborne, added to the controversy, saying ‘close co-ordination between No 10 and No 11 is a requirement for effective government in the UK, not an optional extra’.

The row comes as a rebel alliance of MPs opposed to a hard Brexit, led by Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg, prepare to table a motion next week demanding the right to block Brexit with a vote in Parliament if it means leaving the single market. More than 20 Tories are predicted to join the alliance.

Bitter Boris denounces rival Michael Gove as 'deeply Machiavellian and flawed' and claims the former justice secretary's henchman stole his phone to scupper his PM bid.

Bitter Boris Johnson has denounced Michael Gove as 'deeply Machiavellian and flawed' for the way he knifed him in the Tory leadership contest.

And he has accused Gove's henchman, Tory MP Nick Boles, of 'stealing' his phone to sabotage his attempt to team up with leadership rival Andrea Leadsom.

In the first major revelations since their leadership fallout, allies of Johnson say he will never forgive Gove and Boles for the brutal way they killed off his dream of becoming Prime Minister in July.

Johnson had to abandon his bid after Gove, who had promised to back his Brexit ally, mounted his own last-minute leadership bid – without telling Johnson.

The former London Mayor has refused to comment publicly on Gove's betrayal, but the Mail On Sunday has established that he has told friends: 'The trouble with Michael is he is deeply Machiavellian and a flawed character.'

Johnson and his team have also vented their fury with 'double agent' Boles. Johnson's right-hand man, Tory MP Nigel Adams, called Boles a 'c*** in a Commons tea-room outburst and vowed: 'I'd like to nail the b****** against the wall and give him a good kicking.' Johnson is said to be livid at learning of the full extent of Boles's 'duplicity' when his vital plan to win Leadsom's backing collapsed hours before he was due to launch his campaign.

Johnson and Leadsom agreed to exchange texts at 8pm confirming the deal. Instead, she launched her own bid and Gove used it to justify following suit – forcing Johnson to pull out. Sources close to Johnson revealed he has since spoken to Leadsom to ask what went wrong.

'Andrea told him she texted him but he never replied, so she assumed the deal was off and she declared her own bid,' said one source. 'Boris said, 'But I never got it, Andrea.' Then it dawned on him. 'Of course! Boles had my phone! Boles!'

'His jaw hit the floor. He suddenly realised how Nick did the dirty on him. Andrea found her text message and read it out to him.' Johnson had spent the evening at a Tory ball at London's Hurlingham Club, chaperoned by Boles, whom he wrongly assumed was loyal.

Boles, who knew about the Leadsom deal, had volunteered to 'look after' Johnson's phone so he had 'no distractions'. Boles was also tasked with giving Leadsom a letter from Boris confirming the deal. She never got it.

Boles took unsuspecting Johnson home at around midnight – then went to Gove's house to finalise his secret leadership bid, knifing hapless Johnson. Friends of Johnson say Boles's treachery went further than 'stealing' his phone.

One said: 'Gove's lot said he had to run because Boris was disorganised and Boles was shocked to find he hadn't started his leadership speech by midnight the day before the launch. It was a con. We set six hours free earlier in the afternoon for him to do it but Boles and co kept distracting him.

'Now we know why: to give them a bogus excuse to betray him.'

Gove has since admitted he was wrong to betray Johnson. By contrast, tetchy Boles last week threatened to walk out of a BBC interview when quizzed about his conduct.

Before the BBC clash, he snapped at this newspaper: 'I have nothing to say. You are just trying to make me angry.'

Boles's role has also been questioned by some of Gove's supporters. They say Boles justified Gove's actions by saying he was 'only doing what William Hague did in 1997 when he saved the Tories from being led by Michael Howard' – referring to the way Hague initially backed Howard, then changed his mind and ran his own successful leadership campaign. Howard later became leader in 2003.

One Gove ally said: 'Michael's treachery to Boris was on a totally different scale and we all knew it.'

When Gove's campaign ended in disaster, Johnson's campaign chief and friend, Australian polling guru Lynton Crosby, consoled him: 'It serves Gove right. He shot you in the back through his own foot.'

This newspaper revealed last week how Gove was 'blackballed' by the exclusive Beefsteak gentlemen's club in London following a protest by Boris's father, Stanley, a Beefsteak committee member.

'Pfff!': ANNA SOUBRY asks if that was the EU's splutter of contempt... or the sound of UK's Brexit economy tanking?

I’m sure it wasn’t personal, but the television images from Theresa May’s first EU summit left little room for doubt about the size of the Brexit task that faces her. At the mere mention of her name, the reaction of EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker was a totally contemptuous and discourteous: ‘Pfff!’

Even Angela Merkel – who unlike Mr Juncker is not subject to drinking-cognac-for-breakfast claims, or known for emotional displays at any time of the day – said the Brexit talks would be ‘rough going’ for Britain.

Far from giving Mrs May a warm embrace on her first 100 days in office, the 27 other EU nations gave her the collective cold shoulder. She was given five minutes at 1am to set out her Brexit stall and was heard in silence.

Yes, five minutes at 1am. And let’s be honest, we shouldn’t be surprised.

We’ve been slagging off the EU for decades and now we’ve gone and voted to leave. And if anyone thinks they are going to offer us some great trade deal as we walk away, they are living in la la land.

Look at what they have done to the poor Canadians. Few have a bad word to say about Canada, but their trade minister Chrystia Freeland left Brussels in tears after their trade deal with the EU was wrecked by Wallonia, a small region of Belgium, because the Walloons objected to the small print in the deal. A dejected Ms Freeland said: ‘The EU is incapable of reaching an international agreement even with a country like Canada that has European values and patience. We have decided to return home. It’s a very sad day.’

As Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat observed: ‘If there are all these problems to have a trade agreement with Canada, imagine an agreement with the UK.’ Precisely. Imagine it.

It’s the stuff of madness to think the EU needs us more than we need them, and they could not have made it clearer to Mrs May at the summit.

Rolls-Royce is deeply worried by Brexit. Engine components move between the UK and other EU countries free of tariffs and red tape before coming back to Derby

My worst fears about the huge problems in Britain getting a good post-Brexit deal with the EU were borne out when I visited Rolls-Royce in Derby on Friday. I met brilliant young apprentices and highly skilled local workers making the finest jet engines in the world.

Rolls-Royce is deeply worried by Brexit. Engine components move between the UK and other EU countries free of tariffs and red tape before coming back to Derby. Our aerospace industry is a British success story which relies on Airbus – a collaboration with other EU countries. Rolls-Royce employs 23,000 workers in Britain, with thousands more in the supply chain, meaning it accounts for one in every 250 UK jobs.

It needs its British workers to move freely throughout the EU. Not surprisingly, it has raised concerns with the Chancellor, Philip Hammond. Thankfully, Hammond is one powerful voice of reason in the Cabinet.

Unlike some Ministers, full of Brexit zeal who seem to know little of the realities of business life, Hammond has a highly successful background in the private sector. He is calm, clear-headed and clever, and is making the case in Government that we must be realistic in our approach to Brexit and not rely on blind faith.

Judging from the hostile briefings against him in the media, it seems that No 10 is out to isolate or intimidate him.

I was shocked to learn that he was not informed in advance of Mrs May’s Conservative Party conference speech in which she criticised the governor of the Bank of England. Hammond has a right to be treated better than that. His exclusion from crucial Downing Street meetings is similarly worrying.

Instead of turning their attack dogs on our business-minded Chancellor, No 10 needs to put him at the heart of the Brexit negotiations, reject ideology, and put our country’s economy first.

Representatives of our manufacturing sector tell me that, in private discussions, Brexit Ministers are all too ready to wave away their concerns, insisting everything is going to be fine when we leave the EU. Well it isn’t. As EU leaders made clear to Mrs May, when she triggers Article 50, guaranteeing we leave the EU two years afterwards, not only will we be out of the EU with no way back, it is increasingly clear it will be on their terms, not ours.

For all the brave talk of Brexiteers that the EU needs us more than we need them, the reality is that they hold all the cards and they are going to punish us for leaving.

My worry is that when we do leave, the effect on the British economy will be rather like Mr Juncker’s reaction on being asked about Mrs May: ‘Pfff!’

Shut it! Civil servants are told to use sign language to get loud-mouthed ministers to be quiet during meetings

Loud-mouthed Ministers are facing a fightback from civil servants, who are being encouraged to use sign language to tell them to shut up.

Under a new Whitehall scheme, if someone is talking too much in a meeting, a ‘less dominant’ participant can raise their hand to silence them.

The signs have been created by officials at the Government Digital Service, who posted their findings on the Cabinet Office website

Alarmingly, experts say the 'clarify' signal is similar to the sign language gesture for female genitalia

The ‘shut it’ signal is one of six gestures.

Others include a C shape for ‘clarify’, downward-pointing hands to indicate disagreement, and a triangle sign to make a point of order.

Alarmingly, experts say that signal is similar to the sign language gesture for female genitalia.

The signs have been created by officials at the Government Digital Service, who posted their findings on the Cabinet Office website.

They said: ‘Using hand signals… can be a useful way to build up confidence.’
