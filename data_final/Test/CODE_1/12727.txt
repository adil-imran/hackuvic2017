U.S. presidential candidate Ted Cruz has claimed that Australia's 1996 firearms buyback led to a significant increase in sexual assaults on women - as the debate about gun control takes centre place in the race for the White House.

Republican Senator Cruz, who is vying to win the top job, made the comments during an interview with American radio host Hugh Hewitt on January 12.

'And as you know, Hugh, after Australia did that, the rate of sexual assaults, the rate of rapes, went up significantly, because women were unable to defend themselves,' Cruz told the conservative radio host.

'Women were unable to defend themselves,' Cruz incorrectly told a conservative radio host.

However, a subsequent analysis by the Washington Post's Fact Checker column, which measures the factual accuracy of political figures' comments, rated Cruz's claim a 'whopper' -- the paper's worst rating on its Pinocchio Test.

The John Howard government implemented sweeping gun reform in response to the 1996 Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania, in which Martin Bryant killed 35 people.

The 1996 National Firearms Agreement led to the buyback of 650,000 guns in a few months and stricter controls on licensing and ownership, especially of automatic and semi-automatic weapons.

The Washington Post found there was no 'significant spike' in sexual assaults after the buybacks and described the senator's statements as a 'false characterization'.

It attributed a gradual increase in sexual assaults between 1996 and 2014 to increased reporting.

It also said there wasn't prevalent use of handguns for self-defense before 1996.

The paper's analysis drew on a range of data, including reports by the Australian Institute of Criminology and the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

It also interviewed Samara McPhedran, senior research fellow at Griffith University in Australia and chair of the International Coalition of Women in Shooting and Hunting.

Gun control has been thrust into the centre of the 2016 presidential race, following a tearful condemnation of gun violence by President Barack Obama earlier this month.

Obama announced plans to tighten gun control through a number of executive actions, which have been attacked by Republican front runners Senator Cruz, Jeb Bush and Donald Trump.
