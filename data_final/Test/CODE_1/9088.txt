The Iraqi Yazidi and Yazidism Religion, Who and what is it? - Documentaries Video duration : 52:17

Video uploaded by : Documentaries

Video release date : Jan 29th, 2015 The Iraqi Yazidi and Yazidism Religion - Documentaries The Yazidis, also Yezidi, Ezidi or Yazdani, are a Kurdish ethnoreligious group. They live largely in the Nineveh Province of Iraq. Additional communities in Armenia, Georgia, and Syria have been in decline since the 1990s as an outcome of significant migration to Europe, especially to Germany. Their syncretic religion, known as Yazidism and qualified by Mehrdad Izady as a sort of Yazdanism, has links to Zoroastrianism and ancient Mesopotamian faiths. Yazidis are monotheists, believing in God as developer of the world, which he has put under the treatment of seven divine beings or angels, the chief of whom is Melek Taus, the Peacock Angel, who, as world-ruler, induces both bad and great to befall individuals, an ambivalence reflected in myths of his own temporary fall from God's support, before his remorseful splits snuffed out the fires of his hellish prison and he was reconciled with God. They venerate Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir whose shrine goes to Lalish.

Yezidi Girl's Speech at UN Security Council about horrors of ISIS captivity Video duration : 09:52

Video uploaded by : R&U Videos

Video release date : Dec 21st, 2015 Islamic State militants consider the Yazidis to be devil-worshippers. The Yazidi faith has elements of Christianity, Zoroastrianism and Islam. Most of the Yazidi population, numbering around half a million, remains displaced in camps inside the autonomous entity in Iraq's north known as Kurdistan. Of around 5,000 Yazidi men and women captured by the militants in the summer of 2014, some 2,000 have managed to escape or been smuggled out of Islamic State's self-proclaimed caliphate, activists say. The rest remain in captivity. A young Yazidi woman pleaded (on December 16th 2015) for the United Nations Security Council to wipe out Islamic State after describing the torture and rape she suffered at hands of the militants, who abducted her as "war booty" and held her for three months.

Nineteen Yazidi Women Burned Alive for Refusing Sex With Islamic State Militants Video duration : 01:11

Video uploaded by : Wochit News

Video release date : Jun 6th, 2016 Last week, nineteen Yazidi women were burned alive for refusing to have sex with ISIS militants. The Kurdish ARA News broke the story, saying that the women were thrown into iron cages and burned alive as people were forced to watch. According to India Today, over the last two years Islamic State fighters have killed, raped, and enslaved thousands of Yazidis. So far, 400,000 of the small religious minority have fled their homes in Northern Iraq, fearing persecution from the Islamic State. The Yazidi faith blends elements of Christianity, Zoroastrianism and Islam. The United Nations says that Yazidiz are not alone, since the Sunni militants enslaved about 7,000 women and girls in 2014, mainly Yazidis. Islamic Strate is still holding approximately 3,500, some as sex slaves. http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/yazidi-women-burnt-alive-isis-sex-slaves/1/685303.html http://www.wochit.com This video was produced by YT Wochit News using http://wochit.com Video views : 1,021
