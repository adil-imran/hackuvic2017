Opposition leader Raila Odinga's ODM party unity was thrown into doubt following the resignation of Secretary-General Ababu Namwamba.

Namwamba, who has held the position for slightly over two years since the abortive 2014 party polls, announced Wednesday that he was resigning from the post, one of the powerful in the party hierarchy.

The development suggests attempts by the party to heal the rift created by a rebellion by Western ODM MPs had collapsed, as four days earlier Funyula MP Paul Otuoma had, too, quit as national vice chairman.

A meeting chaired by Raila last week had given dissenters two weeks to file their grievances, which were to be mediated through party structures but the action by Namwamba and Otuoma has escalated the power struggle in the party.

Although the two have insisted that they are still ODM members, avoiding renouncing the party like rebel Kilifi North MP Gideon Mung'aro did, party stalwarts believe it is just a matter of time before they jump ship.

The timing of the instability in ODM complicates matters for the party because it signals more trouble in its Western stronghold, 14 months to the General Election and distracts it from the mission to rebuild a credible team to face rivals.

The upheaval comes also on the back of a tussle between ODM and its partners in the CORD coalition, Wiper and Ford Kenya, for the alliance's presidential ticket that Raila, Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang'ula are vying for.

Wednesday, Namwamba made the announcement in Mundere in his Budalang'i Constituency during a meeting with party delegates, religious leaders, elders and professionals from the area.

"Today I officially resign as ODM secretary general. I have gone through a lot of suffering in ODM. If you disrespect Ababu, that means you have disrespected my electorate who are my employer," noted the Budalang'i lawmaker.

He, however, did not give any indication of leaving the party, which followed the script earlier written by Otuoma who on Saturday also maintained that he was still in ODM.

Namwamba said his decision to quit was triggered by frustrations that he has been facing in the party.

He disclosed that his woes started when he expressed interest to vie for the secretary general's post in 2013.
