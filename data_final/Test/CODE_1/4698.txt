MPs to consider sweeping reforms to murder laws for first time in decades

MPs are to review Britain's murder laws in a debate that could eventually mean the end of automatic life sentences for murderers.

Backbench politicians will examine whether American-style first or second degree classifications could be introduced to UK courts.

The intent would be to draw a distinction between the worst planned murders and other killings, such as resulting from a fight.

Tory MP and barrister Alex Chalk has called for reforms to murder laws that would end automatic life sentences in some cases

British law has mandated a life sentence for murderers since 1957 when the Homicide Act was passed as part of the deal to end the death penalty in the UK.

The Law Commission has already recommended reforms.

The Justice Select Committee will hold an evidence session on the debate next week, The Times revealed today.

Alex Chalk, a Conservative MP, barrister and member of the committee, raised the issue in Parliament.

He told a Westminster Hall debate: 'We need an offence of first-degree murder that would encompass intentional killing only.

'An offence of first degree murder would simply and coherently communicate to the public the particularly heinous nature of the crime of taking life and would attract the special condemnation and opprobrium that that deserves.'

He added: 'Under my proposal, second degree murder would encompass killing through an intention to do injury that is more than merely transient or trifling. In plain English: it would encompass killing through unacceptable violence and thuggery.

'That would include the colonel and the pub queue thugâ€”people who committed a significant assault on others but who did not intend to kill.

'That category of offence would not require a mandatory life sentence. Instead, judges would be free to do justice, weighing in the balance all of the aggravating and mitigating factors.'

Many murders committed in England and Wales are tried at the Central Criminal Court of the Old Bailey in London (file picture)

Another Tory MP and barrister Victoria Prentis told the same debate: 'I am in no way belittling the crushing effect of murder on the families of the victims.

'However, those sort of crimes... are very different from the pre-meditated, sadistic murders carried out by psychopaths which passed my desk.

'It is important that the law recognises that.'

Justice Minister Oliver Heald will give evidence to the justice committee on murder laws when it meets next week.

A change to the law would require a lengthy legislative process in Parliament and is effectively impossible if the Government refused to engage with the debate and support new laws.
