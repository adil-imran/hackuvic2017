Our preoccupation with Brexit, the ascendancy of Theresa May and the travails of Labour have drawn the focus away from international news.

MPs will today try to correct that imbalance with a three-hour emergency debate on Syria.

Some will say this is a futile gesture given Putin and Assad’s indifference to international rules and opinion.

While such cynicism is understandable it is misplaced.

The suffering in Aleppo should shame the world.

Innocents are being brutally killed and maimed on a daily basis and it is right that MPs, even if powerless to stop it at this moment, should seek to keep their plight in the spotlight and explore ways of ending the five-year civil war.

Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell and his Labour colleagues John Woodcock and Alison McGovern, to name a few, deserve credit for securing the debate.

In an article for Monday’s Mirror , Mitchell compared Putin’s shredding of international protocols to the way Germany and Italy undermined the authority of the League of Nations ahead of the Second World War.

There are parallels, he noted, between Aleppo and the Nazi bombing of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War.

In Parliament today we have Health Questions where Jeremy Hunt will face his new shadow Jonathan Ashworth for the first time.

Expect Mr Hunt to face questions about NHS staffing, the dire state of the NHS finances and the crisis in social care.

The Business select committee is holding an intriguing session today on industrial strategy where George Osborne, Michael Heseltine and Vince Cable will give evidence.

There is much common ground between Heseltine and Cable on the role of the state in stimulating regional economies that echoes the change in emphasis from the May administration.

Will Mr Osborne use the opportunity to endorse the change of direction under Theresa May or offer a different path?

Labour MP Conor McGinn will use a ten-minute rule bill today to introduce a Helen’s Law .

This will call for the Government to deny parole to killers who refuse to reveal the location of their victims’ bodies.

The law is inspired by Marie McCourt in memory of her daughter Helen, who was killed in 1988 by pub landlord Ian Simms.

The 22-year-old’s body has never been found.
