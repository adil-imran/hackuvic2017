Reacting to a query on Maoist activities in the state, the Police Chief said, "Maoist activities have come down to a large extent in the state. However, the ultras come in from neighbouring states into and we are alert and search parties are patrolling the areas in Khammam, Karimnagar and Adilabad districts bordering neighbouring states."



"Anything that is democratic is welcome...But, persons who do not believe in democracy and democratic ways we also cannot tolerate that," he warned.



Reacting to another query, the DGP said, "We do not support anybody (in police force) who is corrupt and who misbehaves...Wherever such cases have come to our notice we have taken stringent action. We do not tolerate any corruption."



A delegation led by Sharma had recently visited the UK and the US to study the best practises being adopted by the police there.



"We conducted a study tour and focus was on technology usage by police," the DGP said adding that a report will be submitted to the government in this regard.
