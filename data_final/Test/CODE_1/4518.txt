A man was arrested late Monday night after police launched a manhunt following the gruesome discovery of the bodies of a married couple in Prey Veng province on Sunday morning, who had both been stabbed through the eyes.



Kanh Chriech commune police chief Pun Samoun said yesterday that 28-year-old Chhay Heng, also known as Chhay Tung, was arrested on Monday.



“I suspected it was him since before the victims’ funeral, because he didn’t look at me when he saw me and always quickly left,” he told Khmer Times. “Moreover, the suspect did not attend the victims’ funeral and claimed that he felt unwell after he drank too much alcohol.



“These actions made us suspicious and so we began investigating and we eventually called him for questioning at the police station.”



Under questioning, Mr. Heng confessed that he had killed 48-year-old Kak Bunthan and her husband Mean Yorn, 43, over a long-standing grudge he held against Ms. Bunthan. The two men had been frequent drinking partners, Mr. Samoun explained, and Ms. Bunthan had apparently tried to stop Mr. Heng from calling on the house to drink with her husband.



Mr. Samoun described how Mr. Heng had told police he had followed the couple after they left their house to collect crabs, snails and fish in the rice fields, some 800 meters behind the village.



Ms. Bunthan, who was walking apart from her husband, was the first to be killed, Mr. Heng told police, and he then killed Mr. Yorn after her screams had attracted her husband.



While police reports on Monday mentioned that both victims had been stabbed in the eyes and elsewhere on their faces, Mr. Samoun said that Mr. Heng had only mentioned drowning the pair.



He added that the suspect was under detention at the Kanh Chriech district police station yesterday, while the paperwork was prepared to send him to provincial police for court processing.



According to a National Police report, the couple was murdered at about 9pm on Saturday, with their swollen bodies found in flooded rice fields the next morning. The report said that police had questioned six people over the murder, including Mr. Heng’s wife and mother-in-law.



Scratch marks on Mr. Heng’s body, believed to have been caused during the murders, led police to arrest him, the report added.
