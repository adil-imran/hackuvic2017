"There is a need the OSCE Minsk group co-chairs to bring Armenian leadership to peace and constructive negotiation process. We share and highly appreciate the statement of the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov who said there is no reason to be concerned about the discussion of the draft law on recognition by Armenia of the illegal regime in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan", the spokesman of Azerbaijan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Hikmet Hajiyev said.

"Azerbaijani side has always stated its readiness for progress in the talks and in substantive negotiations and on this basis the outcome meetings which will result in the liberation of Azerbaijani territories," Hikmet Hajiyev added.

Hajiyev said that Azerbaijani civilian population who live near the line of contact suffer from violation of the ceasefire by the Armenian side. "There are no civilians in the Armenian-controlled part of the line of contact in the occupied territories as a result of ethnic cleansing by Armenia against the Azerbaijani population. Establishing a mechanism to prevent ceasefire violations and investigate incidents should be an integral part of the process of the withdrawal of Armenian troops from the occupied Azerbaijani territories," he said.

"The road map to resolve the conflict is known. Armenia itself is well aware of the fact that in the framework of conflict resolution process the withdrawal of Armenian troops from the occupied Azerbaijani territories must be ensured," Hajiyev added.
