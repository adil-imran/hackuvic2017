It was a bloody day in parts of the country yesterday. Nigerian Medical Association, NMA, lost six leaders of its Ekiti State chapter to a deadly road crash.

In Enugu State, Fulani herdsmen unleashed mayhem on Ukpabi community, killing scores of people, while cultists also massacred 13 people in Kogi State. The accident, which claimed the lives of the NMA members and their driver, involved a 13-passenger bus belonging to the state branch of NMA a few kilometres to Kaduna. The deceased were heading to Sokoto State for NMA’s National Officers Committee meeting, according to a statement signed by its President and Secretary-General, Kayode Obembe and Adewunmi Alayaki. The statement gave the names of the deceased as Dr. Alex Akinyele of the Federal Teaching Hospital, FETHI, Ido Ekiti, who is also secretary of NMA Ekiti State, Dr. Tunde Aladesanmi, General Surgeon, FETHI, Ido Ekiti; Dr. O.J. Taiwo, Anatomic Pathologist, Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital, EKSUTH, Ado-Ekiti; Dr. Ogunseye J.B of the National Association of General and Government Medical and Dental Practitioners, NAGGMDP, and also National Secretary, Hospital Management Board, HMB, Ekiti.

“The bereaved families have been contacted and arrangements are in motion to convey the bodies back to Ekiti State. “NOC has sent its representatives to Kaduna for on the spot assessment and compliment the effort of the Kaduna team. “While the conference continues, the NOC hereby directs that all doctors should observe one week of mourning from Tuesday 26th to Tuesday 3rd of May, 2016. Every doctor should put on Black band on the left arm over white overall. “NMA is in contact with the bereaved families and burial arrangements will be communicated in due course,” the association said. In Ekiti State, medical practitioners were in sober mood yesterday following the death of the six doctors. Activities were paralysed in the tertiary, secondary and primary healthcare facilities just as the mood of the health personnel became gloomier as the identities of the victims were revealed. Flags were flown at half mast, following declaration of three-day mourning by the state government. While workers in EKSUTH, were seen discussing the sad incident in groups, their counterparts in FETHI barricaded the gates to protest the death of the doctors. FETHI Chief Medical Director, CMD, Dr Lawrence Ayodele, described the death as a national disaster.

“It is not about the state, but the whole country because it involves six senior doctors and a driver,” he said. Ayodele, who said it could be usual to see certain behaviour in time of grief, appealed to the workers not to allow emotion to override their thinking. The CMD said families of the deceased had been contacted by both the state government and the NMA over the ugly incident. EKSUTH CMD, Dr Kolawole Ogundipe, said management had sent five ambulances to Kaduna to evacuate the corpses of the deceased. Ogundipe appealed to members to be peaceful, even as he prayed that God would grant NMA, families of the deceased and Ekiti State government fortitude to bear the loss.In Enugu State, Ukpabi community in Nimbo, Uzo-Uwani Local Government Area was a shadow of its former self yesterday following the invasion of the area by Fulani herdsmen. The herdsmen, who sources said were armed with dangerous weapons, stormed the town in their numbers, shooting any person in sight. Although details of the attack were still sketchy, a source disclosed that survivors had fled to neighbouring communities of Nkpologu, Uvuru and Nsukka.

“Nobody is left in our community; those who survived the attack have relocated to neighbouring communities. “They came destroying our buildings, killing and maiming people with their guns and machetes. “As they are killing and injuring people, they are also setting houses and vehicles ablaze; many people have been killed, I do not have the actual number now. “Some of the dead have been deposited at the Bishop Shanahan Hospital mortuary in Nsukka,” the source said. Our correspondent learnt that residents of Nsukka wept uncontrollably when the bodies of the victims were being deposited at the Bishop Shanahan Hospital. A resident, Mr Dennis Ezema, urged the Federal Government to urgently intervene in the activities of the herdsmen before it escalated to a full blown war. “It is unfortunate that people can be mercilessly killed without human feeling. “You can see how these people were killed and sliced like bread; people should respect the sanctity of human life,” he said. Police Public Relations Officer in Enugu State, Ebere Amaraizu, who confirmed the incident, said the State Police Commissioner, Mr. Nwodibo Ekechukwu, had already moved to Uzo-Uwani to ensure that normalcy was returned.

“Yes the police is aware of the attack in Uzo-Uwani and the police commissioner is already there to ensure that the situation was brought under control. “Police is collaborating with sister security agencies like the army, civil defense, the Department of State Service to handle the situation,” he said. Chairman of Uzo-Uwani Local Government, Mr. Cornell Onwubuya, who also confirmed the incident, regretted that in spite of efforts to stop the crisis through dialogue, the suspected herdsmen had continued to attack the people. “Yes, there is serious problem in the local government as suspected herdsmen today attacked Nimbo community. “Information reaching us said many people were killed but I do not know the actual number now,” he said. Tension had started mounting in the town over the weekend, when reports spread that herds National invade the community and displace residents for cattle-grazing. It was gathered that herdsmen at Adani had, weekend, imported 500 others from Nasarawa State to help them invade the community on grounds that some of their cattle were missing. Consequently, Onwubuya, had on Saturday convened an emergency meeting in Enugu. Onwubuya said the meeting was convened to address the allegation that herdsmen planned to import about 500 of their tribesmen to enable them invade some communities in the area. Meanwhile, 13 persons have reportedly been killed by suspected cultists in Adah, Kogi State.

The cultists were said to have gone on rampage following alleged killing of a member, Danjuma Amodu also known as (Murphy) by another rival cult group. Amodu was allegedly shot dead while relaxing in front of his family home at GRA, Idah. It was gathered that reprisal attack by suspected gunmen, who came in a Volkswagen Gulf held the town hostage for hours. The sporadic and indiscriminate shooting led to the killing of 13 persons, while several others sustained injuries. “The gunmen blocked the road between Ibro junction and Bishop Road junction between the hours of 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. from where they proceeded to a drinking joint at Igalaogba in search of their possible targets,” a source said. The owner of the joint, Haruna Achema and his wife were reportedly shot, while a customer was killed instantly. Military personnel have, however, been on patrol in the city since the incidence. State Police Commissioner, Yakubu Usman said the suspected cultists shot a 27year old man at Anyigba- Idah road and the corpse was taken to the police station.

He said one of his men sustained bullet wounds during a gun battle with the group. He also said that as the gunmen were running away after a gun duel with his men, they also hit three innocent persons, who were rushed to hospital. The commissioner stated that his men were still on the trail of the suspected cultists, adding that they would be arrested soon.
