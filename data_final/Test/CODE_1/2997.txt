UPDATE @ 12:39 p.m.

Springfield police are trying to determine if the driver in a fatal hit and run crash purposefully went off the roadway to strike the victims.

The person of interest in the Springfield fatal hit and run is in jail on separate charges.

Jeffrey Campbell was arrested for spitting on a Springfield police officer early Friday morning as they tried to bring him in for questioning on a crash that left another man dead, according to a Springfield Police Division report.

Phillip Carlton, 41, was struck as he stood on a concrete median at the corner of South Shaffer and Court streets Friday morning about 1 a.m., said Sgt. Brett Bauer.

Tips about a suspect vehicle led police to the Night Owl bar on West Main Street where the vehicle was located, along with Campbell.

When officers tried to take Campbell in for questioning, he spit on them, Bauer said.

Police are still investigating the fatal crash, Bauer said, with two separate angles: a traffic crash but also a criminal offense of whether the driver purposefully struck the victim.

No charges related to the crash have been filed.

Campbell did not appear in a Clark County Municipal Court arraignment Friday morning because he was being uncooperative, according to court records.

But a judge set his bond at $5,000 and rescheduled his appearance for Nov. 8.

UPDATE @ 6:35 a.m.

Springfield police confirmed a person of interest in a fatal pedestrian crash is in custody, following an arrest for a separate charge.

The man, identified at 53-year-old Jeffrey Campbell was arrested behind the Nite Owl Bar after he spit in an officer’s face and led police on a brief foot chase, according to dispatchers.

Campbell was charged with harassment of bodily fluids and was booked into the Clark County Jail.

He is not facing any charges related to the crash yet, but is considered a person of interest.

We’ll update this page when new details are available.
