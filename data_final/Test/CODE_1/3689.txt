"We welcome the remarks that Prime Minister of India made on the human rights violations in Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Kashmir and Balochistan.

"People of Balochistan,Gilgit and PoK have thanked me a lot in past few days, I am grateful to them," he said in New Delhi on the occasion of's 70th Independence Day.

"This is the example of our humanitarian approach, but there are some countries who glorify terrorists. To the youth who have taken up guns, I urge them to return to their parents and shun violence," he added.

Earlier on Saturday, two prominent Baloch leaders welcomed Prime Minister Modi's stand to expose Pakistan's brutalities inand Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

Their appeal came a day after the Modi government launched a fresh offensive against Islamabad for igniting the latest unrest in Kashmir after the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani last month.

Kashmir has been on the boil for more than a month with at least 58 killed and thousands wounded during protests against Wani's killing. ( ANI
