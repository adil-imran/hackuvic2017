On Friday’s Mark Levin show, There is no defending what Donald Trump said about women in 2005; it was grotesque. The media dumping this on Friday in order to take advantage of it before the upcoming, Sunday debate is unethical. Where was this media when President Bill Clinton was accused of assaulting multiple women? Where was this media when Hillary Clinton led the smear machine in defense of her husband? This media was silent because they are the Praetorian Guard of statism. They’re for big government. They’re for the Democrats and they reject us, they despise us. They don’t report. In addition, the business of being an outsider does not excuse any of Trump’s conduct. However, the goal is to beat Hillary Clinton, not defend the indefensible. After that, 54% of people who entered the U.S. in 2015 illegally were caught. What happened to the other 46%? Later, Planned Parenthood is a private organization, so why should the American taxpayer keep funding it? Planned Parenthood is immune to budgetary cuts despite its disgusting activities. They are fighting to ensure that we keep funding it against our wishes. Finally, weatherman, Joe Bastardi of WeatherBell calls in to give us an update on Hurricane Matthew.
