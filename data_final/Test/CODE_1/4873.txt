Now Ms Ayliffe-Chung's mother, Rosie Ayliffe, is in Australia as she prepares for the funeral of her only child - which will be held in Surfer's Paradise on Friday.

She has spoken about both Mr Jackson and her daughter's alleged killer, Frenchmen Smail Ayad, 29.

'I feel pity for him because he now has to live knowing he's killed two strong, exceptional people,' she said of Mr Ayad.

She wants to meet Thomas Jackson's family.

'He's an incredible young man, there's no two ways about it,' Ms Ayliffe said.

'It was an act of exceptional bravery.'

Ms Ayliffe is not the only person who feels Mr Jackson's actions showed bravery,

Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has nominated him for a posthumous award after his efforts during the knife attack.

'Tom Jackson's actions of putting his own life before the life of Ms Ayliffe-Chung is an extraordinary act of courage & deserves recognition,' Ms Palaszczuk wrote.

Rosie Ayliffe has also expressed desire to meet Thomas Jackson's family after he died trying to save her daughter's life

'That's why I have today written to the Australian Bravery Decorations Council to nominate Mr Jackson for a posthumous bravery award.'

The nomination came on Wednesday, two days after Mr Jackson's life support was turned off and was announced over Twitter.

On Monday Mr Jackson's father Les, 58, said the family had been left 'bereft' with the passing of their charity worker son.

Hero: Thomas Jackson has been nominated for a post humous bravery award after he tried to save fellow backpacker Mia Ayliffe-Chung after she was stabbed

The kickboxer screamed 'Allahu Akbar', Arabic for 'God is great', while stabbing her, say witnesses, and hurt 12 police officers who used pepper spray and a taser to subdue him.

Despite his jihadi-style outburst, police have ruled out links to terrorism, and say tests found he had been using cannabis.

Mr Jackson family turned off his life-support machine at Townsville Hospital, Queensland on Monday morning.

His father who had flown 10,000 miles from the family home in Congleton, Cheshire, said: 'We are bereft. Our darling Tom has left us and the world is a poorer place.

'Thanks again to everyone for the love and support you have given us over the last few days, we will be forever grateful.

'There is dark and evil in this world perpetrated by a few, but so much more love and light emanates from so many more. That thought will sustain us.'

In a Facebook message, Mr Jackson's younger sister Olivia, 23, urged people not to remember her brother as a victim, saying: 'To everyone back home and everyone here, there are literally not enough words to thank you for your support. All I ask is that you don't remember Tom as a victim. You remember him as a friend, cherish the memories you had together and be thankful you got to meet him.'

A Youcaring fundraising page has set up to help the family. The page has raised more than £1,300 of a £5,000 target with all donations going to Mr Jackson's parents.

Last week he said: 'There are many and varied reasons why we are, and always will be, immensely proud of Tom.

'His actions in response to this horrific attack only add to that sense of pride'.

Mr Jackson's sister, Liv, wrote on Facebook: 'Today it is with the heaviest of hearts that I have had to say goodbye to my wonderful big brother, Tom. There is nothing in this world that can prepare you for the pain and heartbreak of losing a sibling and a friend, but there is great comfort in knowing that he was mine.

'To everyone back home and to everyone here in Australia, there are literally not enough words to thank you for your support and beautifully kind words to my family at this time. All that I ask is that you don't remember Tom as a victim. You remember him as a friend, cherish the memories you had together and be thankful you got to meet him and be part of the joy that he bought to this world.

'Indescribably proud of everything you accomplished and the lives you touched. I will love you always and forever TJ, your little sister, Lou.'

Frenchman Smail Ayad, 29, was charged with one count of murder, two counts of attempted murder, one count of serious animal cruelty and twelve counts of serious assault.

Friend Rachel Eddie Edwards posted: 'I keep praying it's not real as I can't really find the words to say how devastated I am to lose one of my greatest and longest friends.

'The world has lost a hero. I will never ever forget how much of an incredible person you are Jacko and how you lit up my life whenever we've been together or even on our many phone calls. You can Rest In Peace now my dear friend ... I'm going to miss you terribly.'

Mr Jackson was a sport student at South Cheshire College until 2005.

'Our hearts go out to Thomas's family and friends following this tragic incident.'

Miss Ayliffe-Chung was allegedly dragged from her bed by Ayad while she slept in the dormitory they shared on an Australian farm

Ms Ayliffe-Chung and Mr Jackson were killed at Shelley's Backpackers in Home Hill, Queensland. It is a popular place for backpackers to stay doing rural work to fulfil visa requirements

Police allege Mr Ayad screamed 'Allahu Akbar' - Arabic for 'God is great' - during the attack.

Smail Ayad, a 29-year-old Frenchman, has been charged with the murder of Ms Ayliffe-Chung, but has been deemed too violent by police to appear in court.

Miss Ayliffe-Chung was allegedly dragged from her bed by Ayad while she slept in the dormitory they shared on an Australian farm.

POLICE PRAISE FOR 'HERO' BACKPACKER TOM JACKSON Police described Mr Jackson's attempts to help Ms Ayliffe-Chung as 'completely selfless' last week. Superintendent Ray Rohweder said on Friday: 'There is no doubt he tried to render aid to Mia.' 'His subsequent actions were absolutely fantastic... 'I have no doubt that his actions on that day, as selfless, completely selfless as they were, led to the injuries that he now has.'

Writing in The Independent, her mother Rosie Ayliffe said: 'Having been raised as a socialist and within the Church, what I choose to take from the scriptures and from socialist texts is that forgiveness and reparation are absolutely key, or violence escalates into something uncontrollable.

'And the person who killed Mia now has to live with the fact that they destroyed my daughter. If they feel no remorse, then surely they're a monster in human form, and what kind of life is that?

'My brother asked me what I would do or say in a hypothetical world if I could meet Mia's killer.

'It appears he wasn't allowed to appear in court this week because of safety concerns, so I'm unlikely to get near enough to have a conversation, and only if I were suicidal would I want to (I'm not).'

Mr Ayad's case was adjourned to October 28.
