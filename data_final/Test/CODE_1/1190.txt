This is the terrifying moment that four men dressed in black allegedly attacked two British backpackers with a metal bar in Bangkok.

The group could be seen kicking and punching the tourists who were desperately fighting for their lives during the ordeal.

Locals tried to stop the men during their brutal attack on Khao San Road – a hotspot for backpackers.

It is thought that the beating started after one of the British men gave a middle finger to the men in black after a row outside a nightclub.

Two men have been arrested and charged after the 90-second smartphone clip was uploaded to social media on Sunday night.

Mirror Online has contacted the Foreign Office for comment.

It comes after British holidaymakers were warned to be on “high alert” over fears of more bombs rocking holiday spots across Thailand.

The alarm was sent out by the Foreign Office after a spate of 11 terror blasts rocked Thailand overnight on Thursday and Friday killing four and injuring dozens, including foreigners.

The bombings - caused by homemade devices - went off south of Bangkok and several hit the tourism industry.

The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office said yesterday there is now a “high threat” from terrorism in Thailand.

AN FCO statement added: “Bomb and grenade attacks have been indiscriminate, including in places visited by expatriates and foreign travellers.

“There have been attacks in the past in the main cities of Thailand, including in Bangkok in 2015 and 2012, in Koh Samui in 2015, and in Chiang Mai in 2010.”
