PanARMENIAN.Net - The 1994 and 1995 ceasefire agreement in Nagorno Karabakh continues serving as a basis for a possible armistice in the conflict zone, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Thursday, April 21.

“In view of the current situation in Nagorno Karabakh, the Russian side insists that the 1994 agreement on the ceasefire and the 1995 agreement on strengthening the ceasefire in Nagorno Karabakh are of unlimited duration," the ministry said, in particular.

According to the statement, this fundamental position was stressed in a note by Russia’s Permanent Mission to the OSCE, sent to Azerbaijan’s Permanent Mission on April 12.
