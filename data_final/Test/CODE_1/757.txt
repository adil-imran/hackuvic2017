Two communist rebel leaders yesterday warned that a plot to oust President Duterte by elements of the US government, the military and moneyed groups in the country could derail the success of the peace talks.

Speaking at a forum on the peace talks, Benito and Wilma Tiamzon warned that while the progress of the peace talks with the government under the Duterte administration looked bright, there was a need for vigilance against these “powerful forces” that might put up heavy resistance to it.

The Tiamzons, designated consultants of the National Democratic Front (NDF), the political arm of the Communist Party of the Philippines, which is engaged in the peace talks with the government, said the second round of peace negotiations in Oslo, Norway, next month will take up more crucial and challenging issues.

Leftist influence

Among the issues to be tackled are the proposed general amnesty for political prisoners and a ceasefire of the two parties.

“We know that even before President Duterte was elected, there were already elements of the US government and members of some influential groups who were planning to stop the Left’s influence on the government,” said Benito in Filipino.

He also said there were members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police continuing to campaign against the peace talks.

“Because of this situation, we are hopeful yet vigilant for sudden twists that might occur due to intensified friction between the political factions,” he said at a forum attended mostly by students and teachers in Pasig City.

Murder trial

The Tiamzons were temporarily released from detention last month to participate in the resumption of the peace negotiations in Oslo on Aug. 22. They were among 22 NDF consultants requested to be released by the communist group.

The Tiamzons, said to be ranking members of the CPP-NPA’s central committee, were arrested two years and five months ago and were detained at Camp Crame in Quezon City while on trial for multiple murder.
