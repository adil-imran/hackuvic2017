Pundits expect Clinton to do well in Virginia, a moderate swing-state with a diverse Democratic electorate, against Vermont Sen. "I also think she's the woman to be the first president of the United States that's a female", Reid, the most senior Democrat in the Senate, said in an exclusive interview to CNN.

Polls show Clinton has a pretty big lead with Hispanic voters in Texas, but Limon says he feels good about Sanders outreach efforts.

"This has been a turbulent political year, but the Florida Democratic primary looks like a blow-out", said Peter Brown, the poll's assistant director.

She left the attacks Thursday to Sen.

Clinton has received $$4,042,909 so far in campaign donations from people in the state, according to publicly available contribution data from the Federal Election Commission.

"I'm not up on all of them", she said.

Berne Sanders will continue his tour of historically black colleges and universities with a stop at Claflin University in Orangeburg.

What's the first word that comes to mind when Americans think of Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders?

"We're going to shock the world", McAuliffe told Clinton supporters at new campaign office in Richmond. No other issue cracks single digits. It has a margin of error of +-4.1% with 90% confidence.

In an RCP average against Bernie Sanders, Trump loses to the self-proclaimed socialist by an average of 6 points - a margin that is almost four points higher than the former secretary of state has against the GOP leader.

Later in the evening she paid a visit to a fundraising concert and declared "Let's make sure to get out and vote on Saturday!"

Brown also said 50% of the 600 likely primary voters in both polls said Rhode Island is on the wrong track.

In a recent CNN/ORC South Carolina poll of African-American voters, Clinton tallied 65% support compared to 28% for Sanders. Among self-identified Democrats, Clinton leads Sanders 55% to 31%, but among self-identified independents, Sanders leads Clinton 58% to 36%.

For many black voters, warm feelings about Clinton are tied to their affection for her husband.

Before a thousand people Thursday evening, Clinton recalled the June massacre by a white gunman who killed the pastor and eight others at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. As the visualization above shows, Sanders holds double-digit leads among those same age groups in the Palmetto State.

Public Policy Polling, which leans Democratic, surveyed 388 likely Democratic primary voters through automated telephone calls and over the Internet on February 24 and 25.
