THE HAGUE, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Syrian government forces backed by Russia are carrying out a deliberate policy of ethnic cleansing around the northern Syrian city of Aleppo, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Wednesday.

"One of the aims of the latest attacks is to conduct ethnic cleansing. Ethnic cleansing in Syria and Aleppo aimed at only leaving regime supporters behind is being conducted by the Syrian regime and Russia in a very deliberate way," he said.

"Every refugee that we accept helps their ethnic cleansing policy but we will continue to accept (refugees)," Davutoglu told a joint news conference with his Dutch counterpart.
