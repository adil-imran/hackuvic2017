Updated Feb. 18: A special Skype Q&A session with screenwriter and director Jamie Donoughhue has been added to Saturday's screening.

WORCESTER â€“ Clark University is offering you a chance to step inside the Kosovo War with a screening of the Oscar-nominated short film "Shok."

"This is a celebration of the great US-Albania relations and the anniversary of Kosovo's Independence, which would not have happened without the United States and NATO's help," organizer Deni Hoxha wrote in an email.

"Shok" is based on true events in the Kosovo War, which broke out between NATO and Serbia in 1998 to stop the ethnic cleansing of Albanians.

The critical reception for the short film has been significantly positive, with the Examiner describing it as "superb and shining." It is the first Albanian Oscar-nominated short film, according to its website.

Written and directed by Jamie Donoughue, the film looks at the lives of two 12-year-old boys after the war breaks out.

"The conflict fills the boys' existence with violence and fear, forcing them to make choices that threaten not only their community but their families too," a press release states.

"Shok" has been nominated for an Oscar for Best Short Film, Live Action. Since its release, it has also received 11 other awards, including the Audience Award, Jury Award and Youth Jury Prize at the 2015 Aspen Shortsfest, the Jury Award at the San Jose International Short Film Festival and the Silver Medal at the Manhattan Short Film Festival.

The film is 21 minutes long. It will be screened for Worcester audiences on Saturday, Feb. 20, at 6 p.m., at Jefferson 320, in the Jefferson Academic Center of Clark University. The screening is timed to celebrate the eighth anniversary of Kosovo's Independence on Feb. 17, 2008.
