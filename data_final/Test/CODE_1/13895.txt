(Mediaite) The Wall Street Journal ran a full-page ad Wednesday for a website that denies the Armenian genocide, an ethnic cleansing that left 1.5 million people dead.

“Truth = Peace,” the ad reads. A hand with the Turkish flag makes a peace sign, while two hands crossing their fingers have the Russian and Armenian flags on them. The ad directs readers to visit FactCheckArmenia.com to get the real story.
