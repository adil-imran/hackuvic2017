MANILA - A historian believes that past events should serve as a reminder for people, and not used as a weapon against former colonizers.

Speaking on ANC's "Talkback," Professor David Lozada III of the Ateneo de Manila University History Department likened historical events like the massacre at Bud Dajo in Sulu and the Balangiga Massacre in Samar to a "festering wound" that refuses to heal.

"From the perspective of a historian, it's important that these incidents are not swept under the rug. It's important that they're acknowledged, and it's important that they are remembered -- not to be used as a weapon to throw at our former colonial masters but more as a reminder for, let's say the Filipinos now, the youth of today -- that history is important. These incidents, though they're tragic and though they're very violent and they're brutal, they're part of our country's history. It's part of our growth as a peopleâ€¦ I would normally view it as like it's a festering wound that, instead of healing it, you tend to just hide it underneath your sleeve. If you just keep on hiding it, unless you deal with it directly, it's never gonna heal," he said.

President Rodrigo Duterte brought up the issue of the Bud Dajo massacre at an ASEAN Summit meeting last month in Laos, showing pictures of Americans standing over a crater filled with bodies of dead Filipinos.

After mentioning Bud Dajo, Duterte went on to remind people of another massacre committed by the Americans, this time in Samar.

In a speech at a Philippine Air Force event on September 13, Duterte also recalled the 1901 massacre in Balangiga, Samar, where residents over the age of 10 were ordered killed by US General Jacob Smith following a successful attack on US forces by Filipino rebels.

According to Lozada, acknowledging the incident, especially on the part of the United States, will help in atoning for what happened.

"If we go back to the discussion on atonement earlier, it's a step moving forward. Unless there's an acknowledgement that something has been done that is wrong, you cannot move forward because there's no acknowledgement that there was an error to begin with," he said, citing examples of how the U.S. and other powerful countries made amends to abuses and atrocities committed in the past.

He also said that returning the Balangiga Bells, which the Americans took as war trophies, will be a good starting point to atonement.

"I think that would help a lot in easing at least the current tensions that we have. It would take a supreme gesture on the part of the U.S. to actually arbitrarily just return the bells," Lozada said.
