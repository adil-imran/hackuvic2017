In a bid to strengthen ties with Russia amid mounting tensions with Pakistan, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is looking to sign several key deals during the Russian President's visit to Goa, southern India, for the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) Summit next week. The deal could set up India as one of the world's key military powers. It will include the purchase of five S-400 Triumf long-range air defence missile systems to add to the 12 it already has, Kamov-28 helicopters and upgrades of the Sukhoi 30-MKI, which India already has 272 of and has cost them more than £10billion, paid to the Russians.

The joint production of Kamov-226 light helicopters and the long awaited joint development of the fifth generation fighter aircraft (FGFA) are also set to get a boost from the meeting, Russia and India Report claims. If the S-400 deal goes through as planned it will be one of the biggest defence deals with Russia over the past few years and will increase India's striking abilities phenomenally.

India is hoping the deal will pacify Russia over its growing closeness with the United States and also send a strong message to Pakistan and China that India is prepared. China is the only other international buyer of the S-400 system so far. The system is capable of destroying missiles, drones and incoming hostile aircraft within a 250mile range.

Flying targets, even those equipped with stealth technologies, can be knocked out by the system. There are several suggestions India is planning to use three S-400 missile systems in the West - thought to be Pakistan - and two in the east - thought to be China.

Russia and India have a long history of developing and purchasing weapons technology together, dating back to the Soviet Union. Talks to develop the FGFA together were suspended over arguments concerning how much each country took part in research and development.

However, the £5bn deal is back on ahead of the Summit, with the final deal looking like Russia could make 100 fighter jets in India. Russia is also set to loan India another nuclear attack submarine for about £1.2bn, to add to its other nuclear submarine, INS Chakra.
