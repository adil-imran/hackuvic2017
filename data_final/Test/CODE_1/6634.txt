There are two sets of contrarians in the current US federal election. One consists of a growing throng of anti-Trump Republicans. However, some on the political left actively dislike Hillary Clinton and may even vote against her. Why?





Much of the opprobrium against Clinton centres on her husband's presidency in the nineties. During that period, both Bill and Hillary Clinton were 'neoliberals' who believed in associating politically progressive goals with abandoning the centre-left's traditional concern with government-directed redistribution of wealth through the welfare state, meager as it was in the United States compared to other western liberal democracies in Europe, Canada and Australasia. Both Clintons are judged to have acquiesced in the destruction of government social security programmes in bipartisan coalition with the Newt Gingrich-dominated Republican US Congress of the mid-nineties. While the Obama administration turned its back on that era and became more social democratic and akin to the mainstream European and Australasian centre-left as a result, Hillary Clinton is still accused of holding such anachronistic views and it is argued that she will implement them if allowed to do so through a presidential victory. More recently, Clinton has been pilloried for being a 'warmonger' who supported the Iraqi War quagmire under Republican President George W.Bush, even if the Obama administration has withdrawn most US troops from Afghanistan and Iraq.





There is a certain facile far left tendency which likes to label all US military intervention as "US imperialism,' even when the context says otherwise. Not all such military intervention is- the Bosnian War of the mid-nineties was mostly a "just war" that was necessary to constrain the aggressive religious persecution and ethnic cleansing carried out by Serbia amidst the ruins of the former Yugoslavia. The Afghan War was hampered by its theatre of war, a failed state, but the United States and its allies repelled the Taliban and the latter is too fragmented to reassert its former authority. In the current Syrian civil war, the Obama administration refuses to support the Assad dictatorship, which is a commendable stance to take, and backs anti-regime opposition movements that oppose ISIS and al Qaeda. The Iraqi War is the only such Middle Eastern conflict which does fit the classic portrait of "US imperialism," given that it was waged because the United States decided that Saddam Hussein was suddenly too vile to be propped up, and thus it deposed him. However, as Saddam was a dictator and Baathist Iraq was a highly authoritarian and regimented society, there was a civil society vacuum after its fall, filled by Sunni and Shia religious social conservatives alike. Both Islamist factions harrass, torture, assault and kill LGBT Iraqis and Syrians. However, it can be maintained that the Iraqi War was the fault of the prior George W.Bush administration, as Obama's immediate predecessor, and that Hillary Clinton had no direct responsibility for its coalescence or the conduct of war, given that she was an Opposition politician until the Obama administration appointed her as Secretary of State for Defence in 2008. It is true that she does bear responsibility for ill-advised US 'remedial' action that overthrow the Gaddhafi regime in Libya, only to be confronted by similar fragmentation given its lack of stable, autonomous civil society. However, Republican presidential contender Donald Trump also backed the Iraqi War before it became obvious that it had degenerated into a geopolitical quagmire, so the umbrage of the anti-Clinton far left on this issue is selective, to say the least.
