Dozens of officers responded to a mass shooting at the American Bank Center Thursday.

Fortunately, it was only a drill. Authorities had the opportunity to get prepared in case Corpus Christi ever falls victim to a mass shooting or terror attack.

The nightmare situation unfolded Thursday afternoon. Dozens of innocent people found themselves in the middle of an active shooter situation. Within moments, it was complete chaos. Officers, firefighters, and medics swarmed the facility. Multiple injured or dead victims were seen on the ground. Multiple gunmen exchanged fire with officers.

Though it was a drill, the situation was filled with emotion, panic, and worry.

Similar scenes have played out across the country and world recently. But they weren't drills.

From the terror attack in Paris last fall to the San Bernardino massacre in California in December. Unexpected attacks like those are what prompted local law enforcement to hold the drill

"It was all combined. It was all one incident. With an explosion and it turned into an active shooter situation," said CCFD Capt. James Brown. "With each agency dealing with issues that were in their field of expertise."

Thursday's effort included the American Bank Center staff, the CCPD, the Corpus Christi Fire Department, medics, hospitals, and any other agency that would be called during a real emergency.

It also included multiple active shooters and numerous victims.

"We had about twenty victims inside that they (emergency responders) had to deal with. Some dead, some alive, and then the suspects. So they're overwhelmed," said CCPD Sr. Officer Travis Pace who helped coordinate the drill.

Organizers kept it as realistic as possible. They had one goal in mind -- to save as many lives as possible.

"There's a lot of stuff we're doing good, and there's some stuff we can work on," said Pace. "And that's the purpose of this exercise. Work out the minor problems here rather than during the actual event."
