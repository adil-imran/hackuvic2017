Recently, the Nigerian Metrological Agency (NIMET) issued a flood warning on areas around major rivers and told the residents to evacuate to higher grounds. According to the agency, 10 states risk the possibility of serious flooding between August and October. These states include: Akwa Ibom, Bauchi, Benue, Bornu, Cross River, Delta, Kaduna, Kwara, Nasarawa, Yobe and Zamfara states. The report indicated that the high accumulation of rainfall in June and July has resulted in saturation of soil moisture in most river basins; this will lead to runoffs and eventually extensive flooding which will have a spillover effect and most likely cause havoc in the next three months.

In a similar vein, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has issued an advice to all communities living within the flood plains of most major rivers to relocate to higher grounds. The agency said that, Niger Basin Development Authority, in the Republic of Niger, notified Nigeria that the accumulation of high rainfall, in the middle Niger (Burkina Faso and Niger Republic) in June has led to the rise in level of River Niger in Niamey and is already spreading to Republic of Benin and invariably to Nigeria. This will undoubtedly trigger series of flooding along the banks of the Niger and its tributaries.

Flood warnings are now a regular feature in Nigeria. In 2013, despite the flood warning, there were massive deluge in the country which resulted in the death of hundreds of people, displacement of thousands and billions of naira worth of property lost. A special allocation was made by the federal government to bring succour to those who were affected and typically, in the Nigerian context, the monies never reached those that it was intended for. This year, there is serious indication all over the world that there may be more drastic effects of climate change that might result in some natural calamities. Already there are series of floods in the United States, in the Gulf of Mexico, there are also cases of massive floods in Europe with Macedonia being the hardest hit. In Asia, the Monsoons are not relenting and in China there are already cases of extreme weather. The highest recorded temperature occurred in Kuwait of above 54 degrees centigrade in recent times which is an indication of the uncertainty in precipitation the world over. The flood warnings issued by these two critical government agencies should not be taken lightly.

Over the years, most communities that live on flood prone areas tend to ignore flood warnings, until after the destructive effect when they will be waiting helplessly for government to assist them. On the other hand both NIMET and NEMA do not follow up on flood warnings, they just issue statements and fold their arms and wait even when they have data of flood progression data from upstream to downstream. They are supposed to take proactive measures. NIMET should constantly sound the alarms, informing the public and other agencies, especially NEMA, who should be the first line of defence. NEMAâ€™s main objective should be to prevent calamities before they occur; or in the least, reduce the hard effects on the populace. We have seen how some countries react when there is flood warning, China and the US are good examples, they deploy the military to critical areas to build emergency dams or embankments to check flood waters, and they build camps for the people and assist those that can easily be relocated to higher grounds. By the time the flood occurs, the effect is considerably reduced. We should borrow a leaf from these countries and do what is right and not when the tragedy has occurred that we revert to government for hand-outs. NIMET, NEMA, state governments and the federal government should sit up.
