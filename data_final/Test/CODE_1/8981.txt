ULA UPATA: GUNMEN have gone out of control at Ula Upata, Edioha, Ogoni and Yeghe communities in Rivers State, slaying a native doctor, senior lecturer, female student and four villagers in the last few weeks. Worried by the spate of attacks, the Inspector General of Police, Mr. Solomon Arase, has ordered deployment of a special homicide team to Port-Harcourt, capital of Rivers state, to assist the Rivers State Police Command crack down on the killer-gang.

How 30 gunmen went berserk: Niger Delta Voice learned that about 30 armed men, penultimate Saturday, stormed Ula Upata and neighboring Edioha communities in Ahoada East local government area of the state and wreaked havoc penultimate Saturday.

A source said the gangsters practically descended on the Zion Nwoka family and snuffed life out of 62-year-old Mrs. Monica Zion, Gospel Nwoka, 45, Mrs. Patricia Ziko, 42 and Rogers Nwoka, 28.

Even as police confirmed the worrisome deaths, nobody could say the reason for the bloodletting, as the killers extended their offensive to Edioha community, where they allegedly clubbed a native doctor to death. A similar occurred in Ula Upata about two months ago when suspected cultists invaded the area, killing about eight persons.

Tailed from Bori to Yeghe

Besides the Ula Upata and Edioha invasion, the gunmen trailed a senior lecturer of Ken Saro Wiwa Polytechnic Polytechnic, Dr. Vincent Eebee on his way to Port-Harcourt and shot him dead. NDV learned that they trailed him from the Polytechnic in Bori and started shooting at his vehicle after he drove past Birabi Memorial Grammer School, BMGS, on the Bori-Yeghe road.

A female passenger in his vehicle identified as a student of the Polytechnic also died in the sad incident. Eyewitnesses said the late Dr Eebee managed to drive to Yeghe community and bolted from his car, but the assailants allegedly caught up with him and ensured he was dead before they sped off in a black SUV.

Why I deployed homicide squad – IGP

Meanwhile, the police have deployed special homicide detectives to fish out the rampaging killer- gangs in Rivers. Arase told reporters in Port Harcourt: “Criminal gangs cannot overwhelm a state or a country, it is never done. I can assure the people of the country that we will clamp down on these gangs; we will amputate them from our society.”

“They are being investigated at the state by the state Police command, but I have also dispatched a team of homicide investigators from Abuja. When things like this happen, there are always different accounts to it. I have said the police will always be apolitical and professional at all times with our operations and investigations,” he asserted.

Police‘ll fish out killers – Commissioner

On his part, the state Police Commissioner, Mr. Musa Kimo, who visited Ula Upata community, said armed police officers were still on ground at Ula Upata and Edioha communities, Ahoada East local government area, maintaining peace He assured the families of those who lost loved ones that the police were doing everything possible to bring the killers to book.
