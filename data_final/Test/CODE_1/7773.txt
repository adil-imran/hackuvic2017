Actor George Clooney marked the anniversary of a massacre of Armenians by Ottoman Turks in 1915. The actor presented a million dollar award to a Burundi woman who offered sanctuary to thousands of orphans in the middle of a civil war there. The killing of more than 200 Armenian intellectuals on April 24, 1915 is regarded as the start of the massacre widely viewed as the first genocide of the 20th century. About 1.5 million Armenians were slaughtered. Clooney presented the first Aurora Prize to Marguerite Barankitse, who saved thousands of lives amid the Burundi civil war. The 101st anniversary is a source of disagreement, with Turkey refusing to call the deaths a genocide. President Obama also refused to use the term breaking a key campaign promise as his presidency nears an end.
