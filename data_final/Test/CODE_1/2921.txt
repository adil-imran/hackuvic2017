Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan yesterday called on Myanmar to take effective steps to uproot Yaba factories in its territories, saying Bangladesh appears to be a victim of the cross-border smuggling of the deadly drug.

"Despite the fact that drug is not produced in Bangladesh the people of the country are exposed to severe damage due to cross-border smuggling of drugs from the neighbouring country," he told a high level meeting of interior ministers of Indian Ocean region to counter drugs trafficking at the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo.

He said drug traffickers were smuggling Yaba, a contraband pill, to Bangladesh through the rugged frontiers of Chittagong region, close to Myanmar.

The minister, however, told the conference that Bangladesh adopted "zero tolerance policy" against drug smuggling and abuse.

"Our government is committed to control narcotic drugs in line with the United Nations Convention and the conventions of Saarc (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and BIMSTEC [Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation]," he said.

He urged all member states of the Indian Ocean region to counter drug trafficking and its abuse by taking coordinated efforts.

Yaba, which in Thai means "crazy medicine‚Äù, is also called as horse drug. It is given to horses when pulling carts up steep hills and during other strenuous work. According to experts it is made of methamphetamine and caffeine.

In recent years Bangladesh became a destination for Yaba, mainly smuggled from Myanmar, for being popular among youths.

Long-term use of it causes decline in cognitive functions, according to experts.

Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) and police identified that Bangladesh's southeastern Teknaf border with Myanmar was the main route for Yaba smuggling.

In recent years, due to the increase in Yaba smuggling on Bangladesh-Myanmar borders, paramilitary border forces of the two countries mobilised extra troops on the frontiers.

BGB officials said the smugglers now preferred sea routes in view of intensified vigil on the Bangladesh-Myanmar frontier.

With the assistance of the United Nations Office for Narcotics and Crime, Colombo hosts the conference with participation of home ministers of Bangladesh, Comoros, India, Iran, Madagascar, Mozambique, Seashells and Tanzania.
