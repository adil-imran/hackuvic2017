A civil war within the Samajwadi Party has thrown party members for a loop ahead of crucial Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh early next year. The long-simmering feud between chief minister Akhilesh Yadav and his uncle Shivpal Yadav came out in the open on Tuesday. Complicating matters, Akhilesh’s father, SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav, has come down on the side of his brother Shivpal. After the UP CM removed two Shivpal loyalists from key positions on Monday, Mulayam retaliated by making Shivpal the state’s party chief. Then Akhilesh upped the ante and stripped Shivpal himself of most of his portfolios. Here are 10 points to understand the Yadav vs Yadav power tussle.

1. Face-off over DP Yadav It all began in 2012, when Akhilesh refused to have controversial UP leader DP Yadav join the Samajawadi Party. DP Yadav had the backing of senior party leaders including Shivpal, Mohan Singh and Azam Khan, but Akhilesh got his way.

2. Second blow to Shivpal Shivpal suffered another blow when Mulayam backed his son Akhilesh to be Uttar Pradesh chief minister after the 2012 assembly elections. This came as a surprise to Shivpal. Akhilesh was unanimously chosen as the leader of the party in a meeting of SP legislators.

3. Row over merger move with Qaumi Ekta Dal Having succesfully blocked DP Yadav, Akhilesh was furious when the party of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari, Qaumi Ekta Dal (QAD), was allowed to merge with the SP. He, in turn, sacked Balram Yadav, a close aide of Shivpal’s.

4. Akhilesh has his way The SP parliamentary board — the party's highest policy making body — then called off the merger with QED in three days, but decided to reinduct Balram. This was perhaps to ensure Akhilesh didn’t get his way on everything, but it also showed party members there was dissension in the ranks.

5. Differences play out at birthday party Differences between Shivpal and Akhilesh also played out during a birthday party of Ram Gopal Yadav, another of Mulayam's brothers. Shivpal arrived so late to the party, that Ram Gopal had already cut the birthday cake while in the presence of Mulayam, Akhilesh and other key leaders. Instead of going up to on the dais with his family, Shivpal then sat among the invitees. He was persuaded to go sit with his family - which Shivpal did- but he still conveyed his distance from them by sitting in a back row and not even wishing Ram Gopal.

6. Tussle over chief secretary Akhilesh and Shivpal also disagreed on whom to appoint as the state's chief secretary after incumbent Alok Ranjan's term ended on June 30. Deepak Singhal, who was earlier principal secretary at a department held by Shivpal, was named to the post, but Akhilesh shunted him out in a mere two months.

7. Shivpal's resignation threat Last month, Shivpal threatened to resign citing rampant corruption in the Akhilesh Yadav-led Uttar Pradesh government. He alleged some party workers and office-bearers are involved in “land-grabbing and harassment of the public". Shivpal warned that lawmakers involved in such activities would be expelled from the party. Mulayam openly backed Shivpal on this issue. He and warned the party that Shivpal resigning at that juncture wouldn’t augur well for the party.

8. Mulayam empowers Shivpal As Akhilesh continued to make anti-Shivpal moves, Mulayam kept empowering Shivpal and went as far as to make him party chief in Uttar Pradesh, replacing his own son, Akhilesh.

9. Akhilesh strikes back at Shivpal In turn, Akhilesh then retaliated by withdrawing almost all the portfolios from his uncle Shivpal. Akhilesh removed Shivpal as PWD, Irrigation, Flood Control, and Cooperatives Minister, bringing down the number of portfolios held by him from ten to just two. This rendered him almost completely powerless.
