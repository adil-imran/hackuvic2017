Nationalism (and let’s be clear, the current backlash against immigration and transnational-ism is nationalist in its core) can be bloody. Particularly if the transational-ists have set up ethnic minorities within the majority culture. This happened during the imperial period: the Russians, for instance, encouraged both Jews and Germans to settle in their territory.

But nationalism finds this difficult. It wants a pure culture. And that can be bloody.

And to preempt all the idiots: The religious and ethnic cleansing extends to everyone. We may see lots of Mexicans dying in America in an ethnic cleansing, but we also may see lots of whites dying in America in an ethnic cleansing. Forecasting an event is not endorsing or prescribing it.

The neo con project is, to its core, transnational. It is the idea that all nations want democracy. Like superman, they want truth, justice, and the American way. But the American way is for Americans. It is not for the Commonwealth: our cry is King and country: it used to be King and Empire before the Imperium became unfashionable.

But the neo con project failed, abjectly, in Iraq. Moreover, the post neo conservative, progressive rainbow coloured revolutions have also failed — in past because the locals simply don’t want to become part of the Unitarian convergence, and decline.

They see, as does the USA, or Turkey, or Finland, or Russia, that their nation and their way of life will disappear into some homogenous blob, with their myths being fuel for the next set of Disney movies. They hate this.

And they may fight. Spengler gets many things wrong, but his warning of the consequences of this, historically, is important.

Nations do not fight to the death, but they frequently fight until their pool of prospective fighters has reached a point of practical exhaustion. In most cases, this involves reaching the 30% mark where casualties are concerned. Wars of this character demarcate many turning points in world history. They include the Peloponnesian War, the Thirty Years War, the Napoleonic Wars, the American Civil War and, at least in some respects, the two World Wars of the 20th century. The 30% solution appears yet again in Germany’s casualty figures during the Second World War. Germany lost 5,330,000 of 17,718,714 men aged 15-44 years, or again 30% of the total. There are disturbing similarities in these wars to the present situation in Western Asia. There is no simple common characterization that applies to all the wars of demographic exhaustion, but there surely are common elements to be found in all or most of them. These include the belief that the alternative to pursuing the war would be national ruin, as well as the belief of ordinary soldiers that the war will lead to their social and economic advancement for ordinary soldiers (the “field marshal’s baton in the rucksack”). These were existential wars rather than wars of choice in the minds of the major combatants. Wide historical surveys risk selecting data that fits broad patterns, to be sure, but the parallelisms are sufficiently compelling to make the effort worthwhile. What we know of these wars challenges the usual way in which we think about rationality in politics. With hindsight, the decision to initiate and continue hostilities on this scale seems an act of madness. In most cases, moreover, the greatest number of casualties occurred after hope of ultimate victory had diminished or disappeared. The principal actors, to be sure, evinced a certain kind of rationality, albeit of a perverse order: They believed that failure to fight and win would undermine their national raison d’etre. In fact, their fear of national decline was not entirely misplaced. In many cases the consequence of war was a catastrophic decline marked by falling birth rates and declining population, wealth and power after the cessation of hostilities. The population of Greece declined sharply after the Peloponnesian War. After the Napoleonic Wars, France entered a long period of demographic stagnation and relative decline.

If there is war, particularly in the West, it is likely to be a civil war, between the older populations and the new minority. The elite hate the base population, who as Obama noted, cling to their bibles and guns. They echo Brecht.

The Solution. After the uprising of the 17th June

The Secretary of the Writers Union

Had leaflets distributed in the Stalinallee

Stating that the people

Had forfeited the confidence of the government

And could win it back only

By redoubled efforts. Would it not be easier

In that case for the government

To dissolve the people

And elect another?

But this will be horrible. Such a war will not have the restrictions nor the structure of state based systems. There will be no Geneva convention. There will be no uniforms. It will be bloody and it will be fought until exhaustion.

Much better would be to avoid this.

But that means we have to stop electing those who would dissolve the people.
