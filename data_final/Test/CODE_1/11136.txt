The trial against activist Lena Hendry continued today, with her lawyer positing that the compact disc (CD) seized by the authorities during a raid on the film screening two years ago is not that of the contentious film.

Lena is charged with screening a documentary on ethnic cleansing in Sri Lanka at the Kuala Lumpur and Selangor Chinese Assembly Hall, without the approval of the Film Censorship Board on July 8, 2013.

The Home Ministry's Film Controls Department, Immigration Department and police personnel raided the hall during the screening, stopped the screening and seized a compact disc.
