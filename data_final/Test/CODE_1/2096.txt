No one expected last month’s international arbitration court decision to be the last word on the tug-of-war over the South China Sea and its many islands, rocks and reefs. The waterway is too strategically important and the disputes too complex for the competing claims by China and five other countries in the region to be quickly resolved. Yet provocations continue, raising questions about China’s commitment to the rule of law and heightening fears of a wider conflict.

In last month’s decision, a five-judge panel in The Hague ruled unanimously that China had no legal basis to claim longstanding rights over most of the South China Sea, which is rich in resources and carries out $5 trillion in annual trade.

The judgment, more sweeping and categorical than expected, also faulted China for its aggressive attempts to enlarge its domain by shipping in tons of dirt to transform small reefs and rocks into artificial islands with airstrips and military structures.

From the start, China refused to participate in the tribunal proceedings and has since refused to accept the ruling, while showing its defiance in numerous ways. Last week, China’s Supreme Court said that people caught fishing in “Chinese” waters could be jailed for up to a year, while the defense minister warned that China should prepare for a “people’s war at sea” to protect national sovereignty.

Meanwhile, new satellite photos showed that China has reinforced aircraft hangars in the Spratly Islands so as to absorb an airstrike, thus contradicting President Xi Jinping’s 2015 assurance that his government would not militarize the islets. China has also conducted air patrols over disputed areas, announced that it would hold war games with Russia and interfered in waters customarily used by Filipino fishermen.

China is not alone in engaging in risky maneuvers. On Wednesday Reuters reported that Vietnam had recently stationed new mobile rocket launchers on five bases in the Spratly Islands.

Fortunately, none of the claimants, which also include the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei and Malaysia, have tried to take the sort of action that could cause a full-blown crisis, such as China’s threat to declare an air defense zone over the sea and to insist that all planes obtain permission before crossing through it.

The Obama administration has played an important restraining role. It has also demonstrated resolve in defending America’s commitment to freedom of navigation by sending warships into the South China Sea, close to some of the disputed lands. Although the Philippines’ new president, Rodrigo Duterte, has sent mixed messages about how he plans to handle China, his decision to send one of his predecessors, Fidel Ramos, to hold exploratory talks with the Chinese could help advance a peaceful solution.

But China holds the key. In 2012, Mr. Xi called for a new relationship in which China and the United States would seek together to manage conflict. And China has a compelling economic interest in a stable region. But China’s activities in the South China Sea have increasingly persuaded more and more people that it is determined to put into place the military facilities that will allow Beijing to bully and dominate its coastal neighbors.

So far, Mr. Xi has only succeeded in worsening tensions, making other countries fearful and suspicious and pushing them into new security relationships, with the United States and with one another.
