An 84-year old man, Muazu Isa, his son and grandchild, have been arraigned before a Magistrates’ Court in Kaduna, over alleged serial rape of a 10-year-old orphan.

The prosecutor, Insp. Anthony Idoko, told the court that the case was reported to the police on August 1.

He said that the other accused persons are the man’s son, Bashir, 24, and his grandchild, Ya’u.

The accused was the former Village Head of Angwan Dosa in Kaduna, but was dethroned by the Zazzau Emirate Council over the rape scandal.

Idoko explained that the girl was in the care of Muazu when they took turn to rape her.

The prosecution said the offence contravened Section 283 of the Penal Code.

He said, “The police are still investigating the matter. I, therefore urge the court to adjourn the case to Oct. 14 when Bashir, his son is expected to appear before the court, for further mention.

“I equally appeal that the accused be remanded in prison custody.”

The Magistrate, Abdulazeez Ibrahim granted the prosecution’s request and ordered that the accused be remanded in prison, and adjourned the case till Oct. 14, for further mention.

The case was instituted by an NGO, Arrida Relief Foundation of Nigeria (ARFON).

Its President, Hajiya Rabi Ibraheem, said that the rape victim was found wandering and was brought to Mu’azu by the police, to locate and hand the girl over to her parents.

She said, “It seems the girl was an orphan and was adopted by the people she called her parents, who took her to Abuja to work as house help from where ran away and was found by the police.

“The girl told the police that she is from Angwan Dosa, Kaduna, so they brought her to the accused to help locate her parents.”

According to her, the accused’s own daughter caught him having canal knowledge of the girl and the matter was taken to local vigilante groups in the area.

“The vigilante took the girl from him and handed her over to Falinga Foundation, who equally handed her over to us before we took the case to the police.”

Also, Bukola Ajao, state Chairperson, International Federation of Women Lawyers, said they would ensure that the law takes its course.
