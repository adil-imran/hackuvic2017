Although the festival of Durga puja is over but the hangover seems to refuse to go.

With Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee choosing to paint the state in festive mood, the spirit of Durga puja continues to linger. The government has organised a grand parade of the 39 best pujas today; based on the category of pandal, Durga idol, lighting, decor and above all the atmosphere. The parade is being held along the main arterial road of the city.

The city wants the flavour of the festival to stay on forgetting the traffic bottlenecks, congested roads and plight of commuters. The parade is going to be a visual treat for all those people, who could not go pandals hopping to watch some of the finest artistic creations.

The traditional dance of Bengal Chau, Santhali dance, classical, Manipuri, Bengal's baul and folk artists will perform as they trundle down the road along with the idols. There will be lights, songs, dance to the accompaniment of dhamsa-madol and Bengal's traditional dhaak.

SWEET END



The government is spending lakhs for the carnival to ensure a smooth ride for Durga idols before the immersion. Watch towers, giant screens and 1500 police personnel on ground are part of the event. Ambulances will keep a close watch on the programme. There is accommodation for 25,000 seats but going by the general euphoric mood of Bengalis and their love for the festival, the crowd could swell to over a lakh.
