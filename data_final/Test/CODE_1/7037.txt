Inside information: Mexican officials terrified of loser class coming home

Inside information | 6 April 2016 | Mene Mene Tekel Upharsin

Posted on by MeneMeneTekelUpharsin

My sources of information tell me that Mexican officials are literally "terrified" that they are going to have to deal with the class of people who have come over here during the last 20 years or so who have little or no hope in Mexico. They are well aware of the fact that the numbers are close to 30 million, not 12 million. Most of the illegals here are those who did not want to study in school or who are criminals (fairly small percentage of the total). Aside from the drug war, they have maintained some political stability by ushering these people out of the country and into the United States and they do NOT want them back.

It appears Trump knows exactly what is going on. Also, U.S. officials also know what is going on as does the media and no one is admitting it for fear of the United States citizens rising up against them for the treachery. Only Trump has directly touched on this topic in a blunt manner. The powers that be are extremely nervous.

The day may eventually come when we will be forced to invade MX and kill the drug cartels. (who support the current POLs) MX political system is so thoroughly corrupt there is no hope of ever fixing it. It is a cultural disorder. Truth has never been valued in much of MX.

Yup. Overclass in Mexico has no intention of paying welfare to keep the Mestizos breeding. They don’t have schools, jobs or prisons to take care of them. Send the creme of the crap to El Norte to intimidate and dilute Gringolandia. Added bonus: get Mexican scum class into power and start siphoning off major cash back home. Tribute por Los Caudillos.



To: MeneMeneTekelUpharsin

Rather reminds me of Africa not wanting their human exports back, either.



To: Texas Fossil

And while we’re at it, they can take care of our loser democrat demons since we’ve been footing the bill for their guys for many, many generations now.



To: MeneMeneTekelUpharsin

Another sad story from Texas this AM, of an illegal alien, deported but back in TX, killing a volunteer fire fighter and his two children in a head on car crash caused by the illegal crossing the median. He was probably drunk, because illegals specialize in carnage on our highways caused by drunk driving. Where is the updated body count of Americans killed by illegal aliens? The last I’ve seen is almost 30,000 dead and many more than that injured for life. These are filthy, lawless termites that eat away at our country and should have been eradicated zealously for the past 40 years for the good of this nation.



To: MeneMeneTekelUpharsin

You speak of Mexico and probably a majority are from Mexico. But many are from other

countries and have to traverse Mexico to get here. Even a lot of the Cubans now go west

and then north thru Mexico in the trip.



To: MeneMeneTekelUpharsin

And speaking of which, this is the POS who is the Secretary of State for California, Alex Padilla, one of the first Anchor Babies: This is the guy in charge of VOTING in California. Real American, Right?



To: MeneMeneTekelUpharsin

Trump is exposing the scum here in this country who are covering for the scum in Mexico. The neo-con artists and their open borders toadies hate Trump for exposing them for the anti-American democrats they really are.



To: MeneMeneTekelUpharsin

Because it means that when the elites in Mexico refuse to give the losers entitlements they will get a full-scale revolution. They simply don’t have the resources to devote to the millions of unwashed masses that could come stumbling home to mama.



To: MeneMeneTekelUpharsin

Recently it was reported that remittances have overtaken oil as the top source of revenue for Mexico. Think about it—Mexicans working in the US sending money home to relatives is the primary “industry” of Mexico! They are literally feeding like parasites off our economy.

Well, since your on that subject, yes an adjustment is in order there too. It is called criminal prosecution and restoration of the rule of law. Does any POL have the balls to do it? Guess we will see.

Let the corrupt cartel in Mexico City deal with a few million military aged males agitating for change instead of using the US for a poverty safety valve. We function as an excuse for them to do nothing regarding economic and social reforms. the narrative needs to be turned back on them. That goes for Central and South America also. Its about time these corrupt regimes be forced to clean up their own back yards instead of dumping their problems on us for the US taxpayer to take care of.



To: MeneMeneTekelUpharsin

While I don’t disagree with the point that they are afraid of the losers coming home, I think they are absolutely terrified of the successful Mexicans coming back. It’s the successful ones who have the drive to overturn the political system. They’ve not only seen something more successful, they’ve actually lived and thrived using our system, and they aren’t going to settle so easily.

I remember a few years back Vicente Fox going on in some speech about how great it was for Mexicans to be able to live “The American Dream”. The question that should have been posed to his is “Why is there no Mexican Dream?”.

The current President of Mexico and his family Freeper Chickensoup observes: when people ask me about the Mexican illegal aliens, I just say that I am uncomfortable with being complicit with the Mexican ethnic cleansing by elite and wealthy Mexicans against their indigenous population. Here's what the USA gets:

To: MeneMeneTekelUpharsin

My contention has always been that anyone who really “cares” about Mexicans would seal the border up tight so the Mexican government was forced to provide for the needs of their citizens. Having the U.S. as a safety valve just allows Mexican corruption to thrive. But, of course, on our side of the border, it has nothing to do with caring and everything to do with obtaining political power.



To: Regulator

The contempt the Mexican upper class has for the common man in Mexico cannot be overstated. You won't see it in lofty speeches or proclamations, which would give you the opposite impression, but in their daily acts. I'll give one small example. I was once traveling in the Yucatan and stopped at a roadside stand to look at some crystal. People who sell things like that, or rugs, or blankets, or jewelry, are unbelievably poor by our standards and pray that they might catch someone's attention who might look at their merchandise and might actually buy something. That's what they start their day hoping for. As I was looking at the rocks, a Mexican couple in a late model Mercedes puled up and got out, probably to stretch their legs. They came over to the stand and immediately began insulting and making fun of the proprietor in very cruel terms, and going on about how she was selling junk, just trash. It was all in Spanish, so I knew it wasn't for my benefit. The owner just took it in stride, expressionless, like it was something that happened every day.

That would be a way to crush the cartels and send everyone home. But what is best for Americans doesn’t matter anymore, compared to mexico’s feelings or Hispanic-Americans.

To: Texas Fossil

The day may eventually come when we will be forced to invade MX and kill the drug cartels. Indeed. The words, "clear and present danger" come to mind.



To: MeneMeneTekelUpharsin

There is a huge demand in Mexico for criminals. Mexico is run by gangs.

That’s how we feel about sending them come here.

It takes both to make a revolution. Both the successful ones with the drive, and the not-so-successful millions of men of military age who will actually make it happen.

To: MeneMeneTekelUpharsin

Its stupid to imagine that the folks here are the criminals and ones who don’t study, their government fears them, on the contrary, because they are the industrious who would foment a revolution were it not for the release valve of the US.

Same thing with the bubble economy. You’ll notice Woodward when they interviewed him said what an “unusual” choice it was for a candidate to say that, and economists interviewed said the same thing, like that was the official line or something. Nobody disputed what he said factually, just the ad hominem attack. They know he’s right.

“The day may eventually come when we will be forced to invade MX and kill the drug cartels.” Kind of pointless. As long as the drugs remain as valuable as they are, other cartels would just pop right back up to service the demand.



To: MeneMeneTekelUpharsin

Does anyone know if people here illegally can still vote in their home country? Do they have write in votes, do they get counted? Does anyone bother??

To: chrisser

Having the U.S. as a safety valve just allows Mexican corruption to thrive. But it also helps to forestall a Venezuela-style Communist revolution, which the elites in both countries fear more than anything.



To: Boogieman

Actually that is not true. MX is the only nation we have a common Southern border with. Yes, it can come in by ship, boat, airplane. But it is harder to actually infiltrate large numbers of people in that mode. MX leadership is and has always been thoroughly corrupt. And anti-US.

To: PUGACHEV

Thats what I saw. Cruel doesn’t begin to describe it. Its a 14th century feudal society there still. As Edward Abbey said, we should stop the illegals at the border, hand them a gun, and turn them around. They’ll know what they need to do when they go back.



To: MeneMeneTekelUpharsin

The Palestinians of Mexico?



To: Mr. Jeeves

Yep, they are going to vote for communists in our country, rather than theirs.

To: Texas Fossil

“Yes, it can come in by ship, boat, airplane. But it is harder to actually infiltrate large numbers of people in that mode.” We’re talking about infiltrating drugs, not people. Still, even if it becomes harder to bring the drugs over, the drugs just fetch a higher price, which means more profits, and a greater incentive for black marketeers to deal in them. It’s a economic feedback loop that will never be stopped by attacking the suppliers.



To: Boogieman

I don’t have your Malthusian perspective on the futility of ending the drug traffic.

To: MeneMeneTekelUpharsin

Yep, it’s how the White-European Mexican elites think they’ll keep their heads from going on pikes.



To: RightGeek

The wife of the Mexican President is a former Novela actress. Almost everyone on Mexican Soap Operas is lily-white.



To: Texas Fossil

“I dont have your Malthusian perspective on the futility of ending the drug traffic.” Look up what Milton Friedman had to say about it. L

To: BlackAdderess

Does anyone know if people here illegally can still vote in their home country? Yes, in the case of Mexico for sure and others probably. They can also still vote in Mexico if they nationalize as well.



To: Texas Fossil

I never said anything about the futility of ending drug traffic, what I have said is that simply attacking the problem from the supply side is futile, which it is. As long as a profit can be made selling a good, there will be someone willing to supply it. Therefore, the only feasible way to reduce the flow of a certain good is to attack the demand, so that it becomes less profitable to trade in that good. This is basic economics 101 stuff, it applies to EVERY good, not just drugs.
