The Deir Yassin Massacre was not the only massacre committed by the Zionist entity, according to the UAE’s Al Khaleej. “Since its establishment, the Zionist entity has committed dozens of mass crimes against the Palestinians. However, the Deir Yassin Massacre remains a key event for the Zionists. Menachem Begin, a former Israeli Prime Minister, said that the massacre resulted in 635,000 Palestinians fleeing and that only 165,000 remained. The success of that massacre led to the Zionist gangs and entity continuing to carry out similar massacres to achieve political and military gains. Killing civilians is not merely a policy adopted by Zionists during combat, but is rather the norm, as witnessed by events in the West Bank’s streets and neighbourhoods. The goal behind such policies is to instil fear into the hearts of Palestinians so they will not resist acts that violate their rights, and also to make the lives of Palestinians a living hell so they will migrate.”

Israel has confiscated Palestinian lands ever since its establishment in 1948, and drove out more than 80 per cent of Palestinians from their homes, said Oman’s Al Watan. “Israel continues to steal the Palestinian lands, and none of us are even batting an eyelash. The Arab world’s silence continues, apparently content with just issuing condemnations. Moreover, international consent for Israeli terrorism continues to rise. As a result, it is not strange for us to witness the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continue its barbaric attacks against the Palestinian people, land and nation. These attacks continue to escalate and lead to the confiscation and Judaisation of Palestinian lands. The recent attacks carried out by Israel are rising in intensity, particularly at a time when the world is busy with the war it’s waging against terrorism.”

Qatar’s determined stand has been to support the Palestinians, said the country’s Al Sharq newspaper. “Qatar has not spared any effort in the present or during the past decades in supporting Palestine through active diplomatic efforts. It continues to assist the Palestinians and defend their rightful cause so that they can obtain their legitimate rights in all international arenas and fields.

“Such a stand stems from Doha’s staunch belief in the righteousness of the cause and the right of return of Palestinians. Qatar has been keen on convincing the international community, which is currently waging a war on terrorism, not to confuse the Palestinian’s legitimate national resistance against the Occupation as destructive terrorism, but rather a logical result of the aggression exercised by the Occupation against the Palestinians.”

Israeli human rights organisation B’Tselem, along with Human Rights Watch and the United Nations have long accused Israeli soldiers and border police of using excessive force, said the Saudi Gazette. “However, there was never any clear proof like the video clip of an Israeli soldier firing a bullet into the head of an incapacitated Palestinian. For Israelis, the incident speaks to a belief that security can only come by imposing ever-harsher order and control over Palestinians. But it is wrong to meet Palestinian aggression by imposing more control and more force. Palestinians are deserving of comparable treatment that would be accorded to Israelis. Palestinians cannot participate in the Israeli political system that ultimately rules them, and this leaves them with few ways to make themselves heard other than by hitting back.”
