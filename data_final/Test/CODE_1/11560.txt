PanARMENIAN.Net - Uruguay’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the situation in the Nagorno Karabakh conflict zone.

As Armenia’s Foreign Ministry reports, the South American nation expressed concern over the escalating violence that has killed many, including civilians.

These actions seriously violate the 1994 ceasefire agreement, Uruguay said, calling on all sides “to end the military confrontation, reduce the tension along the contact line and find ways towards a peaceful settlement of the conflict under the auspices of the OSCE Minsk Group.”

As many as 20 Karabakh servicemen were killed and 70 were wounded in the course of military operations. In addition, 4 civilians and 7 volunteers have been killed.

26 Karabakh soldiers have gone missing so far.

As of 10:00 p.m., April 5, the Azerbaijani side has lost 29 tanks and over 5 armored vehicles, including an IFV, as well as 1 TOS-1A Solntsepyok multiple rocket launcher, 1 BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launcher, 2 military helicopters and 7 unmanned aerial vehicles.

Seven Karabakh tanks have been neutralized since April 2. The Armenian side has lost eight positions (300 meters overall).
