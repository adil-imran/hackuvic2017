Ref: 67/2003





Today, 15 May 2003, is the

55th anniversary of Al-Nakba – the tragic uprooting and

dispossession of the Palestinian people.

On 15 May 1948, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forcibly

expelled from their homes during large-scale Jewish attacks, using warplanes, tanks

and other weapons. Palestinians were also the victims of massacres committed by

Zionist gangs in Arab towns and villages.

The Jewish people were brought to Palestine from around the world to

establish a state on the lands of the indigenous Palestinian people, who were

slaughtered and forced to flee to neighboring Arab counties as a result. The

Palestinians were again victimized in 1967 when the remainder of Palestine was

also occupied by Israeli forces.



This anniversary comes

while the Israeli government continues its war against the

Palestinian people in the Occupied Territories.

Israeli occupying forces continue to

kill and dispossess Palestinians, destroy homes and land and carry out

ethnic cleansing in occupied Jerusalem. These acts are reminiscent of al-Nakba,

when grave breaches of human rights were committed against women, children, the

elderly and the disabled. Furthermore, they represent the continued

victimization of the Palestinian people.

Four 55 years, the issue of

the Palestine refugees has not been solved, in spite of United Nations General

Assembly Resolution 194 of 11 December 1948. In light of the international

community’s failure to solve this crisis which has left over 5 million

Palestinians living as stateless refugees, PCHR reminds the international community

of its obligation to enforce international and humanitarian law and put an end

to the needless suffering which has already lasted for more than half a

century.

The international

community, through the United Nations, is legally and morally responsible for

enforcing international humanitarian law and human rights law, which includes

the inalienable right of Palestinian refugees to return and/or seek

compensation. International humanitarian and human rights law further guarantee

the Palestinian people the right to self-determination and additional civil,

political, economic, social and cultural rights.
