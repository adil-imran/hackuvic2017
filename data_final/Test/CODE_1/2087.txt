TEL AVIV-A Palestinian gunman shot and killed two Israelis as he drove through the streets of Jerusalem, police said Sunday, in what Israeli authorities described as a terror attack.

Israeli police shot dead the 39-year-old assailant less than five minutes after the spree started, chasing him on motorcycles and engaging in a short gunbattle, police said. Two officers were wounded in the exchange of fire.

The assailant shot five Israelis, including the dead, before being stopped by police. Another two people were involved in a car accident in the midst of the rampage, Israel's ambulance service said.

A 60-year-old woman and a 30-year old man were rushed to Hadassah hospital in Jerusalem and later died from their wounds, a hospital spokeswoman said. Several other Israelis had wounded limbs, the ambulance service added.

The attacker began his spree near a light rail station in the city's north before moving to the neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah in East Jerusalem, police said. He was a resident of East Jerusalem, the holy city's predominantly Arab sector.

A court in Jerusalem issued a ban on media publishing further details about the names of the victims and the attacker, police said. It wasn't immediately clear why the order had been requested.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wished the victims a speedy recovery and commended the fast response from security personnel at a weekly cabinet meeting, according to a statement from his office.

Islamist movement Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, didn't claim responsibility for the attack, but issued a statement calling the shooting "heroic" and "a normal reply to the crimes of the Israeli occupation." Hamas has called on young Palestinians to carry out so-called lone wolf attacks against Israelis.

The shooting is the latest incident in a year-long spate of violence by Palestinians against Israelis. It came amid heightened security measures enacted for the Jewish holidays. Israeli Jews last week celebrated the Jewish New Year of Rosh Hashana, and will this week mark Yom Kippur, the day of atonement.

Attacks have become more sporadic in recent months due in part to tighter security measures by Israeli authorities. The military last month deployed hundreds of soldiers to reinforce the occupied West Bank after a spike in knife and car-ramming attacks ahead of the holidays.

The wave of bloodshed that flared last October has left 42 Israelis dead and more than 500 wounded, according to Israeli officials.

Israeli security forces have killed some 200 Palestinians, most after attacks against Israelis, Palestinian officials said.
