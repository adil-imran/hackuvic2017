IT’S fair to say they’re not exactly the best of friends.

In fact tensions between the US and Russia are so high that the global political situation is now “more dangerous” than during the Cold War.

That’s the view of German foreign minister Frank-Walker Steinmeir who said the current situation between the superpowers was more dangerous than ever, not helped by ongoing tensions in Syria.

In an interview with German tabloid Bild, Steinmeir warned that at least during the Cold War the superpowers had “red lines and respected them”.

Steinmeir said tensions between Russia and the US are not only growing but that trust between them has all but been exhausted.

“If this continues, we fall back in times of confrontation between two great powers,” he said.

“But unfortunately it is an illusion to believe that it was the old Cold War.”

“Previously, the world was divided into two, but Moscow and Washington knew their red lines and respected them.”

He did mostly blame Russia for invoking tensions between east and west.

However, he also said it was crucial that world leaders find a solution to the Syrian crisis before it’s too late.

WAR CRIME CALL

The warning comes after France’s foreign minister called on the International Criminal Court to investigate Russia for possible war crimes in Syria.

Jean-Marc Ayrault told France-Inter radio that “France intends to get in touch with the prosecutor to find out how the probe can be launched”.

Ayrault said his nation disagreed with Russia’s “bombarding” of Aleppo and “is committed as never before to saving the population.”

He said such an investigation would hinge on Moscow’s role in the aerial offensive in the rebel-held eastern part of the city.

Meanwhile as tensions rise, Russia has blocked a UN Security Council resolution proposed by France and Spain on ending the hostilities.

Tensions have soared since Washington pulled the plug on talks with Moscow aimed at reviving a Syria truce deal, citing Russia’s brutal bombing campaign.

Russia on Saturday vetoed a UN draft resolution on stopping Russian and Syrian regimen air strikes on the war-ravaged city of Aleppo, with the United States calling for a war crimes probe into the carnage.

Russia has supported the Syrian government with a bombing campaign against rebel groups in the country for more than a year.

The US and some Middle Eastern powers have backed certain rebel groups seeking to overthrow the Syrian government.
