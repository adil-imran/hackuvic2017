SCOTS are facing further transport disruption as Storm Henry continues to batter the country with high winds and torrential rain.

The storm caused travel chaos for commuters making their way home from work on Monday evening amid road and bridge closures and train and ferry cancellations.

Several schools were also closed as winds reached up to 90mph in exposed areas, bringing damage to buildings and disruption to power supplies.

Forecasters warn that further disruption is likely today as the adverse weather continues.

The Met Office has issued amber "be prepared" wind warnings across the whole country into this morning, as well as yellow "be aware" warnings for rain in the Highlands, Strathclyde, Central Scotland, Tayside and Fife.

Some of the warnings are expected to remain in place until later tonight.

The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) has also issued 41 flood alerts and warnings.

Minister for Transport Derek Mackay said: "This latest period of unsettled weather is likely to cause familiar problems for travellers across the country with disruption to ferry and rail services likely.

"The gale force winds that are forecast are also likely to make travelling conditions particularly difficult for high-sided vehicles and we have already seen restrictions and even some full closures of bridges, with further disruption probable.

"Travellers are advised to take care in difficult conditions and allow extra time for their journeys. People should continue to check radio reports, visit the Traffic Scotland website or twitter feed, check with their transport operator, and take the latest police advice before setting off.

"High winds can also cause disruption to utilities like power and telecoms and key responder organisations across Scotland, including councils, utilities and blue light services, are well used to dealing with severe weather events such as these forecast.

"We have ensured that they have put in place the necessary planning and response arrangements to deal with any impacts as quickly and effectively as possible, nevertheless, people should try to ensure that they are prepared, including checking on the elderly and vulnerable."

The latest storm comes just days after Storm Gertrude brought gusts in excess of 100mph, as well as heavy rain and snow.

The Forth Road Bridge was closed to all traffic for a period yesterday, before being reopened for all but high-sided vehicles.

Road maintenance body BEAR Scotland said its teams were on "high alert", adding that the Skye, Kessock, Dornach and Cromarty bridges were all likely to close overnight, while a number of road closures were also in place.

Eddie Ross, the agency's North West Unit representative, said: "We are doing everything possible to keep roads open however high winds and heavy rain is continuing to affect trunk roads and for safety a number of vehicle restrictions have been implemented by Police Scotland on some routes.

"Severe weather conditions are continuing so we advise motorists to take extra care on roads, always ensuring to drive to conditions and to plan ahead where possible by checking the Traffic Scotland website for up-to-date information."

The wind is expected to settle as today goes on, but further outbreaks of heavy rain are expected throughout the day.

Tomorrow is expected to be a more settled day, but forecaster have put further warnings for heavy rain in place for parts of the country on Thursday and Friday.
