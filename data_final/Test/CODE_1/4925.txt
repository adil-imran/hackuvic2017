Mos for Defence Subhas Bhamre asserted that it was Islamabad's habit to deflect, adding that India did not need their 'certificate' as everyone knows that it was behind the attack.

With Islamabad rejecting New Delhi's claims that it was involved in the deadly attack in Uri, where 17 Army soldiers lost their lives, Minister of State for Defence Subhash Bhamre on Monday asserted that India did not need Pakistan's clarifications, as their involvement in the terror strike was concrete.

Speaking to ANI here, Bhamre stated that given the current tense situation across the nation following the attack, the Centre is gearing up to give a fitting response to Pakistan. "The entire nation is traumatised right now as we lost 17 brave soldiers. No condemnation is enough for this cowardly act. The whole nation is united in this hour of grief. The Prime Minister, Home Minister and Defence Minister have all come to the conclusion that a response needs to be given to Pakistan," he said.

Talking about Pakistan washing its hands off the charges of being involved in the attack, Bhamre asserted that it was Islamabad's habit to deflect, adding that India did not need their 'certificate' as everyone knows that it was behind the attack.

Confirming the death toll of the tragedy to be at 17, he stated that most of the injured are suffering from severe burns and are being treated in the Valley itself, but three injured soldiers were brought to the RR Army Hospital here. Earlier in a statement, the Army said that a group of heavily armed terrorists targeted the rear administrative base of a unit at Uri on Sunday early morning, and in the counter action, four terrorists were eliminated. "The administrative base had large strength of troops of units turning over after their tour of duty who were stationed in tents/temporary shelters which caught fire, and resulted in heavy casualties.

We salute the sacrifice of 17 soldiers who were martyred in the operation," the statement added.

Condemning the terror attack in Uri Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured the nation that those behind the 'despicable' attack will not go unpunished. "We salute all those martyred in Uri. Their service to the nation will always be remembered. My thoughts are with the bereaved families," the Prime Minister said in a series of tweets.

Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh has hit out at Pakistan branding it as a 'terrorist state', adding that he was disappointed by Islamabad's continued support to terrorism and terrorist groups.

Branding Pakistan as a 'terrorist state' and stating that it should be identified and isolated as such, the Home Minister added that there are definite and conclusive indications that the perpetrators of Uri attack were highly trained, heavily armed and specially equipped. "I am deeply disappointed with Pakistan's continued and direct support to terrorism and terrorist groups," he said in a series of tweets.

However, Pakistan has flatly refused New Delhi's claims of Islamabad's involvement in Uri terror attack, stating that said that pointing fingers on them has become a traditional tendency of India after each terrorist attack.

"Pointing fingers at Pakistan has become a traditional tendency of India after each terrorist attack," the Dawn quoted Pakistan Foreign Office spokesperson Nafees Zakaria as saying.

"In the past many Indians were involved in the terrorist acts for which India had blamed Pakistan," he asserted.

In one of the worst attack in recent times, at least 17 soldiers lost their lives and 30 others injured post the terror strike on an army camp close to the headquarters of the 12th Brigade at Uri in Baramulla district. All four terrorists have been killed in what has emerged as worse than the attack on the Pathankot air base earlier in January this year, in which seven army men were killed.

Director General of Military operation Lt. Ranbir Singh yesterday said that the four terrorists, who attacked the military base in Jammu and Kashmir's Uri, belonged to Pakistan's banned terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). During his briefing to media persons, Singh said that four AK 47 rifles, four Under Barrel Grenade Launchers and other war like stores have been recovered from the militants.
