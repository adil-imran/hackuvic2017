Mindanao the next militant battle ground

Mindanao could yet be the next battleground for militants and their usual advocacy. In the last Kidapawan killing of 2 farmer rallies and one policeman in coma, the same provocative tricks like the other militant massacres in the north could now be transported to Mindanao.



The manila anti-riot police are now experts in maximum tolerance so the militants could no longer penetrate their strategies of provocation.



But provocation during rallies is something new in Mindanao and their riot police should learn fast from their manila counter parts otherwise, Mindanao could be the next scene of bloodshed in the streets.



It is so easy to provoke in-experienced anti-riot policemen so that they should have more and more trainings for maximum tolerance during rallies.



With the Duterte syndrome, militancy could migrate to Mindanao to provoke neophyte Duterte anti riot police if Duterte wins the presidency. And the Kidapawan killings is just the fitst experiment.



Militants could not provoke the Hacienda Luisita Farmers anymore. Mindiola demonstrations also the same. The Visayas is not yet ripe for such because of its diversity of islands. Mindnano could be the next target of activistâ€™s militancy and the police better brace themselves for more to come.
