President Barack Obama made a joke with unfortunately bad timing Saturday, quipping that the Islamic State was no big deal compared to his birth certificate, only to have America hit by two separate explosions.

While addressing a dinner held by the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Saturday night, Obama joked about Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s recent declaration that Obama was, in fact, born in America.

“I don’t know about you guys, but I am so relieved that the whole birther thing is over,” Obama said. “I mean, ISIL, North Korea, poverty, climate change, none of those things weighed on my mind like the validity of my birth certificate.”

Unfortunately, at almost the same time Obama made his remarks, the Chelsea neighborhood was rocked by an explosion that injured at least 25 people. New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio said the explosion was “an intentional act,” and authorities reportedly found a second, undetonated pressure cooker device on a nearby street.

Astonishingly, the Chelsea blast was the second explosion of the day. A Marine Corps charity race in New Jersey was hit by a pipe bomb that thankfully left no injuries, and a subsequent investigation discovered additional devices.

Meanwhile, in St. Cloud, Minnesota, an attacker reportedly motivated by Islamic radicalism was shot dead after wounding eight shoppers with a knife.

The culprit, or culprits, for both bombing incidents haven’t been found yet, but ISIS has encouraged supporters to make attacks within the United States. Last June’s deadly massacre in Orlando was perpetrated by Omar Mateen, who declared his support for ISIS during the attack.
