Leading figures are calling for Chancellor Angela Merkel to introduce facial recognition software to spot potential threats in transport hubs - including airports and train stations. In an interview Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said politicians want to see the introduction of the new measures as soon as possible. He said: "I would like to use this kind of facial recognition technology in video cameras at airports and train stations. "Then, if a suspect appears and is recognised, it will show up in the system."

Mr De Maiziere said a ban on rucksacks at large-scale public gatherings will help, adding that it would be up to on-site security officials to take that decision. He said: ‚ÄùWe will have to get used to increased security measures, such as longer queues, stricter checks or personal entry cards. "This is tedious, uncomfortable and costs time but I don't think it's a limitation of personal freedom." Security threats are a growing concern at local and national levels after sustained coordinated attacks across Europe in the last year.

Attacks on trains, in airports and in public places have caused chaos and hundreds of deaths. In the UK, police forces became one of the world's first to deploy automated facial recognition technology to catch criminals in 2014. Company NEC which makes the software NeoFace Watch says there is increased demand for their services as a result of the trial. In a report it stated: "With the threats to international borders, governments are ordering reviews of their security arrangements at airports, seaports and public transportation hubs. "Law enforcement agencies are also charged with identifying wanted individuals in public places. "In addition, security and facilities managers need to keep known undesirables and unknowns off their premises.
