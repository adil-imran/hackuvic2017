Governor Kashim Shettima of Borno State has ordered the digging of about two kilometer trenches around Ali Dawari village to check incessant attacks on residents by the terror sect Boko Haram.

Troops are also to be deployed to the area for effective patrol of the farming community, a mere four kilometres south of Maiduguri, the state capital.

Gov. Shettima who was in the village yesterday to pay condolences to the people over last Sunday’s attack in which about 24 people were killed pledged that security agents would ensure 24hrs patrol in the community.

“This is our land and there is no fear to run or retreat and by God’s willing, all the necessary measures to be taken will be implemented to protect lives and property in this village,” the governor said.

“Right now, we are going to dig trenches on the northern flank of AlinDawari. Soldiers and other security personnel and members of Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) will also be deployed to the village to protect it from these lunatics,” he said.

The governor, speaking during an interaction with journalists, explained further, “We have just discussed with the villagers and their Head; and now their demands on how to secure them will be met, particularly their security of lives and property.

“The villagers told me that once there is security, they are willing and ready to return before the end of this week. And right now I have come along with the Garrison Commander of the military, who will deploy more soldiers to this village.

“Also I have discussed with the Borno State Deputy Commissioner of Police to deploy more policemen. And it is equally with the CJTF, which will volunteer to deploy 50-100 of its members to Ali Dawari for day and night patrols.

“These villagers are our people. We have been elected to protect and improve their living conditions. It is not only during electioneering campaigns that we visit the people. They now need our presence as we live there at the Government House, Maiduguri. “There was no reason why we should not come here to commiserate and sympathize with them; and make sure we wipe off their tears.”

“The most important thing is that those Boko Haram insurgents are not demons; they are people like us here in this state.

“Since this is our land, we have no any other place to flee or run. And the most important thing was that we are more sincere than the insurgents. God is always with anyone that exercises patience and endurance,” Gov. Shettima explained.

The village Head, Bulama Mallam informed Gov. Shettima that the villagers are leaving in droves since the attack, “If there is security in the village, my people will return before the end of next week; without any fear or hesitation.”
