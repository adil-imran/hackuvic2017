The Central Bureau of Investigation’s ongoing inquiry into the “bribe for favourable tax assessment” scam has touched the top echelons of the Income Tax department in Kerala.

In its First Information Report (FIR) filed in the CBI Special Court here, the agency has named Chief Commissioner of Income Tax Anil Goel as a prime suspect in the graft case.

The report (RC 18 (A)/2015) has offered an unflattering portrait of the IT department.

It has indicated how a network of shady chartered accountants, powerful businessmen and corrupt IT assessors dominated the department and made it, arguably, a symbol of sleaze in public eye.

The other accused are Balachandran, owner of a textile showroom in the capital, his auditor, K.I. Koshy and Sarat, an IT officer. The CBI’s case was that in September last the suspect IT officers “entered into criminal conspiracy to collect illegal gratification from various high value IT assessees under their jurisdiction.”

The agency alleged that Mr. Goel met Mr. Koshy in his office and “threatened to order an IT survey” on Mr. Balachandran’s new showroom and “in order to avoid the same demanded Rs.15 lakh.”

He allegedly directed Mr. Koshy to meet Mr. Sarat and “settle the matter in consultation” with him.

The “demand for Rs. 15 lakh was reduced to Rs. 10 lakh and the money was delivered to Mr. Sarat for onward transfer to Mr. Goel,” the CBI alleged.

The CBI told the court that the suspect officers had “negotiated with a number of business firms, their auditors and proprietors and collected huge amounts of bribe” to protect the businesses “in matters pertaining to their IT assessment.”

It alleged that on at least three occasions in September/October 2015, the IT officials had transferred Rs.29 lakh to Mr. Goel’s wife, Juhi Goel, in Mumbai. (The CBI has named her a suspect in the case).

They “threatened IT payers under their jurisdiction with adverse action to facilitate the illegal transfer of the tainted money from Thiruvananthapuram to Mumbai,” the investigating agency said.
