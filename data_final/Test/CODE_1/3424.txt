Yesterday, the Supreme Court of India took a landmark decision to allow a 24-year-old rape survivor to terminate a 24-week pregnancy, as the foetus has abnormalities, and going ahead would severely affect the woman's health. Why is it a landmark judgement? Because after 20 weeks of pregnancy a woman in India is not allowed by law to abort a foetus. Even if the unborn baby is the result of a rape.

Though the 45-year-old law is being questioned by activists countrywide--with a petition of altering the law, raising the ceiling of choice already underway--it becomes pertinent for all women (married and unmarried) and men to know what they're getting themselves into when planning to abort a child in India.

Till when can you get the child aborted?



Abortion in India is legal only up to 20 weeks of pregnancy, under specific conditions and situations, which are defined as:

* If the continuance of pregnancy risks the life of the woman or may result in grave physical or mental injury.

* If there is a substantial possibility of the child being born with physical or mental abnormalities, as to be seriously handicapped.

Types of abortion in India

There are two types of abortion treatments available in India:

Medical abortion: This type of abortion involves just popping a pill to incite an early miscarriage. This is an option for women who are 10 weeks (or less) pregnant. For a medical abortion after 10 weeks--and up to 24 weeks--the medication available causes the womb to contract and push out the pregnancy.

Surgical abortion: As the name suggests, surgical abortion involves surgically removing the foetus and placenta from the woman's womb. There are two types of surgical abortions:

*Vacuum aspiration (recommended only for the first trimester): Removes the pregnancy by gentle suction, after being administered a local anaesthetic.

*Dilation and evacuation (recommended for the second trimester): A combination of vacuum aspiration, dilation and curettage and the use of surgical instruments (such as forceps) to clear the uterus of foetal and placental tissue.

Who has the right to abort?

The pregnant woman has the right to adopt; she does not need anyone's acknowledgement or support if she's above 18 years of age and is mentally stable.

* If a woman is married, her own written consent is sufficient. Her husband's consent is not required.

* If a woman is unmarried and over 18 years of age, she can provide her own written consent.

* If a woman is unmarried and under 18, she must provide written consent from her guardian/parent.

* If a woman is mentally unstable, a written consent is required from her guardian/parent.
