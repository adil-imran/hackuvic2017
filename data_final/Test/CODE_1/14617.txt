Members of a Bath church have returned from their 20th visit to a bomb-hit area of Pakistan.

St Philip and St James church visited the victims who witnessed suicide bombings at All Saints Church Peshawar three year ago.

More than 120 people were killed in the massacre in 2013 and the combined St Philip's Peshawar team have since brought medical relief and post-trauma counselling to those affected.

Among the targets was the Army Public School where a further 140 school children were massacred by gunmen. Altogether the church has supported 200 victims of the bombings in the Pakistan church.



The Rev Alan Bain and his team leader Qamar Rafiq in Pakistan, also from Twerton, set up the project in November 2013 and launched an appeal among Bath churches to bring relief to the bombing victims.

Since then the appeal has raised more than Â£27,000 and funded 13 visits to deliver medical supplies and for post-trauma counselling workshops.

Rev Bain said " We launched the appeal to bring relief in a desperate situation. I felt we had the contacts and the resources to help the victims of the bombings who had seen their families blown up in front of them as they went to church. I knew we could help, and the people in Bath churches stepped in generously to make it possible. It's been something of a pilgrimage to recognise that we can all do a lot more in these desperate situations than we often think."
