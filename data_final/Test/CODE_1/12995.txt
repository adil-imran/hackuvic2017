Cool FM’s On-Air Personality, OAP, Freeze has expressed his opinion regarding the recent massacre in an Enugu community by suspected Fulani herdsmen.

DAILY POST recalls that the herdsmen on Monday invaded Ukpabi, Nimbo in Uzo-Uwani Local Government Area of Enugu State, armed with dangerous weapons.

They stormed the town in their numbers in the morning, reportedly shooting at any person in sight.

The attack left scores slaughtered and others sustained varying degrees of injuries on the head, neck, and other parts of the body, who are currently receiving treatment in different hospitals in Nsukka.

Reacting to the deadly attack, the radio host, in an open letter, stated that the military needs to step in and implement stiff measures so that things do not degenerate.

The broadcaster described the recent attack in Enugu as “heinous and sickening” to say the least.

He wrote: “I hereby offer my deepest condolence to my brothers and sisters, the Igbo people.

“The slaughter in Enugu was heinous to say the least, and to imagine that such an act could occur in 2016 is sickening. However, the Fulani herdsmen are not after the Igbo people, like some are trying to insinuate, by whipping up sentiment to incite and instigate people.

“They are against anyone who doesn’t rear cows. They are a menace and should be stopped by all means necessary, including a ‘shoot at sight’ military order if the situation requires.

“Nonetheless, we should take into cognizance that not every Hausa or Fulani man is our enemy, and even they are at the mercy of these cattle herdsmen.

“The Fulani people are estimated at 40 million according to Adeyiga Adebayo, whose detailed report on this menace can be found online.

This is the opportunity some people have been waiting for to divide Nigeria and with sentimental manipulation through propaganda, they are slowly but surely getting there.

“However, if our search is for a solution instead of whom to blame, then we MUST stand together as a country to fight this menace!”
