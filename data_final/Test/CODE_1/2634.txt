It’s not only Faroese sweaters that have enjoyed a boom in sales since The Killing. Since BBC4’s Danish import arrived on British screens four years ago, viewers have embraced a steady stream of foreign language dramas. Almost two million tuned in for The Bridge; Saturday night ratings for series three, aired in the run-up to Christmas on BBC4, were topped only by BBC1 and ITV.

But the flood of Scandi noir, including Wallander and Arne Dahl, has also broadened to include other genres, from Sky Arts’ Swedish counselling comedy Dag to Channel 4’s existential Gallic zombie drama The Returned. On 3 January, a wealth of new foreign shows will be made available, packaged box-set style and free to view, on Walter Presents, part of Channel 4’s on demand hub All4.

Casting its net a little wider than normal, Walter Presents will showcase dramas from territories including Poland, Argentina and the Czech Republic, with a target of accumulating more than 600 hours of programming. And with Netflix and Amazon also buying up foreign drama, there will be plenty of choice in 2016.

Germany: Deutschland 83 (Channel 4/Walter Presents)

It’s 1983, and the Berlin Wall looks impregnable. The United States and the Soviet Union are rattling their sabres and accelerating the arms race, and a divided Germany is caught in the middle. As tensions mount, a hero is needed to keep the peace. Enter Martin Rauch. Or should that be Moritz Stamm?

A wry spy caper, Deutschland 83 follows Martin, a (fictional) young Stasi agent who is sent undercover in West Germany – as Moritz – to recover Nato’s strategic secrets after Ronald Reagan’s line-in-the-sand Evil Empire speech prompts concerns behind the Iron Curtain that the west is planning an attack.

Created by a British-American husband and wife team, the drama offers a chilling new slant on the cold war. The pair were inspired by an article in the Guardian, about the real events of Able Archer, a little-known military exercise that brought an unsuspecting world to the brink of nuclear armageddon.

The show’s young star Jonas Nay is a highly appealing combination of world weary spy and wide-eyed cultural tourist as Martin – young and inexperienced, dazzled and bewildered by the temptations and depravities of consumerism. As much a coming-of-age drama as a thriller – with seductive 80s fetishism from 99 Red Balloons to gleaming white trainers thrown in –Deutschland 83 may not be subtle, but it is a blast.

France: Marseille (Netflix, 2016)

It’s standard practice for broadcasters to promote new series with meaningless shorthand comparisons to other series . Marseille’s creator Dan Franck has dubbed his new eight-parter “House of Cards in French”.

It is actually something far more intriguing. Rather than the familiar turf of presidential politics in the capital, Marseille plays out in a vivid, complex city that has been underused on screen since The French Connection exposed its gruesome underbelly. Robert Taro, mayor of the city for the past 25 years, faces a formidable opponent in the upcoming elections: the predatory fixer he anointed his heir. Their ensuing battle royale proves very dirty indeed, dragging in unions, drug lords and powerbrokers.

And then there’s the casting. Cast your mind back, and Gerard Depardieu used to be a pretty good actor. Netflix will be hoping they can coax him into producing magic on screen as a dissolute, complacent politician living on past glories. His young rival is played by Benoit Magimel, best known as Isabelle Huppert’s pupil in Michael Haneke’s The Piano Teacher.

Netflix’s track record with subtitled series isn’t spotless (Narcos: good, Marco Polo: not so much), but, as Spiral and The Returned have proven, French television is en plein forme so there’s every reason to be hopeful.

Denmark: Follow the Money (BBC4, early 2016)



The phrase “Danish economic thriller” may not set the pulse racing, but then neither did “30-episode Copenhagen political drama” or “Danish exploration of the Schleswig-Holstein affair”. The latest venture from Danish state broadcaster DR uses the post-crash economy to explore dodgy dealings in the green energy industry. When a body turns up near an offshore windfarm belonging to renowned renewable energy company Energreen, its eccentric, media-savvy two-wheeling CEO is embroiled in a grubby tale of corporate malfeasance, double cross and (of course) murder.

Follow the Money creators Anders August and Jeppe Gjervig Gram were respectively involved in The Legacy and Borgen, while the casting pits one Dogme 95 alumnus (Nikolaj Lie Kaas of Brothers, playing the mogul, Sander) against another (Festen’s Thomas Bo Larsen, as Mads, the financial fraud detective on his case). Aficionados of Nordic noir should not be disappointed by the tone or the world-weary copper who, producer Anders Toft Andersen suggests, is “a sort of hero, seeking justice in a universe where there isn’t any”.

Follow the Money is imperfect but the plotting is slick and clever. A second series has already been commissioned.

Belgium: Clan (Walter Presents, February)

Thanks to Hercule Poirot, nothing feels more Belgian than a whodunnit. But here’s something a little different: a howdunnit. Clan opens at the funeral of the unpopular Jean-Claude Delcorps – dubbed “the prick” by his family and “a despicable turtle’s fart” by his business associates. His four sisters-in-law have been conspiring to bump him off for some time.

The drama, like so many European TV imports of recent years, features women at its heart. As two insurance investigators – desperate to avoid the life insurance payout that would bankrupt their ailing firm – get on the case of Delcorps’ death, Clan depicts the slide of a bland small town into a hive of frustrated ambition, festering resentment and homicidal intent.

It is an interesting addition to the strictly generic Flemish series we have seen to date on BBC4 – conspiracy thriller Salamander and apocalyptic Cordon – and also taps into Belgium’s cinematic lineage of brutally dark comedies, from Kill Me Please to Man Bites Dog. An American remake is now under way.

South Korea: It’s OK, That’s Love (no UK broadcaster)

Romantic comedy My Lovely Sam-Soon, with its sympathetic focus on a dowdy twentysomething woman, broke new ground for Korean drama, while sweeping 16th-century costume drama Dae Jang Geum was exported to 92 countries. But Britain has been slower to embrace foreign-language programmes from outside Europe.

It’s OK, That’s Love could be the show to break through. Ji Jae Soo (Gong Hyo-jin), a psychiatrist with her own deep-seated, undiagnosed conditions, gradually falls for her patient Jang Jae Yeol (Jo In-sung), a novelist with OCD and schizophrenia. Initially light and comedic, it deepens along with their relationship, and they are forced to confront their own unresolved problems. Smart characterisation, clever direction and a very fine soundtrack of credible K-Pop ensure the abiding sense of optimism never tips over into sugarcoating the serious issues it addresses.

It’s OK, That’s Love defied the cultural stigmatisation of mental illness in a country with one of the world’s highest suicide rates – and proved a huge hit with younger viewers, relieved to find a series prepared to say the unsayable. While that may not mean it is a novelty in the UK, it makes it no less affecting or memorable.
