and ammunition in mid-July a day after his wife called police for a domestic dispute

New details emerged today about the murder-suicide of a Pennsylvania family, including how the husband bought a gun a day after his wife called police telling them she was scared of him.

The Berks County district attorney says that three weeks later, Mark Short Sr, 40, used the .38-caliber handgun to kill his wife of 16 years, Megan Short, 33, and their three children, Liana, eight, Mark Jr, five, Willow, two.

The kids were found dead alongside their parents August 6 in the family's home in Sinking Spring, Pennsylvania.

New details: Mark Short, 44 (right), bought a handgun used in the August 6 murder-suicide that claimed the lives of his family a day after his wife, Megan Short (left), 33, called police telling them she was scared of her husband of 16 years

Police discovered the family members dead of gunshot wounds in the living room after a relative expressed concern that Megan Short had not shown for a lunch date. A dog also was found dead.

Investigators found a one-page handwritten murder-suicide note and a handgun near Mark Short, but collected forensic evidence and performed an autopsy before ruling him the shooter.

According to police, Short appeared to have written the letter after he killed his family and acknowledged having bought the gun and using it to commit the murders.

District Attorney John Adams said the couple had been having domestic issues, and during a July 18 call to the house after a domestic dispute, police informed Megan Short how to seek a protection from abuse order.

The prosecutor said when officers responded to the Shorts' home, Mark was not there. His wife told them she was scared of him, reported Philly.com.

Authorities said the following day, Mark Short went to a Lancaster County gun store and purchased a handgun and bullets that he used in the shootings a few weeks later. Megan Short never sought a protection order.

The day before the murders, Mr Short took his children to the HersheyPark amusement park without his wife as part of a family day sponsored by his employer.

Adams said authorities could not speculate on a motive that prompted Mark Short to kill his family, but said he and his wife were in the middle of ending their marriage after 16 years, separating houses and that he'd been demoted in his job as a loan officer at the start of August.

'I don't know that we know specifically as to why this relationship had disintegrated. We don't have any answers to that,' Adams said. 'Suffice it to say based upon our investigation ... we can tell you he was going through a breakup of a marriage and he was emotional about that, but that's all we can tell you.'

Megan had publicly mentioned plans to leave her husband, saying he had abused her for 16 years, a woman close to Megan told the Reading Eagle.

Willow (pictured), the family's youngest child, survived a heart transplant two years before she was killed along with her parents and two siblings on Saturday, August 6

Angie Burke, who lived on the same street as the Short family, posted a link to a story about domestic abuse, titled: 'He didn't hit me. It was still abuse' on Facebook.

In the story, published by the Washington Post, author Leigh Stein recounts her experience at the hands of an emotionally abusive boyfriend.

Short commented on Burke's Facebook page on July 23: 'It really does a number on your mental health for sure,' according to Burke.

She then wrote: 'This is why I am leaving my marriage Angie. 16 years,' the Reading Eagle reported.

The family appeared happy in Facebook photos (the father and children pictured above) and a neighbor said: 'I never would have suspected there were any issues'

Burke showed screen grabs from the conversation to the newspaper, in which Megan mentioned having found a rental.

Short then posted on Facebook about a week ago, asking for people to help her move out of her home on August 6, Burke said.

Burke knew Short after both attended neighborhood events such as Christmas and Halloween parties, and both kept in touch via Facebook.

District Attorney John Adams called the fatal shooting of all family members 'an apparent tragic domestic incident' last week.

The family's youngest child, Willow, had received a pioneering heart transplant when she was just six days old in 2014.

Authorities discovered the grisly scene in the small town in Berks County on Winding Brook Drive in the Brookfield Manor subdivision, according to ABC 6.

The killings happened on August 6 and the bodies of the parents and three children were discovered around 3pm in the living room.

Police went to the home to check on the welfare of the family after receiving a call from a relative concerned that the woman had not shown up for a lunch date.

Authorities found a handgun near one of the adults but did not say which one or who they believe was the shooter. A dog also was found dead.

A handwritten note that 'appeared to be a 'murder-suicide' note' was found in the family's Sinking Spring home on the afternoon of August 6, District Attorney John Adams said.

The district attorney's office said the married couple had been having 'domestic issues.'

'This is an apparent tragic domestic incident,' Adams said on Sunday. 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families at this difficult time.'

The Berks County District Attorney's office is leading an investigation into the deaths with assistance from police from Sinking Spring and Spring Township.

Willow (pictured as a baby) had a heart transplant when she was just six days old. Her family had been featured in news articles about her condition

The family had previously been featured in articles in The Reading Eagle and The New York Times about Willow's condition, and their difficulties obtaining anti-rejection medication for her.

Megan often wrote about the struggles her family faced with getting the drug on a Facebook page for The Waiting List, an organ donation advocacy group.

A story published in October 2014 in The Reading Eagle detailed Willow's heart journey from her birth on May 6, 2014 at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

Willow was five months old at the time and had undergone the heart transplant. Her condition was improving.

She had suffered from a variation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, a rare congenital birth defect, according to the newspaper.

During her mother's pregnancy, her parents learned their daughter's heart was not fully formed and could not pump blood efficiently, threatening her life.

Her mother (pictured above holding Willow for the first time post-transplant) often wrote about the struggles her family faced with getting anti-rejection drugs

When Willow was three days old, she underwent her first open-heart surgery as doctors worked to repair her left ventricle and redirect her circulation.

During surgery, doctors found a tunnel defect and following the procedure, she bled so much she required 16 blood transfusions.

She was placed on a heart-and-lung bypass machine and was added to the National Transplant List, with her survival depending on a donation of another baby's heart.

The parents were told there could be a three-to-six month wait and prepared for their baby girl to not survive the wait.

However, another heart became available three days later and Willow went into surgery six days after her birth.

The transplant was described as a 'remarkable success' and by May 29, Willow's heart was working so well doctors removed her from oxygen.

She was released on June 26, 2014, according to The Reading Eagle.

At the time of her transplant, Willow was one of just three infants to have a heart transplant that year at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia by July 31, 2014.

American doctors have successfully performed infant heart transplants since the mid-1980s, however the procedures are rare, the newspaper reported.

In 2014, only 64 babies under the age of one had received a heart transplant through July 31, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.

Nearly a year after Willow's transplant, Megan wrote a post on The Waiting List of one of her memories.

'Willow's first wail was the most beautiful sound I had ever heard, but it didn't take long before she was intubated within hours of her birth and I could no longer hear her voice,' the mother-of-three wrote.

'It was so difficult to see her upset. But not be able to hear her cry, it was heartbreaking.

'After her transplant, doctors were able to remove the breathing tube.

'Hearing her voice and seeing her face without all the tape is one of my favorite memories.'

Earlier posts on the Facebook page detail Willow's condition from some of her anti-rejection levels being too high to battling pneumonia, viruses, fevers and infections.

Other posts gave updates celebrating time would go by without Willow having any hospitalizations or cardiology visits.

In a July 2015 story published in The New York Times, it detailed the family's struggle with getting medication for Willow.

At the time of the story was published, Megan was 32 years old and Willow was a year old.

The article talked about how Willow could not afford to miss a single dose of a drug she took daily to prevent her body from rejecting her recently transplanted heart.

However, it noted that due to rules from the family's drug plan and the pharmacy, the mother could not order a refill until Willow's monthly supply was three-quarters gone.

But to process a refill, the article said it took about seven days which was risky because it was hard to know whether a new shipment would arrive before the old one ran out.

'You just feel like every month, you're hoping that they don't mess it up,' Short told the newspaper, which went on to focus on the concept of a 'specialty pharmacy.'

The newspaper described the concept as 'a new breed of drug dispensary that has arisen to handle the exploding number of medicines that cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars a year and are used to treat complex or rare diseases.'

The story included a photo of the family as they released balloons that May to celebrate the first anniversary of Willow's heart transplant.

In one December Facebook post, Mark (pictured with his wife and their three children) wrote that his wife was 'still the most beautiful girl' he had ever met

Along with documenting her experience with having a child with a heart transplant, Megan also described her struggles with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

The mother wrote in a blog post in April about how having a child born with a severe congenital heart defect was the most significant shift of her life.

She wrote: 'I was so focused on learning everything I could to keep my child alive and to minimize the impact on my other children that I didn't see the full impact that it had on me.'

She described her anxieties over being able to care for her child without doctors and nurses by her side at home and getting used to giving Willow 15 different medicines around the clock.

She also said she suffered from 'anxiety and nightmares' triggered by smells, hallways or even the beeping sound of a phone.

'I remember sitting up at night just watching her sleep because I was terrified that I placed her NG tube in her lungs and was slowly drowning her,' she wrote.

'I then isolated myself from the world worried that any little germ would kill her.'

Megan (pictured right in September 2014 with the rest of the family) also described her struggles with post traumatic stress disorder

The mother noted she experienced 'survivor's guilt' when children with similar problems from other families passed away.

However, she said with time things got easier as she became more confident in the medical aspect of caring for Willow, but noted the trauma never goes away.

She described having nightmares and triggering events, noting it took her nearly two years to recognized how she was impacted by these experiences.

'I don't think PTSD ever truly goes away but, with therapy, medication, and the right support, I have begun to loosen its grip on me,' she wrote.

'As I work on my own mental healing, I wanted to share my experience so that other heart parents know they are not alone.'

According to The Reading Eagle, the couple had been advocates for organ donation since 2012.

Following the deaths on August 6, a neighbor told The Reading Eagle they 'never would've suspected there were any issues.'
