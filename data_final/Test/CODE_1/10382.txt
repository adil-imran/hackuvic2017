FROM HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES REPORTS TO DEFENDING FREEDOM OF SPEECH TO

RIGHTS-BASED JOURNALISM



SOME of you perhaps may be mystified or puzzled about why I have included the

term ‘mindful’ journalism in the title of this presentation. I’ll explain later

on as we get into this keynote talk. But for the moment, let’s call it part of

a global attempt to reintroduce “ethics” and “compassion” into journalism, and

why this is important in a human rights context.



and perhaps in the West nowhere as seriously as in France on two occasions last

year and Brussels last month. After the earlier massacre of some 12 people in

the attack on the satirical magazine

defence of freedom of speech symbolised by the hashtag

Charlie. Human rights has taken a battering in recent times across the world,and perhaps in the West nowhere as seriously as in France on two occasions lastyear and Brussels last month. After the earlier massacre of some 12 people inthe attack on the satirical magazine CharlieHebdo in January, there was a massive wave of rallies in defiance and indefence of freedom of speech symbolised by the hashtag #JeSuisCharlie – I amCharlie.

Investigators in both Belgium and France worked on the links between

the two series of attacks and have made a breakthrough in arresting two key

figures alleged to be at the heart of the conspiracy, Salah Abdeslam and

Mohamed Abrini, a 31-year-old Belgian-Morrocan suspected to be the “man in the

hat” responsible for the bomb that didn’t go off at Brussels airport.

It ought to be noted that Charlie’s

cartoons were not just anti-Muslim, or rather critical of jihadist extremism,

they have been equally offensive about all religious, mocking Christian

extremists and the establishment with just as much fervour. Barely had the

French nation come to terms over this terrible and senseless massacre in

January, which killed the chief cartoonist editor, known as Charb, and most of

the cartooning team in one foul swoop, when an even more horrendous event

happened 10 months later with a series of simultaneous attacks by masked ISIS

gunmen across several locations in Paris, killing 135 people.

In the West, there was a rise of gratuitous insults and hostile

anti-Muslim feelings, which was precisely one of the objectives of the ISIS

gunmen. (Islamic State should be called Daesh – it is not a country). The whole

point of terrorism is to strike terror in the hearts of your opponents.

But few stopped to think about the origins of terror, or the traditions

of torture and state terrorism in the West that stretch back to the Inquisition

in 1234 and the massacre of whole communities, such as the famous rugby playing

town Béziers in southern France. An army

of crusaders under orders from then Pope Innocent III attacked the city on 22

July 1209 and slaughtered some 20,000 people, many of them inside churches.

They were regarded as Cathar heretics.

Moving on a few centuries to colonial Algeria, France fought a bitter

war against the Muslim rebels (1954-1962), reaching fever pitch in the Battle

of Algiers when a Second World War resistance hero led brutal and illegal

counter-terrorism methods to crush the resistance in the Casbah. The battle for

the city was won, but ultimately France lost the independence war.



as one of the greatest movies of all time, was banned in France for five years.

Lieutenant-Colonel Mathieu is a composite character based on Colonel Jacques

Massu, the paratrooper commander. It shows how the West developed illegal

torture and terrorist methods against the Algerians. This is at the root of the

US “terrorism against terrorism” military methods today.

South Pacific with French military suppression of Kanak agitation for

independence and with the

cartoon by celebrated Le Monde cartoonist Plantu shows up the paranoia,

hypocrisy and violation of human rights at the time. More about that later. Shades of this repression were echoed barely 20 years later in theSouth Pacific with French military suppression of Kanak agitation forindependence and with the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior in 1985. Acartoon by celebratedcartoonist Plantu shows up the paranoia,hypocrisy and violation of human rights at the time. More about that later.

Terrorism and violation of human rights today impacts on many

communities across the world, including throughout the Middle East.

Is there massive change in the air? The Arab Spring optimism in 2011 led

to disillusionment and gross violations of human rights in Egypt, Libya, Syria

and in Tunisia where the pro-democracy movement began.

But then back to France where there has been the growing Nuit Debout – “Up

all Night” — movement that launched in Paris on March 31 and then spread across

60 cities in Europe last weekend. Protesters with one rally up to

120,000-strong demonstrated in all-night vigils against austerity,

globalisation, increasing inequality, privatisation and the continent’s harsh

anti-migrant policies. An uprising against neoliberalism.

Let us step back for the moment and view human rights at a distance

from some of the world’s trouble spots. I want to jump across to our own

Pacific backyard and take you to Australia and show you a little cameo from the

“Climate Angels”. Five of the demonstrators, all women aged in their 50s and

70s, were arrested a few weeks ago over a sit-in protest at a Santos coal seam

gas development near Narrabri, northern New South Wales.

June Norman, a feisty 75-year-old, who took part in a protest walk

across East Timor in 2013 to the town of Balibo, site of the massacre of five

journalists, was forcibly dragged away first. This video was taken by a citizen

journalist “bearing witness”.



that is at the centre of the biggest leak of confidential financial data in the

history of journalism: Mossack Fonseca. Right in the heart of the capital of Panama is the office of a law firmthat is at the centre of the biggest leak of confidential financial data in thehistory of journalism: Mossack Fonseca. The so-called Panama Papers have exposed

a global web of 214,000 offshore shell companies, involving heads of state,

athletes, financial institutions and criminals.

The point is that human rights can be violated anywhere in the world,

and too often there are no witnesses or visual evidence to tell the true story.

On the other hand, social media has dramatically exposed some of the murkier human

rights episodes of today.

So now to Human Rights in the Pacific: In the short time that I have

available today, I am going to give a sweeping snapshot of some of the issues

that I think are important in the region. I have six topic headings:

1.

Asylum seekers, refugees – “outsourcing” by Australia to Nauru and

Manus Island, PNG

2.

Gender violence – assaults, rapes, and murder

3.

Coups/conflicts/war, eg. Bougainville, Fiji “coup culture”, Solomon

Islands

4.

But the biggest one of all is West Papua

5.

Freedom of speech, expression

6.

So-called “Climate refugees” – a very real situation, and international

law is lagging behind



or deliberative journalism. And I’ll talk about strategies for addressing these issues, such as “mindful”or deliberative journalism. 1. ASYLUM SEEKERS



Asia director for Human Rights Watch, recently summed this up rather well in

of the Pacific”, has been too often part of the problem these days.

Asylum seekers, the first human rights concern for the Pacific. Phil Robertson,Asia director for Human Rights Watch, recently summed this up rather well in The Guardian , when he argued that Australia, which fancies itself as the “policemanof the Pacific”, has been too often part of the problem these days.



Politicians trapped in the refugee policy dialogue in Canberra frequently fail

to recognise that Australia’s boat push-back policies, and offshoring asylum

seekers into abusive conditions of detention in Nauru and on Manus Island, are

seen as a green-light by Asian governments to do the same: send asylum seekers

and refugees back into harm’s way or lock them up in indefinite detention.

For example, during the south-east Asia boat people crisis in May 2015,

the Thai, Malaysian and Indonesian navies played a cruel game of “human

ping-pong” by pushing away boats of

starving and sick Rohingya.

In contrast to the impression that most mainstream media

conveys, Australia has the least influx problem and yet the most inhumane way

of dealing with it.

With the recent High Court ruling,

Australia now faces the return of 267 asylum seekers to Nauru and Manus Island,

where they face possible renewed physical and sexual assault, and life in

limbo.

Australia’s international reputation has suffered enough

– it’s time to do the right thing by accepting its responsibilities, not only

as a party to the UN Refugee Convention but also as a responsible neighbour and

member of the international community, and provide this group with fair and

timely refugee status determination in Australia.

2. GENDER VIOLENCE

rights lens. Violence against women and girls, and children generally, is a

critical human rights problem across the Pacific. The rape, brutal beating and

burning alive of women accused of sorcery is agonising in its brutality.

4. WEST PAPUA

Before the West Papuan conflict emerged at the front of

Pacific consciousness, the 24-year illegal occupation of Timor-Leste, or East

Timor, was a cause célèbre ignored by the region’s media – at least until the

massacre of 270 people at the Santa Cruz cemetery in 1991.



East Timor is the scene of the worst human rights

violations against journalists in the Pacific, the

Australian-based journalists (including 2 Britons and a New Zealander) were

murdered in cold blood on 16 October 1975. They were trying to “bear witness”

to the impending Indonesian invasion.

rights atrocities.

5. FREEDOM OF SPEECH



everybody worldwide. All people have the right to hold their own opinions, and

the right to seek, receive and share information and ideas. For journalists,

this right is essential to seeking out the truth. Without this freedom, we

cannot interview citizens or seek information from public officials. Freedom of speech is a fundamental human right foreverybody worldwide. All people have the right to hold their own opinions, andthe right to seek, receive and share information and ideas. For journalists,this right is essential to seeking out the truth. Without this freedom, wecannot interview citizens or seek information from public officials.

The right to freedom of speech is very broad – it covers

many freedoms essential to work as journalists, such as:

• Freedom of issuing and distributing newspapers

• Independence of broadcast licensing and regulation

• Prohibition of all censorship

• Freedom of accessing and distributing information

ARTICLE 19 OF THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS

But it ought to be remembered that this universal

declaration is for everybody not just a privileged status for media

organisations or journalists. Freedoms do not exist in isolation:

All rights are interrelated, interdependent and

indivisible:

1. Freedom of expression linked to right of peaceful

assembly and association (A20)

2. Also linked to the freedom of thought, conscience and

religion (A18)

3. State treaties – dualist v. monetist systems

4. Regional treaties

all societies, and we are challenged to accommodate free expression and its

close relative press freedom within new technological and cultural contexts.

Journalism professor Mark Pearson, of Griffith University, and a until recently

a Reporters Without Borders researcher,

applied to the reporting of the South Pacific in his inaugural UNESCO World

Press Freedom speech at Auckland in 2013. Press systems and ethical frameworks are on the agenda inall societies, and we are challenged to accommodate free expression and itsclose relative press freedom within new technological and cultural contexts.Journalism professor Mark Pearson, of Griffith University, and a until recentlya Reporters Without Borders researcher, spoke on “peace journalism” models asapplied to the reporting of the South Pacific in his inaugural UNESCO WorldPress Freedom speech at Auckland in 2013. He used this to introduce another

recent trend in journalism theory to apply basic “principles of mindfulness and

compassion” to a media context, a process which he dubbed “mindful journalism”.

Since then he has contributed as co-editor to a book called Mindful Journalism and News Ethics in the Digital Era: A Buddhist approach. In a simple

explanation, he describes first what “Mindful journalism” is not:

• An attempt to convert you into “Buddhism”|

• An attempt to impose yet another code of practice on

journalists

• A bid for the new approach to theory and ethics. (It is

complementary to deliberative/public/peace/civic/citizen/inclusive journalisms).



He then outlines what Mindful Journalism is:

• A lens (or even theory) offering a set of tools for the

analysis of journalism

• A moral framework to underpin ethical decision-making

in journalism

• A possible tool of resilience for journalists (work in

progress)

In contrast to human rights journalism, mainstream/legacy

media “generally sides with official rhetoric and policy”

• Human rights news is usually reported as individual

actions

• No reporting of “the system”

• “Predominant war journalism” of West dominates global

news flow

media under scrutiny. While the media is watching other sectors in a community,

who is watching the media? Especially on human rights issues.

6. ‘CLIMATE REFUGEES’

Images of “nuclear refugees at Bikini Atoll, Marshall

Islands, conjures up images of “climate refugees”…. The 2015 case of

38-year-old i-Kiribati man Ioane Teitoata, who lost his appeal case against New

Zealand Immigration to have him and his family defined as “climate refugees”.

But the case exposed how flawed the law and New Zealand’s policies were around

climate change.

In 1946, the Bikini Atoll islanders were the first

nuclear refugees in Pacific – “relocated” for the US nuclear tests. In 1985,

Rongelap islanders were evacuation by the Rainbow Warrior and then in 2011 we

had the Fukushima nuclear refugees after the Tohuku tsunami.

“Climate refugees” currently have no legal definition or

status. However, there needs to be:

A climate refugee is a person displaced by climatically

induced environmental disasters. Such disasters result from incremental and rapid ecological change,

resulting in increased droughts, desertification, sea level rise, and the more

frequent occurrence of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, cyclones,

fires, mass flooding and tornadoes. All this is causing mass global migration

and border conflicts.

In 2000, 2700 Carteret Islanders left their atoll

homeland in Papua New Guinea and became an iconic and tragic symbol. In 2013,

came the Pacific Islands Forum Majuro Declaration for “climate leadership”, yet

two years later a i-Kiribati man, Ioane Teitiota, failed in legal bid for

“climate refugee” status.



altogether) involved in a journalism and television “bearing witness” project

to prepare oral histories and current affairs items on a Students

working on this project were thrilled by the experience and won a group award

for innovative journalism. Last year, we had some 40 students (and about 60 peoplealtogether) involved in a journalism and television “bearing witness” projectto prepare oral histories and current affairs items on a Rainbow Warriormicrosite as a public resource.Studentsworking on this project were thrilled by the experience and won a group awardfor innovative journalism.

Finally, to wrap up, the problems of war or mainstream

journalism are largely blamed for under reporting and/or misrepresentation of

political and structural forms of violence – the greater human rights

violations. Human Rights Journalism and “bearing witness’ complement the four major orientations of

the peace journalism model:

Solution rather than victory

Truth rather than propaganda

People rather than elite

Win-win rather than win-lose

Also human rights oriented journalism needs to have a

global (and local) perspective instead of selective reporting and ignoring

major issues (such as West Papua), any “bias” ought to be in favour of

vulnerable voices, be proactive and attachment to victims and survivors,

instead of the political elites.
