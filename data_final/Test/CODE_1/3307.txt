KOTA KINABALU: Five Malay­sian hostages are on the run with their Abu Sayyaf captors in the mountainous jungles of Jolo amid an intensely sustained Philippines military offensive against the militants.

Jolo anti-kidnapping activist Prof Octavio Dinampo said the five Malaysians, who were among 13 Abu Sayyaf captives, were constantly on the move in the jungles of the southern Philippines island.

The gunmen are facing problems holding on to their captives.

They are forced to move around at night and by first daylight, the military is already tracking them down, he said.

It is a tough situation for the captives because they are always on the move and food is scarce.

It would be hard to say whether all the hostages could survive such an ordeal, Octavio said.

He said the Abu Sayyaf were known to be constantly moving around the jungles of Patikul, Indanan and Parang.

He believed the five Malaysians – Tayuddin Anjut, 45, Mohd Ridzuan Ismail, 32, Fandy Bakran, 26, Mohd Zumadil Rahim, 23, and Abd Rahim Summas – ­were being held by sub-commander Majan Sahidjuan or more commonly known as Apo Mike.

They were kidnapped from a tugboat near Dent Haven in Lahad Datu on July 18.

Three of the seven Indonesian captives were being held by gunmen under the command of Indang Susukan, who was reportedly injured during a firefight with Philippine soldiers late last month.

Also in the hands of the gunmen known as the Sawadjan brothers were four Indonesians and a Norwegian.

Three of the Indonesians – Lorence Kotten, 34, Teo Dorus Kopong, 42, and Emanuel –­­ were abducted from a Malaysian fishing boat off Sinakut in Lahad Datu on July 9.

Another Indonesian fishing boat skipper Harman Mangga, 30, who was reportedly abducted on Aug 3 off Kinabatangan waters has not been seen among the Abu Sayyaf kidnap victims.

It is believed that he had been freed after a private deal between the abductors and the Sandakan-based owners of the fishing vessel.

Octavio said the Philippines military had dispatched 9,000 soldiers to Jolo in the offensive against the militants that was expected to last until at least December.

Jolo is flooded with soldiers at the moment, he said, adding that military operations were focused on five municipalities – Indanan, Pa­­rang, Patikul, Maimbung and Talipao.

The military offensive came amid Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s warning to the Abu Sayyaf that he would eat them alive as they were beyond redemption.
