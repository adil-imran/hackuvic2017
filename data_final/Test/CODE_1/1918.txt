Russians accused of violating airspace

Turkey warned of consequences Saturday after saying a Russian SU-34 jet had violated its airspace, despite alerts. Russia denied that there had been any incursion.

Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, a Russian Defense Ministry spokesman, said that Turkish radar installations were not capable of identifying a particular aircraft or its type or nationality and that no verbal warning had been issued.

Turkey’s Foreign Ministry said in its statement that the Russian ambassador had been summoned late Friday and that the violation was a clear sign that Russia wanted issues between the two countries to escalate. “We are making a clear call to the Russian Federation not to violate Turkish airspace, which is also NATO airspace,” the statement said.

In November, Turkey shot down a Russian warplane flying a sortie over Syria that it said had violated its airspace, triggering a diplomatic rupture in which Russia imposed economic sanctions.
