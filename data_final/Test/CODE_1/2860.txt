Election Day may not be until Tuesday, but more than 1 million Ohioans have already cast ballots and both the Democratic and Republican parties are pushing hard to lock in more early voters before the big day.

“In terms of ground game, that’s what this last week is about,” said Xavier University political science professor Mack Mariani.

More than 1.05 million voters have cast ballots in Ohio, according to Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted.

Nationwide about 23 million early votes have been cast, according to NBC News.

The NBC analysis of battleground state absentee voting found that Democratic-affiliated voters had cast more ballots than Republican-affiliated voters in Ohio, Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Virginia and Wisconsin.

Republican-affiliated voters have cast more ballots than Democrats in Arizona, Florida, Georgia and Pennsylvania, NBC found.

Husted did not break out voters statewide by party affiliation, a calculation that can only be determined in Ohio based on an analysis of which party’s ballot the voter requested in the March primary. Many voters do not request a partisan ballot.

Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said voters are turning out in high numbers and there was a major surge on Sunday with the churches’ “Souls to the Polls” effort to get people to go vote after services.

“We’re encouraged by what we’re seeing so far, but we’re not letting up off the gas,” Pepper said. “Enthusiasm is high, and we have thousands of volunteers across the state, helping to turn out Democratic voters from now through Election Day.”

Brittany Warner, spokeswoman for the Ohio Republican Party, said Chairman Matt “Borges has made early voting a priority for the Ohio Republican Party this election and the data we’re seeing so far shows that our efforts are paying off. Republicans tend to be more Election Day voters, but we have worked to close the gap in 2016.”

As of Friday nearly 1.6 million Ohioans had requested ballots and the more 1.05 million who had cast them was down compared to this time in 2012. That year nearly 2 million people had requested absentee ballots and more than 1.2 million had been cast at this point, according to Husted’s office.

But those numbers were tallied before the first weekend of early voting hours, which began Saturday and brought people out in droves, according to area boards of election.

In Montgomery County 2,700 people voted on Saturday and Sunday, and board Deputy Director Steve Harsman expects that from next Friday to Monday 10,000 people will show up to vote in person.

“Our biggest weekend is always the last weekend,” Harsman said.

He said the board’s newly renovated and expanded early voting area has proven to be up to the challenge.

“There has been no more than a 10 minute wait,” Harsman said. “We encourage people to come out and vote in person.”

Other boards are in smaller counties but still had large weekend turnouts for their size.

“Sunday was busy. We had a line of 50 people at 1 p.m.,” said Jason Baker, director of the Clark County Board of Elections. “In the last two days we’ve seen a 150 percent increase in voters.”

He said 792 people voted on Saturday and Sunday and through the week there is a constant line of about 20 or 30 people waiting to vote.

He said early voters like to “avoid the hassle of waiting in lines on Election Day or want to get it done and get it over with.”

In Greene County the busiest time for voting is the afternoon, said Llyn McCoy, board director.

“People are bringing camp chairs,” she said.

Brian Sleeth, director of the Warren County Board of Elections, said the board is “extremely busy” and he had 80 people in line to vote on Sunday when the board opened.

Butler County Board of Elections Deputy Director Jocelyn Bucaro said early in-person voting is up 28 percent over 2012 and requests for absentee ballots are higher, although the rate of return is lagging 2012 numbers.

“People are giving us great reviews about voting early,” she said.

Sleeth said the post office is keeping up well with ballots and he’s even got a call from the postmaster in Washington D.C. to see how things were going.

The other area board officials also said they are having few problems getting ballots to and from voters in a timely fashion. All ballots include a card telling the voter how much postage is required, an amount that can vary from a single Forever stamp to more, depending on the weight of the ballot. In Montgomery County all ballots cost 68 cents to mail.

Absentee ballots can be requested until noon Saturday. Ballots must be postmarked by Monday to be counted. They can be hand delivered by voters to the local board office until the polls close at 7:30 p.m. on Election Day. With Election Day not far off elections officials recommend that voters to take their ballots to be postmarked at the post office.

Properly postmarked ballots will be counted as long as they arrive at the board by Nov. 18, said Matt McClelland, spokesman for Husted.

In person voting continues through 2 p.m. on Monday.

Absentee ballots can be track at MyOhioVote.com.

Voters are urged to call their local board if they have any questions or problems.
