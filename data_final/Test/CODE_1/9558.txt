PanARMENIAN.Net - The book “Grandchildren of the Priest: Dersim Armenians” by Kazim Gundogan has been published in Turkey, Tert.am reports citing Bolsohays.com.

The author unveils a collection of stories of Christian Armenians who lost their properties, culture, religion and language during the Genocide of 1915 and the massacres of 1895.

Some of Dersim Armenians managed to survive but lost everything in the aftermath.

Following the Genocide of 1915, the Armenians’ only place of worship – Surb Karapet monastery of Halvor – was bombarded.

The author has met and talked with the survivors who recalled their lives before the slaughter, the road of exile, forced Turkification and Islamization.
