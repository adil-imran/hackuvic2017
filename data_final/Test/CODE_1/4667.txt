Kurdish 'Angelina Jolie'

BBC World News ^ | Sept. 12 , 2106 | BBC

Posted on by LeoWindhorse

She was, according to Western media, a poster-girl for her people, admired as much for her striking good looks as her military prowess. The 19-year-old, from the Syrian Kurdish city of Qamishli, was killed by Islamic State (IS) militants in northern Syria last month.

By all means she was far better looking than Angie! Sad to lose such a brave woman. But thankful that such women exist.

“This thread is useless without PICs” written by someone who obviously is biased towards syrian women. Nothing to see here.

"Look at their pictures, they are all angels, all beautiful, you can't pick one just because she looks like a Hollywood actress, Angelina Jolie or Julia Roberts.

"They have nothing in common with them. They prefer to die rather than live under one of the most anti-women groups in the world." It's not often one finds courage in the most desolate places on earth. God Bless them, every one.

A hero by any standard.

“They have nothing in common with them. They prefer to die rather than live under one of the most anti-women groups in the world.” These gals get their butts in the sand and fight and die for what they believe in. The Hollywierd crowd attends fundraisers and make “political statements” in movies written by other people. NO COMPARISON!

This thread is useless without PICs............ Obviously they didn’t read the article. There are several pictures there. At least she was wearing clothes.



To: PapaBear3625

She looked a lot more like Penelope Cruz than Angelina Jolie to my eye. But our POS commander in chief’s lack of backbone to take on the JV meant that the job was left to heroes like this.



To: PapaBear3625

Get Some!

"Sad to lose such a brave woman. But thankful that such women exist." Bah! We have much better in America. We have brave, strong, mighty football players who take a knee, link arms, or pump a powerful and angry fist into the air to protest - uh - something or other.

"The entire philosophy of YPJ is to fight sexism and prevent using women as a sexual object," he said. "We want to give women their rightful place in society and for them to own their own destinies. Viyan died for these ideals. In the media, no-one talked about the ideals for which she gave her life, nor what Viyan achieved for women in Rojava in the past four years." Kudos and rest in peace whether she was beautiful or looked like Janet Reno. She was braver than some men.

“At least she was wearing clothes.” Yeah, no telling where that’s been. I had a bad experience hunting as a kid, and I always avoid heavy bush.

Yes, Penelope Cruz. She doesn’t look like Angelina. RIP.

Brave and noble woman, and attractive too. It shows that a woman can be strong, patriotic, and still be a woman. She had more courage than most men, including that troll from Return of Kings.

What a damn shame. She’s a true heroine.



To: nevergore

She could have been a 450 pound moose of a woman. That would not have lessened my respect for her one bit! PS Yes, in all fairness, she is very attractive.



To: piytar

Looks a little like the character “Ziva” on NCIS ...



To: LeoWindhorse

No whey.
