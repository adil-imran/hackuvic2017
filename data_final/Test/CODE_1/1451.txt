Mumbai, Aug. 17 (ANI): Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his Independence Day address, the Samajwadi Party (SP) on Wednesday said the former had indulged in self-praise instead of solving the Kashmir unrest issue.

Speaking to ANI, Samajwadi Party leader Abu Azmi said the Centre should sit and talk with the people of Kashmir, social organisations and the members of the Hurriyat.

"Pakistan's interference is increasing due to the Kashmir issue. It is a serious matter and threat for the nation. Instead of solving the problem, the Prime Minister indulges in self-praise for one-and-a-half-hour," he added.

Azmi said it should be the first priority of all the political parties to bring peace in the Valley.

"If the Prime Minister indulges in self-praise, then how will the problems of the nation end? It is the responsibility of all the political parties to bring peace to the Valley. It should be our first priority," he added.

Prime Minister Modi's address on Independence Day asserted that he has completely rerouted his policy on Pakistan with aggressive comments referring to islamabad's human rights abuses in its large province of Balochistan as well as Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir.

He said the people of Balochistan have thanked him for drawing attention to their troubles, a reference to his warning last week that if Pakistan continues instigating the violence that has seared the Kashmir Valley for over a month, India will be compelled to expose Islamabad's many wrongdoings in regions fighting terror and atrocities by its security forces.

The Prime Minister's comments about Pakistan were placed at the end of a lengthy speech he delivered in the traditional address on August 15 from the ramparts of the Red Fort.

Prime Minister Modi also highlighted a number of schemes launched by his government.

He mentioned how the speed of delivery in vital areas of governance had increased. In this context, he gave examples such as rural roads construction, renewable energy generation capacity, laying of transmission lines, and cooking gas connections.

The Prime Minister spoke of the scale on which work had been accomplished in certain areas, such as opening of 21 crore bank accounts under the Jan Dhan Yojana, construction of two crore toilets in rural areas, and electrification of 10,000 unelectrified villages in a short span of time.

He also talked about a number of integrated approach towards welfare of women, which includes elements such as Beti-Bachao, Beti Padhao, Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana, and Ujjwala Yojana, to ensure the physical, educational and financial well-being of women. He mentioned several other government initiatives in this regard. (ANI)
