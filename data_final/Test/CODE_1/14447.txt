Once called Paradise on Earth but now it is dotted with sandbags and military check posts. Armed resistance to Indian rule broke out in the Kashmir Valley in 1989 calling for independence. The emphasis of the movement soon shifted from nationalism to Islam. Caught in the middle, the minority community of Kashmiri Hindus - the Kashmiri Pandits, who had lived in Kashmir for centuries - had to leave their homeland. Controversy surrounds the mass exodus of Kashmiri Pandits. While the separatists call it an engineered conspiracy by Jagmohan, then-governor of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, in order to defame the separatist movement, the other side labels it as ‘ethnic cleansing’.

The story of Kashmiri Pandits is an extraordinarily difficult one to tell. On the one hand, when the insurgency erupted in Indian-administered Kashmir in 1989, thousands of Pandits left the valley, suggesting that the community suffered enough intimidation to abandon their homes. On the other hand, the accounts of Kashmiri Pandits who stayed behind in Kashmir contradict claims by Pandits in the diaspora who say that Kashmiri Pandits suffered ‘a genocide’ and were forced 'into exile'. Indeed, understanding the experience of the Pandits, caught between Kashmir's Muslim majority and the ambitions of the Indian state, is an intricate affair. Even the semantics describing the flight of the Pandits from Kashmir are highly politicized and contentious. In order to get the fair picture of the unfortunate exodus, one needs to analyze different dimensions of the story:

Migration?

Putting the flight of Pandits into perspective: Was it a 'migration' or an 'exodus'? Given the large numbers involved and the relatively short time frame in which most of the departures of the Kashmiri Pandits happened, the more accurate term would have to be an "exodus". Why is language so important here? And why do we conclude that the language used by Pandits, like 'expulsion' and 'exile' as an indictment of the Indian state? The language used to describe the departures is important because it involves the question of making claims on the state. The term 'migration' suggests voluntariness to their departure, which most Kashmiri Pandits would rightly deny. Many Kashmiri Pandits prefer the term exile or expulsion as being a more accurate description of their situation and descriptions of themselves as 'refugees' and 'refugees in their own country'. How do we understand this flight then? People who remained behind say that others felt intimidated and left, but there are also suggestions that those who left might have been encouraged to do so. This is an issue that is mired in a great deal of controversy. It still awaits a careful sifting of evidence. However, I think it is safe to say that there were probably elements of both circumstances at work in explaining the departure of the Pandits from the valley. A large number of Pandits have testified to the fact that there were threats issued to them both individually and indirectly to the community. An important element of the background is also the killing of a number of senior Pandit officials in various organizations. The militants claimed that they were only targeting Indian agents but, from the Pandit perspective, the fact that the targets were exclusively Hindu was an indication that the threat was a communal one. At the same time, several separatist leaders have claimed that it was the Indian state, working through its governor in Jammu and Kashmir at the time, Jagmohan, that engineered the departures of the Hindus so as to leave the government a free hand to deal with Muslim militants. In any case, the idea that encouragement was the sole trigger that incited the departure of such large numbers is hard to believe. If this had been the case, it would have required the mobilization of state resources on such a large scale that it would have left behind concrete evidence, not just traces in the form of rumors. However, there are many Kashmiri Muslims who have witnessed departing Pandits boarding vehicles organized by the state. Wajahat Habibullah, who was a senior Indian administrator in the state, allows that there may have been some instances of transport being organized for a few groups of Pandits but he denies that this was part of a widespread concerted policy. He adds, however, another element to the various explanations on offer for the Pandit migrations. He recalls groups of Muslims appealing to him to stop the Pandits from leaving, which led him to suggest to Governor Jagmohan that a television broadcast be made advertising the request of hundreds of Muslims to their Pandit compatriots not to leave the valley. According to Habibullah, Jagmohan did not agree to this suggestion. Instead he made several announcements that reassured Pandits that if they did decide to leave, refugee settlement camps had been set up for them and also that departing civil servants among the Pandits would continue to be paid their salaries. The political scientist, Sumit Ganguly, adds another important factor – that Jagmohan had also announced that his government would not be able to guarantee their safety, if Pandits decided to remain in the valley. Although not an indication of a coordinated government policy to engineer the departure of the Pandits, these were signs certainly of a government not making great efforts to prevent the Pandit exodus. The reality is probably a combination of all these elements. What can be said with as much certainty as it is possible to have in these circumstances is that Kashmiri Pandits must have felt a threat to their safety – whether an immediate threat or a sense that their future, that of their families and their property was no longer secure in the valley. This sense must have varied from family to family and individual to individual. If they had not felt endangered in this way, it would be extremely difficult to explain how such large numbers would give up and leave the place that had been their homeland for centuries.

Confusing numbers?

And yet there are no precise numbers regarding the migration/exodus of Pandits. Figures from within and figures from the outside are so different. Some say 700,000 left, others say 100,000 left. Why is there such ambiguity over the numbers? One of the chief causes of the ambiguity is because the numbers of Pandits in the valley in 1989 can only be adduced from the census of 1941, the last time the Pandits were counted and listed as distinct from the category of Kashmiri Hindus and that census listed a little fewer than 79,000 Pandits in the valley. It's from this baseline that demographers have sought to work out the number of Kashmir Pandits in the valley in 1990. Using the rough measure of the average decennial growth rate in the state as a whole, available through the censuses up to 1941 and then the 2001 census, the number of Kashmiri Pandits living in the valley before 1990 that they arrive at is about 160,000 to 170,000. So the number of 700,000 as representing the number of Kashmiri Pandit departures after 1989-1990 is not credible because that exceeds by many hundreds of thousands the total of the Kashmiri Pandit population at the time. Another potentially misleading aspect of the counting of Pandit departures is that the total put forward often also includes those Pandits who had left the state voluntarily between 1947 and 1990. According to the political scientist, Alexander Evans, 95 per cent of the Kashmiri Pandits living in the valley left in 1990, i.e. anything between 150,000 and 160,000. However, a 2010 report of the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre of the Norwegian Refugee Council suggests that 250,000 Pandits have been displaced since 1990. And a CIA report suggests a figure of 300,000 displaced from the whole state.

Genocide or not?

The state says that no more than 219 Pandits were killed and the KPSS says the figure will probably touch on 650 (between 1990 and 2010). Are these figures important to flesh out or do they merely detract from the issue? The question of whether the killing of Kashmiri Pandits after 1990 constitutes genocide is as difficult to answer as it has been difficult to define genocide. There is still a great deal of disagreement on this among international legal experts and scholars. However, there is agreement at least that the number has to be a substantial proportion of the total population of the group. And here the numbers of Kashmiri Pandit killings do not technically support the use of the label of genocide. There are several other factors, beyond the question of numbers, according to which the Pandits cannot be considered to be the victims of genocide. For one, they were not the sole victims of targeted killings in Kashmir since 1990. More number of Kashmiri Muslims felt prey and have also been systematically liquidated in the way in which Pandits had been. This does not conform to the accepted definition of genocide that is waged against a group defined collectively as the 'other', since Pandit claims of genocide rests on their being targeted for their religious identity. Secondly, genocide is preceded and accompanied by the dehumanization of its victims. There is no evidence of such denial of humanity of the Pandits having taken place among the Kashmiri Muslims accused of perpetrating their mass destruction. And finally genocides are extremely well-organized acts involving the training of armed groups, indoctrinated fully into an ideological inflexibility so severe that it can override wider social opinion and consensus. There is no evidence of this having been the case in the valley. But the definition of genocide has serious implications for Kashmiri Muslims, too. Among these is the unstated but still real assumption that Kashmiri Muslims, accused of such a heinous crime, can expect no sympathy for their demands for self-determination or independence. Furthermore, portraying Kashmiri Muslims as genocidal killers also puts them beyond the pale of the law and serves indirectly to justify the use of draconian laws against ordinary civilians as well as the heavy militarization of the valley with the army acting with unchecked impunity against them.

Muslim silence?

It has been suggested that Kashmiri Muslims were complicit through their silence when Pandits were intimidated. Is this accurate or unfair? Once again, the complicity - active or passively through silence in the face of the threats issued by certain groups - of Kashmiri Muslims is an allegation that is enmeshed in controversy. There are Muslims themselves who have expressed guilt for not having intervened more decisively to prevent the departures of their Pandit neighbors and friends. But this guilt is mostly retrospectively expressed; even if some people are inclined to take this self-implication as evidence of complicity, it must be remembered that in the early months of 1990, when the largest numbers of Pandit departures took place, the situation was a highly unstable and confusing one for all those living in the valley, including the Muslims. Muslims were also the subjects of intimidation at the hands of extremist groups and many of them the victims of extortion and retributive violence if they refused to comply with. As was also true in the context of the partition of 1947, neither Muslims nor Hindus were certain of their own futures, so it is hard to imagine that most Muslims could have been in a position to guarantee with any confidence the safety of their Pandit neighbors. However, despite this, as Habibullah’s account mentioned earlier has it; there were still large numbers of Muslims who did try actively to dissuade the Pandits from leaving. There is another reason why it is hard to believe that the valley's Muslims, as a whole, would have wanted the Pandits to leave and that is the fear prevalent among large numbers of them – spread through widely circulated rumors - that the evacuation of the Pandits was preliminary to a government plan to then hit at all Muslims to stem militancy without the risk of collateral damage to the Hindus. So it is hard to imagine that they would have wanted to force the departure of the Hindus.

Kashmiri Pandits who never fled Kashmir

In one of the interviews, Sanjay Tickoo, KPSS head, remembers the day he found a poster instructing his family to leave the valley or die pasted to the wall of his home. Sanjay Tickoo remembers it well. It was a warm summer's day in 1990, when he found a poster pasted to the outside wall of his home in Srinagar, the capital of Indian-administered Kashmir. It was written in Urdu, which Sanjay could not read, so he took it to his grandfather and asked him to translate it."As he read it out to us, tears rolled down his cheeks ... it basically instructed our family to leave the valley or die," Tickoo says. But Tickoo's family refused to leave. Instead, Tickoo, who was in his early twenties at the time, decided to take the threat to the local newspaper, where he paid for it to be placed as an advertisement in the classifieds section. "It was published on the back page. I wish I still had a copy, but they published it as is," he recalls. No sooner had it been published, shocked Muslim neighbours and friends congregated at Tickoo's home, apologizing for the misdeed and promising that his family faced no threat. They urged him not to leave. On the one hand, he says, the community did experience intimidation and violence. But, on the other, he says, there was no genocide or mass murder as suggested by Pandit communities based outside Kashmir. But collating the numbers, or even unravelling the language of migration and exodus, is part of the historical ambiguity that surrounds the Pandits' flight from the valley. And it has been made all the harder by the fact that Pandits outside Kashmir have dominated the narrative, while those inside have remained largely silent. While Tickoo dismisses claims that Pandits were 'ethnically cleansed', he says that relations between the two communities did sour when the insurgency began. He says people left because they felt threatened. "I am not saying that [Kashmiri Pandits and Muslims] were brothers in arms, living in each other's homes or something before 1989. Yes, there was an unmistakable tolerance and respect for each other ... violence was unheard of ... but it would be a lie to say something did not change when the trouble started.” From hateful slogans that blared from the loudspeakers of mosques to comments whispered on the streets, Tickoo says there was a sudden change in attitude towards Hindus. And these shifting sentiments were used by politicians on both sides, helping to stoke fear among the Hindu minority. "Until today, we don't know who posted that threat on my wall," Tickoo says.

“We suffered intimidation from both sides.” It is a sentiment SumanVikash Bhat, a 33-year-old assistant professor of Microbiology at Islamic University of Science and Technology shares in one of the interviews. He says that during the 1990s, when militancy was at its peak, it was common for the army to take out their frustrations, when soldiers were killed, on the civilian population, irrespective of religion. As a community, Kashmiri Pandits were not spared the indiscriminate crackdowns and violence meted out to Kashmiri Muslims. "They would often respond by beating civilians and there was a lot of these crackdowns where people would be gathered ... for sure they would give us ordinary people a thrashing", Suman Bhat says. "They used to sometimes pick people up ... both sides did so ... but there were also good and bad people on both sides." Suman Bhat says he remembers the late 1980s and early 1990s vividly - the curfews, the crackdowns and, crucially, his Hindu relatives leaving. "It was easy to feel insecure," he reminisces, "the newspapers at the time were full of stories of violence and as we watched the militancy or terrorism or whatever you want to call it increasing, with the fact that people were being killed, it was only natural that the community became insecure." But he says that his family's relations with Kashmiri Muslims made them feel confident that they were not under threat.

Other Minorities

A whole generation of young Kashmiris has grown up since the 25 years of militancy not knowing their Kashmiri Pandit compatriots as significant members of their society. That has certainly affected their understanding of what it means to be Kashmiri. However, contrary to impressions created by the more rabidly anti-Muslim constituencies in mainland India, this has not turned these young Kashmiris into Muslim fanatics intolerant of religious others. It has to be remembered that besides the small number of Pandits who have remained in the valley, there is also a significant segment of a Sikh population that has lived in Kashmir largely unscathed. It is only on March 20, 2000 that, for the first time, the 40,000 strong Sikh constituency of the valley was targeted when 35 Sikh villagers were massacred at Chattisinghpora, a village near Anantnag in southern Kashmir. However, even in this instance there is strong evidence to suggest that these killings were engineered just to make a political point - that all was not well in Kashmir - at a time that coincided with the visit of the US president, Bill Clinton, to India. Still, despite such coldly manipulative efforts by agencies to pit socio-religious groups against each other, and beyond the Chattisinghpora killings, the Sikhs have not felt themselves to be in any particular danger in the valley. In a few instances when certain groups have issued threats to the community in more recent years, Kashmiri Muslims have been vocal in condemning such aggressive language. Also, in terms of the dramatic transformation of Kashmiri society since 1990 what cannot be denied is something that many Kashmiri Muslim elders themselves say in that they feel the education of their young has been impaired by being deprived of a cosmopolitanism that Kashmiri Pandit teachers and students leant to their schools. If the exodus of the Pandits has altered Kashmiri society in radical ways on the one hand, equally dramatic has been the loss of a whole generation of mostly Muslim youth to violence at the hands both of both the ends. Besides the thousands of dead, there are thousands of the 'disappeared' that have created a yawning gap in Kashmiri society.

Now after 26 years of that unfortunate exodus, I think we need to move away from the biased tunnel-vision perspective in which Kashmiri Brahmins are the only rightful inhabitants of the State and all the rest are marauding usurpers who have, over the span of 10 centuries, through conversions, reduced Brahmins to a helpless minority and finally kicked them out of the State.

I’ve come across many Kashmiri Pandit brethren, both moderates & extremists, throughout India who either directly or indirectly blamed me, Kashmir’s majority community, for their exodus. I conveyed them all one way or the other that we were also the victims and continue to be the same. One of my memories from a few from my childhood I still have with me is that I learnt ‘Numbers’ from Dolly Mam, a Kashmiri Pandit. If the feelings of a common Kashmiri are to be believed then we all treat Kashmiri Pandits as our brothers as we share a common bond of Kashmiryat unlike other Indian States and that’s the reason, whatever happened in 90’s, we don’t have a single incident of communal riot in the history of Kashmir. Finally, irrespective of everything , as I’ve conveyed them all & today I reiterate on the 26th anniversary of that unfortunate exodus that you are all strongly welcome to your homeland.
