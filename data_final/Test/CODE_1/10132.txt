SENATOR Francis Escudero expressed hope on Saturday that the bill seeking to modernize the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) would be enacted into law, in order to strengthen government efforts in stopping deadly attack on media practitioners and activists in the country.

Senate Bill 2950, authored by Escudero, defines and categorized the priority cases that should principally be referred to the NBI, which include extrajudicial killings committed by the State's security forces against media practitioners and activists in the country.

The measure was approved on third and final reading by the Senate on January 25.

Escudero said the bill would help the NBI solve extrajudicial killings faster.

"I am of the belief that the best deterrent to crime is still the speedy resolution of cases. With a modernized NBI, I am confident that we will be better equipped in fighting and solving crimes," the senator said.

A former chair of Senate justice and human rights committee, Escudero noted that the country has been severely criticized even in the international community because of numerous unsolved cases of violence against journalists, activists and judges in the country.

Escudero cited the World Report 2016 by New York-based Human Rights Watch, which included killings of activists and media workers in the Philippines.

In a 659-page report, the Human Rights Watch said there were at least 13 tribal leaders and tribal community members allegedly killed by assailants often linked to the military or paramilitary groups in the first eight months of 2015.

With eight media practitioners killed in the first 10 months of last year, the report labeled 2015 as another “deadly year” for Filipino journalists, and noted that the resolution to media killings in the country was lacking.

“We should not tolerate this culture of impunity in our country because it does not only concern the violation of human rights but it also hurts the country’s image among potential investors abroad,” he said.

The senator said the proposed measure would strengthen the NBI as an institution to make it more responsive to the demands of the times.

In 2013, Escudero said the Philippines was named as the third most dangerous country in the world for journalists, just behind the strife-torn Syria and Iraq, according to the report by the London-based International News Safety Institute.

As of June 2014, a total of 145 media workers in the country have been killed in the line of duty since 1986, including at least 33 in the 2009 Ampatuan massacre, based on the data by Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility.

"With modern equipment, skilled agents and defined responsibilities, I am confident that the NBI will be in better position to help our security forces in combating crimes and resolving incidents of extrajudicial killings in the country," Escudero said. (Sunnex)
