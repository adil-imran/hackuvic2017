US citizens will go to the polls in less than two weeks to decide if they want Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump to be their next President.

With the debates out of the way, the race is into its final stages - with both candidates racking up some serious air miles to give speeches across the country.

A week ago, Hillary Clinton was riding a seemingly unassailable lead in the national polls.

But her lead has shrunk dramatically - it could even be within the margin of error.

Between now and the election we'll bring you the latest poll results, along with the rolling average calculated by TalkingPointsMemo.com

Here's the state of the polls in the US presidential election as they stand.

Who is winning the US Presidential election?

November 3 - Florida and Georgia

With five days to go until polling day, let’s take a look at some polls in a couple of the crucial swing states.

Polls close in Florida before most of the country, and with 29 electoral votes on the table and the polls on a knife edge it’s a pretty big deal for both candidates.

TPM have Clinton ahead by 1.4 points on average, but in recent days we’ve seen a string of new polls from Fox, CNN and Trafalgar placing her between 1 and 4 points ahead.

Her lead gets significantly wider in polls which include third party candidate Gary Johnson.

Georgia has 16 votes up for grabs, and Trump is just holding on to a one point lead in the most recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll.

Turning to the national averages, Donald’s taken a dip which has opened the race up a bit in TPM’s averages. There’s 2.9 points between them as we go into the final five days.

FiveThirtyEight’s forecast, on the other hand, has Trump gaining some significant ground. They’re now giving him a 33% probability of winning the election.

Donald Trump has taken the lead the ABC/Washington Post poll for the first time.

He’s used his slender 1 point majority in the four way poll - which also includes third party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein - to claim momentum for his campaign…and make a play for an unusual demographic. People who have already voted.

Many states allow “early voting” - where polling stations open on a series of days ahead of polling day in an attempt to increase turnout.

But in some states - including Wisconsin, where Trump was speaking last night - voters can change their minds up to three times in the run up to polling day.

Trump urged Democrats in the state who had “buyers remorse” after the FBI’s email announcement to switch their votes to him.

The ABC/Washington Post Poll doesn’t suggest the email fandango has had any significant effect on Clinton’s numbers.

But they do show the Trump slump since the ‘p***y tape’ has abated, and his support is returning.

Either way - the national average has stayed solid since yesterday, with Clinton ahead by 1.9 points.

November 1 - A yuge mistake?

The bookies are rattled.

Two weeks ago, leading British bookmaker Paddy Power announced it was paying out £800,000 to Hillary Clinton backers.

This afternoon they and two other bookies sent out press releases declaring they'd slashed the odds on a Donald Trump presidency. So did Paddy Power make a yuge mistake?

Probably not. Rather than looking at the number of people saying they'll vote one way or another, like polls do, bookies work on the probability of one or other candidate winning. Paddy Power are now giving The Donald. 28% chance of victory, which isn't nothing, but it's not as scary as all that.

In fact it's pretty much the same probability FiveThirtyEight's forecast has given him for the past few weeks.

Of course, if a bunch of people run out and put bets on a guy who's 72% likely to lose, and he loses, they make a tonne of money. So we can't imagine what all these emails are all about.

On to today's averages: Clinton is ahead by 1.9% - but the polls still haven't moved significantly since the FBI story broke on Friday.

FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver suggests the tightening in the polls is more a case of Trump gaining ground than Clinton losing support.

October 31 - Is the email scandal to blame for Hillary's polls slump?

Many are blaming the new email revelations for the recent slump in Hillary Clinton's numbers - but is that true?

Donald Trump has clearly chosen to batter Hillary with the FBI’s email investigation - regardless of the facts of the case. He claimed the FBI had found a “motherlode” of her emails on her aide’s laptop - maybe even the 33,000 he says she deleted.

This not true. The FBI have already said that none of the emails are to or from Hillary Clinton. But hey-ho, when have facts ever mattered in an election?

Anyway, it’s still too early to tell what effect - if any - the email thing will have on the polls. None of the polls conducted since the story broke have shown a huge shift compared to polls taken in the days leading up to it. Whatever has caused her poll numbers to dip, it was in the water before the email issue went public.

But it’s true that the gap between the two candidates has been narrowing over recent days. The TPM poll tracker is showing a drastic shift in their rolling average over the last week.

Hillary’s down to a 1.6 point lead over the Donald this evening - that puts her within the margin of error for the first time in more than a month.

Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton has secured the crucial endorsement of Baywatch and Knight Rider star David Hasselhoff.

He says she’d make a “really good president.”

October 27 - Hillary takes 14 point lead...but could Trump still be in with a shot?

Reuters Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton

Just 12 days out from the election, Hillary Clinton has racked up a dramatic 14 point lead in a poll from Associated Press-GfK.

But not everyone has been so optimistic for Clinton.

CNN's decision desk has moved a bunch of states back into "battleground" status - the most potentially problematic for Clinton being Florida.

Before this morning the news network had the Sunshine State - which carries 29 electoral votes - in the "leans Democrat" column.

They've also shifted Nevada - with 6 electoral votes - from leaning Democrat to 'toss up'.

Meanwhile, some newspapers are giving a lot of attention to an IBD/TIPP poll, which give Clinton a lead of just 0.6%.

It's being given prominence because of a claim that the IBD poll has "most accurately predicted" the last three elections.

That's not true. While polling guru Nate Silver listed them in his top performing pollsters in 2012, they got Obama's margin out by 2.3 points.

They were also pretty widely out in 2008, but in 2004 they were in the top 3.

It's possible people keep saying the Investor's Business Daily's poll is the most accurate because the Investor's Business Daily keep doing so themselves.

Turning to the averages - for which RCP haven't included either of the above polls - Hillary has taken a dip in the last few days, but is still a solid 6.1 points clear.

October 22 - Hillary given a 12-point lead

An ABC phone survey of 874 likely voters gave Hillary Clinton a 12-point lead - 50% to 38%.

It also found 71% of women disapprove of how Trump handled questions about his treatment of women.

October 19 - Hillary ahead in some surprising places

Reuters Hillary Clinton

Every US election comes down to the swing states - but nobody seriously expected Clinton to win big in Republican regions of the country.

But a poll released today puts her 5 points ahead of Donald Trump in Arizona, which has been a solid Red State since 1996 - and has voted Republican in 15 out of the last 16 elections.

Meanwhile Nevada, a key battleground state which has voted Republican in 6 out of the last 10 elections, Clinton leads Trump by 2 points.

And in the overall national poll average, Clinton has soared ahead to a 9 point lead ahead of tonight's final TV debate.

That's going to be a tough hill to climb for the Donald. He's only got 20 days to make up ground and his "October Surprise" - the leak of emails from Clinton's campaign manager through WikiLeaks - is not getting the traction he might have hoped for.

October 16 - Trump takes a nosedive

Video loading Click to play Tap to play The Live Event you are trying to watch is either unavailable or has not started Please refresh this page in your browser to reload this live event video

Donald Trump's numbers have taken a serious nosedive this week.

He's been flattened by an avalanche of sexual assault claims - and hasn't really tried to dig himself out.

Meanwhile, Michelle Obama piled in with what many are describing as the speech of the campaign, saying the Donald's boasting about women had "shaken me to my core".

In the most dramatic poll, an NBC/Wall Street Journal survey of 1,000 registered voters on October 10-13, Hillary Clinton surged 11 points ahead .

The Democrat left her Republican rival trailing with 48% of the vote to his 37%.

The poll put Libertarian Gary Johnson at 7% and the Green Party's Jill Stein at 2%. In a two-horse race Mrs Clinton would be 10 points ahead on 51% to 41%.

Most individual polls from the past week have put Clinton ahead by between 4 and 7 points, with Trump's numbers crashing dramatically.

But there's one online poll taken from October 11th to 13th by Rasmussen which gives Trump a 2 point lead.

Overall, Talking Points Memo's poll average gives Clinton an 8.5 point lead on 46.5%, with Trump trailing on 38%.

October 10 - The 'p****' tape and the second debate

It's been a rocky couple of weeks for the Donald.

The revelation of 'hot mic' tapes of him making unpleasant comments about women has hit his campaign hard.

On top of that, he gave a rather grouchy performance in last night's second TV debate - which may have written off any goodwill his ticket gained from a more solid showing by running mate Mike Pence last week.

All of this has added up to a 3.8 point overall lead for Clinton in the TPM averages.

And in the NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll published today, which is the first where the polling was completely undertaken after the 'p****' tape was released, gave Clinton an 11 point lead among likely voters.

September 28-30 - Post TV debate polls

Video loading Watch next Watch this video again Watch Next Click to play Tap to play The Live Event you are trying to watch is either unavailable or has not started Please refresh this page in your browser to reload this live event video

Hillary Clinton opened up a three-point lead over Donald Trump in a Politico/Morning Consult poll - the first to be conducted after Monday night's fiery debate with Donald Trump.

The first of two presidential TV debates drew a record 84 million viewers - record ratings for a TV debate.

Nine percent of viewers said they had changed their minds according to the survey, published on Wednesday.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll released the same day suggested Secretary Clinton won the debate - with 56% saying sh did a better job.

Of those who thought Clinton won, 22% were Republicans.

Meanwhile, a new NBC poll suggests that since the TV debate Donald Trump has lost support with women voters.

He may have said "I will be the best for women", but 27% of likely women voters said the debate made them think more negatively of Mr Trump.

Nearly a third said their impression of Clinton had improved.

During the debate, Clinton accused Trump of having referred to former Miss Universe Alicia Machado as "Miss Piggy", after claims she had gained weight.

September 21 - The closest since June

The latest polls show the race is the closest it has been since June.

Hillary Clinton is ahead - but only just.

She's currently just 2.1% ahead of Donald Trump - with 44.5% to Trump's 42.4%.

And the most recent IPSOS Mori poll puts both candidates on 39% - with 22% undecided or planning to vote for other candidates.

The polls have only been this close twice before. In July, Trump was briefly behind by 0.5 points, and in May he was briefly behind by just 1.2 points.

But on each occasion a series of gaffes by the former reality TV host - combined with Hillary securing the backing of former nomination rival Bernie Sanders - to open up a double digit lead.

This time, however, matters may be different. Questions over Secretary Clinton's health aren't going away, after she admitted a diagnosis of pneumonia.

And Trump's populist support doesn't appear to be waning - despite hinting at Hillary Clinton's potential assassination for a second time last week.

Speaking at a campaign rally on Friday, billionaire Trump told supporters that his Democratic rival should have her bodyguards disarmed and then mused: "Let's see what happens to her."
