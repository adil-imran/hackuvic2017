Matthew Dow believes his cancer saved him from the Dunblane massacre

A former Dunblane schoolboy has told how he avoided becoming a victim of the massacre because he was in hospital battling leukaemia .

In his first interview since the tragedy, Matthew Dow said he was having chemotherapy when 16 classmates and a teacher were killed.

The 26-year-old added: “I believe cancer saved my life.”

Matthew was just five when parents Nancy and Ian took him to hospital with suspected tonsillitis.

He was instead diagnosed with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and had to undergo eight months of chemotherapy.

Thankfully, several months later, he was in remission.

But on March 13, 1996, while Matthew was still having treatment, Thomas Hamilton entered the gym at Dunblane Primary School and shot at the youngsters and their teacher.

And there was more trauma ahead for Matthew, who needed stitches after being hit by a car days before his 10th birthday.

His parents feared the tragedy would crush their little boy's spirit and let the illness win.

After moving to Annan, Dumfries and Galloway, several years ago, Matthew is helping support vulnerable people in his community through a local cafe project and backing a drive to raise money for a mental health charity .

He'll never forget the tragedy that took away his school friends, including his best friend, Megan Turner, or his two-year battle with cancer, but he says he wants to put the past behind him and focus on his future.

He said: "I've been through hell and back and I'm still here. I believe having cancer saved my life and I'm here twenty years later in good health and have met the love of my life, Lisa.

"I also want to let people know who are struggling with cancer that it can be beaten. It's a hard fight, but it can be beaten."

Matthew was too young to understand the full horror of what had happened

and his parents feared the details could make him weaker in his fight against his illness.

Dad Ian said: "We didn't tell him how ill he was. We were afraid that if he heard it this could be the final straw, and he might give up his fight to go and be with Megan."

The family were elated when medics confirmed Matthew was in remission

several months later.

The effects of the treatment on Matthew's brain have left him with some difficulties. But he knows how lucky he is to have survived two tragedies.

He said: "I was diagnosed with leukaemia in 1995 and when I was in hospital

I noticed a lot of my friends had gone away.

"With what I've been through I've got a borderline personality disorder and autism. I've had my ups and downs but I'm doing well now.

"I was hit by a car three days before my tenth birthday, knocked off my bike and was thrown six feet up in the air and just needed three stitches. It's not my time.

"My teenage years were difficult but I've matured a lot since moving here.

The children in the class were fired at in cold blood

"Stirling scares me when I go back now, I don't really like the hustle and bustle. I like the peace and quiet here, I've got a lovely house and I'm close to the sea.

"I'm engaged to be married and I'm settled now."

As well as volunteering at a project called Kate's Kitchen in Annan, which provides meals and a meeting point for vulnerable people, Matthew is

supporting the amazing charity mission of one man and his dog, who are in

the middle of a 7,000-mile litter pick to raise money for mental health

charity MIND.

After a chance meeting with Matthew and his partner as they passed through

Annan, Matthew is helping his new friends raise as much money as possible

for a charity close to his own heart.

As well as picking up litter on his own walks now, Matthew is helping Wayne

spread awareness.

He said: "He is such an inspiration. Everyone goes walking and if you've got a dog, just take a bin bag with you and fill it up along the way."

"Mind the mental health charity is brilliant, although I've not had dealings with Mind personally I have had support from other organisations.

"I've started collecting rubbish myself. I want to raise awareness for mental health charities and try to give something back."
