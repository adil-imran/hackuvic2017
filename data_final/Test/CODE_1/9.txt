Police in Des Moines, Iowa, confirmed that two area officers were shot and killed early Wednesday morning in what appeared to be ambush-style attacks.

The Des Moines Police Department said in a news release that officers responded to a report of gunfire at about 1:06 a.m. CT and found an Urbandale Police Department officer who had been shot and killed. At 1:26, a second shooting took place several blocks away, and a Des Moines officer was killed, police said. That officer was declared dead at Iowa Methodist Medical Center.

Des Moines Police Sgt. Paul Parizek said both officers appear to have been shot while sitting in their cars. Parizek added that there is "literally a clear and present danger," for metro police. He said that officers are doubling up on patrols for safety.

“It doesn’t look like there was any interaction between these officers and whoever the coward is who shot them while they sat in their cars,” Parizek said.

Police were still notifying the family members of the slain officers early Wednesday and planned to withhold the officers' names, years of service and other details until later in the day, Parizek said.

"We're always vigilant about our safety, but we've still got to go out there," Parizek said.

For Des Moines, this is the first police officer shot and killed in the line of duty since two officers were gunned down in separate incidents in 1977, the Des Moines Register reported.

Urbandale High School classes were canceled in response to the killings, as one ambush was near the school, officials said.

Police said they are in the process of developing suspect information.

Ben Hammes, Communications Director for Gov. Terry Branstad and Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds, released a statement about the shooting, noting that "an attack on public safety officers is an attack on the public safety of all Iowans.

"We call on Iowans to support our law enforcement officials in bringing this suspect to justice," the statement continued. "Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the police officers who were tragically killed in the line of duty as well as the officers who continue to put themselves in harm’s way.”
