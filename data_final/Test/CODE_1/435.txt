Will fin breid, barley-bree an paintit room. Whan MacLean meets wi's friens in Springburn. Aa thae roses an geeans will turn tae blume. An a black laud frae yont Nyanga. Dings the fell gallows o the burghers doun.

Black an white ane-til-ither mairriet. Mak the vile barracks o thair maisters bare. Sae come aa ye at hame wi freedom. Never heed whit the houdies croak for Doom. In yer hous aa the bairns o Aidam.

Tak the road an seek ither loanins. Wi thair ill-ploys tae sport an play. Nae mair will our bonnie callants. Merch tae war whan our braggarts crousely craw. Nor wee weans frae pitheid an clachan. Murn the ships sailin doun the Broomielaw. Broken faimilies in launs we've hairriet. Will curse 'Scotlan the Brave' nae mair, nae mair.

Roch the win i the clear day's dawin. Blaws the clouds heilster-gowdie owre the bay. But thair's mair nor a roch win blawin. Thro the Great Glen o the warl the day. It's a thocht that wad gar our rottans. Aa thae rogues that gang gallus fresh an gay.

A SCOT fighting alongside Kurds in Syria has resisted Turkish claims that he is a terrorist.

A SCOT fighting alongside Kurds in Syria has resisted Turkish claims that he is a terrorist.





In a video released on the International Freedom Battalion’s (IFB) Facebook page on Friday, the well-spoken man, his face covered, warned Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan people from all over the world “are coming every day to fight the revolution”.





Last week the Turkish government said it would treat any Briton fighting alongside Kurdish groups in Syria as a terrorist.

Reports suggest there are at least six British volunteers in northern Syria fighting Daesh in the IFB. The Scot in the video is thought to be a member of the Bob Crow Brigade, who describe themselves as “proletarian militants who have come from Ireland, Scotland and England to take part in an anti-fascist struggle”.





That group is allied to the US-backed People’s Protection Units (YPG). Turkey, which is concerned about Kurdish claims of autonomy, considers the YPG a terrorist group.





“These are terrorist groups and anyone fighting under their banner will be considered terrorists,” said Yunus Akbaba, a spokesman for Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim.





“It is the responsibility of the countries where they come from to prevent them from joining these groups. Turkish forces will confront them if they are fighting under the banner of terrorist groups, regardless of whether they are members of allied countries.”





In the video the anonymous Scot said the accusation that he and all foreign fighters in the IFB are terrorists was “ridiculous and a complete reversal of the truth”.





Responding directly to the “dictator” Erdogan, the Scot said: “It is you who has waged a bloody war of terror against the only democratic force of this conflict. Your well-documented support and collaboration with Daesh has reached its culmination.”

He alleged that Erdogan and his family had “used human pain and turmoil for your personal and political gains. You have turned the suffering refugee masses into human bargaining chips, in order to blackmail the EU. You have added to your obscene wealth through illegal trade with butchers”.





He went on: “We have come here from all over the world, and more of us are coming every day to fight for the revolution.”

One British IFB volunteer, who uses the pseudonym Macer Gifford, said he hoped the UK government took the “threats” seriously.





“Many [volunteers] are former servicemen that have distinguished themselves in Iraq and Afghanistan. Others are leftist and humanitarians. We aren’t terrorists by any definition of the word,” he told the Telegraph.





“If one of them were to be killed by Turkey then you would see a lot of public anger.”





Since the attempted coup in Turkey on July 15 where rebel soldiers took over tanks and planes in a bid to depose Erdogan, the president has sacked or suspended more than 100,000 and at least 40,000 people have been detained.





Over the weekend Erdogan sought to further consolidate his power base by removing elected mayors and appointing new administrators in two dozen municipalities, mostly in the largely Kurdish south east.
