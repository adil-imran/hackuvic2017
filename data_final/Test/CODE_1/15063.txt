He was a celebrated Scottish explorer and pioneer - but Angus McMillan was also a ruthless murderer who should not be honoured, an Australian MP has claimed.

McMillan, a Scot from Glen Brittle on the Isle of Skye, explored areas of Australia in the 1830s, and a district of western Gippsland, Victoria, has long been named after him.

McMillan, who lived from 1810 to 1865, explored Gippsland and even located a suitable harbour, now known as Port Albert.

But he was also a murderer of Australia's indigenous people, and has been linked to a series of massacres in the region.

It has been reported that there were probably more than 2000 of the Kurnai people in Gippsland when McMillan arrived in 1840.

By 1853 there were 131, and by 1857 only 96 - and although no one suggests all died violently, many did.

Now, 150 years after McMillan's death, there are new move for the electoral seat named in his honour to be renamed because of his "well documented" links to the massacres.

McMillan, who arrived in Australia in 1838, and his men are said to be responsible for a number of mass killings including up to 35 at Butcher's Creek and "hundreds" at Bruthen Creek.

Russell Broadbent, the current Liberal MP incumbent of McMillan district - which covers western Gippsland, Victoria - has written to the Electoral Commission, claiming that the change would send a message of practical reconciliation.

He said: "Angus McMillan has a history that is well documented about his murderous ways in regard to our indigenous people and it's time to recognise that.

"I think [the story is] well-known in Gippsland but I don't think it's well-known broadly and I think it's very important that we address issues like this when we get the opportunity to do it

"Over the last few years it has been raised with me on a number of occasions and I have done quite a bit of research and had a look at the situation and realised that the name should be changed."

Mr Broadbent said the seat should be named after Sir John Monash, a former head of the area's electricity commission.

His Labor Party opponent, Chris Buckingham, has backed the campaign, saying: "I think the community recognises that it's inappropriate for us to venerate McMillan's name."

Previously, Pauline Mullett, who represents the Kurnai elders of Gippsland, says McMillan instigated "a lot of massacres", and that "we should not honour a person of his status".

"The electorate should have a Kurnai name," she said.

Professor Ted Cowan, Honorary Prof Research Fellow, School of Interdisciplinary Studies at Glasgow University, author of Scots in Australia: The Gaze from Auld Scotia, said that McMillan had a complicated legacy and was an enigmatic figure.

Initially, he said, McMillan appeared interested in the indigenous peoples of Australia, was then undoubtedly involved in atrocities, and then later in his life was involved in cases where he took their side and tried to protect them.

"When he first arrived he seems to have been fascinated by them, and then he started hunting them down," he said.

"He ended up defending aboriginal rights.

"His story is quite a scar on Scottish memory in Australia, but it should be remembered there were many Scots on the other side, who did much for the indigenous populations."

Professor Cowan said that the call to change the name brought to mind the subject of the statue of the Duke of Sutherland at Golspie, which could, he said, could be pulled down for similar reasons.

The 1st Duke remains a contentious figure for his role in the Highland Clearances.

"Is there not an opinion that by keeping the statue, we can reconsider the crimes?" Professor Cowan said.

"So is it useful to change the name? Maybe the results of keeping the name would allow us to think of what he did."
