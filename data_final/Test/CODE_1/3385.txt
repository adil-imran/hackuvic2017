Almost 20 garment workers were injured on their way to work yesterday morning in Kampong Speu province’s Samrong Tong district after one of the tires of the truck they were in exploded.



Chek Borin, director of the Kampong Speu provincial labor department, said the truck was carrying 31 workers when its tire exploded at 6:20am on Road 44 near Taing Krouch commune’s O’Neang Hing village.



“The total number of workers who were mildly or seriously injured was 19, and we sent 12 to the provincial referral hospital, three to the Khmer-Soviet Friendship Hospital and four to a private clinic to get treatment,” Mr. Borin said, adding that the 11 who were not injured were sent back to their homes after the crash.



“The truck driver could not control the truck when the tire exploded. That’s why the truck crashed and many were injured, but no one died. The National Social Security Fund (NSSF) will be responsible for all payments of the workers’ treatment,” Mr. Borin added.



According to an NSSF report on traffic accidents involving laborers, 2,260 cases involving 2,849 victims were reported in the first quarter of this year. Forty-two workers died in traffic accidents during the same period, while 412 were seriously injured and 2,395 suffered minor injuries.



The report added that the rate of accidents was down 28 percent compared with last year’s first quarter, when 3,122 accidents were reported. In the first quarter of 2015, 70 died in traffic accidents, while another 513 were seriously injured and 2,844 suffered minor injuries.



Last week the Interior Ministry’s National Road Safety Committee (NRSC) set its sights on garment worker safety, imploring drivers to use buses or minivans to transport people to factories instead of the more commonplace open-roofed trucks.



Interior Minister and president of the NRSC Sar Kheng said in a letter that traffic accidents continue to occur because drivers do not respect the newly implemented Traffic Law.



Drivers speed, dangerously overtaking other drivers, overload their vehicles and drive drunk among other offences, Mr. Kheng said, adding that a maximum capacity for trucks carrying workers should be put in place.
