Surrounded by family members of gun crime victims, the US President said there needs to be a balance between Americans' constitutional rights to bear arms and the right to "peacefully live their lives." The US President specifically mentioned the December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in which 20 children and six adults lost their lives. He said, with tears streaming down his face: "Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad." "That changed me, that day. My hope earnestly has been that it would change the country."

Since the Sandy Hook massacre, there have been an estimated 1,044 shootings in the US in which 1,327 people lost their lives. Among the new laws proposed by Mr Obama on Tuesday, any American wishing to purchase a gun would have to pass a strict background check. Mr Obama is also pushing for more gun sellers to get official licenses. Any type of restrictions involving guns is set to face some serious opposition, however. The 2nd Ammendment is something Americans hold very dear and the political risks involved in tinkering with it are huge.

In the wake of Mr Obama's speech, the shares of gunmakers Smith & Wesson Holding Corp and Sturm Ruger &Co Inc have gone up 10 percent and six percent respectively. Some of 2016's presidential hopefuls have already taken to the airwaves and social media to denounce the US President's proposed gun rules. Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio described Mr Obama as "obssessed" with gun control. He said: "Barack Obama is obsessed with undermining the Second Amendment â€” an important protection our Constitution recognizes and defends for us, and he's looking for any way possible to undermine it. He's been doing this forever."
