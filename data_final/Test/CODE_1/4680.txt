Senate to vote to override 9/11 veto

With Zach Montellaro and Connor O’Brien

DRIVING THE DAY — SENATE TO VOTE TO OVERRIDE 9/11 VETO: The Senate is scheduled to vote today for the first time to override a veto by President Barack Obama, over legislation allowing victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to sue Saudi Arabia. Despite concerns raised by senior military officials and several key lawmakers, the veto override is expected to get the needed two-thirds majority, including a vote to override from Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.), we report with Seung Min Kim:

“McCain will vote to override President Barack Obama’s veto of legislation that would allow families of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia — defying warnings from military officials that it could put U.S. troops at risk. McCain’s decision to back the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act is also a notable break from his usual hawkish allies on Capitol [Hill]. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry of Texas has circulated a letter urging Republicans to sustain Obama’s veto, while close friend Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has also voiced concerns and worked behind the scenes on potential tweaks to the bill — but with little success.”

— CARTER AND DUNFORD JOIN OPPONENTS OF THE BILL: Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joe Dunford both expressed their opposition to the 9/11 bill in letters to Thornberry. The letters from Carter and Dunford, obtained by POLITICO, express concerns about the risks to U.S. service members and upsetting the “close security cooperation relationships” with U.S. allies.

“While we are sympathetic to the intent of JASTA, its potential second- and third-order consequences could be devastating to the department and its service members and could undermine our important counterterrorism efforts abroad,” Carter wrote.

— TWEAKS COULD BE COMING IN THE LAME DUCK: Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) told reporters Tuesday that limiting JASTA to just Sept. 11 victims was the “easiest” way to narrow the legislation, but it was still facing opposition from JASTA supporters. He predicted that lawmakers may move to pass a legislative fix to the 9/11 bill in the lame-duck session after the Nov. 8 elections, after observing any potential “blowback” the U.S. ends up facing from foreign governments over the next several weeks.

INCHING TOWARD A SHUTDOWN … OR A SPENDING DEAL? The Senate failed to advance a stopgap spending measure on Tuesday, and now congressional leaders are working to find a compromise to prevent a government shutdown at the end of the fiscal year at midnight Friday, reports our colleagues Kim, Ben Weyl and John Bresnahan: “Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi are trying to hash out an agreement to break an impasse over government funding as the Sept. 30 budget deadline fast approaches.

"In a series of three-way discussions on Tuesday night, the trio of party leaders were forging a compromise to extend government funding until Dec. 9. In turn, Republicans would provide an 'iron-clad commitment' that funding to address the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, will be included in the Water Resources Development Act, which covers hundreds of federal water projects. Late Tuesday, congressional leaders made headway on at least one part of the multi-layered discussions: Pelosi and Ryan agreed to incorporate an amendment to the sweeping waters legislation that would add about $170 million in federal aid for Flint."

MAKING MOVES — HEAD OF THE JUSTICE NATIONAL SECURITY DIVISION TO STEP DOWN, reports POLITICO’s Bryan Bender: Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, the longest-serving head of the Justice Department's National Security Division who has overseen a flurry of high-profile terrorism and cyber espionage cases, will step down next month, officials said. Mary McCord is set to replace him as acting assistant attorney general on Oct. 15. Carlin, 43, joined the National Security Division in 2009, only three years after it was established to consolidate the Justice Department's national security and intelligence functions, and was confirmed as head in 2014.”

WAR REPORT — THE BATTLE FOR ALEPPO HITS THE GROUND, as the Syrian regime sends in ground forces, reports Reuters: “Syrian government forces and their allies attacked the opposition-held sector of Aleppo on several fronts on Tuesday, the biggest ground assault yet in a massive new campaign that has destroyed a U.S.-backed ceasefire. The United States says the assault on Aleppo is proof that President Bashar al-Assad and his Russian and regional allies have abandoned an international peace process to pursue victory on the battlefield after nearly six years of civil war.”

— HOUSE DEMS BACK OBAMA ON SYRIA, writes our colleague Nahal Toosi: “The Obama administration's latest attempt to pacify Syria through diplomacy is failing in spectacularly bloody fashion, raising serious doubts among officials, analysts and others about whether pursuing more talks is worth it. But there's at least one prominent group urging the administration not to give up on negotiations.

“As Syrian and Russian forces laid waste to the northern Syrian city of Aleppo on Tuesday, nearly 60 House Democrats sent a letter to President Barack Obama calling on him to ‘persevere in this diplomatic path.’ ‘There is simply no realistic alternative to a diplomatic and political resolution of the Syrian civil war that takes into account the interests of Syria's diverse communities as well as the interests of all nations in a peaceful, stable Middle East,’ states the letter, a copy of which was obtained by POLITICO.”

— A CHEMICAL WEAPON WASN’T USED NEAR U.S. TROOPS IN IRAQ, via USA Today: “A rocket fired last week at an Iraqi base where American troops are present did not contain a chemical agent despite earlier suspicions, the U.S. military reported Tuesday. Extensive laboratory tests concluded that the munition did not contain mustard agent, Air Force Col. John Dorrian, a U.S. military spokesman, said. No one was killed or injured in the Sept. 20 attack. The shell landed several hundred yards from the nearest U.S. troops.”

MUSICAL APPROPRIATIONS CHAIRS — HAL ROGERS TO SEEK DEFENSE GAVEL: Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), the term-limited Appropriations chairman, is making official what’s been suspected for months: He won’t request a waiver to remain the full committee chairman and will instead seek the Defense Subcommittee gavel. Rogers’ office confirmed his decision on Tuesday, which was first reported by Bloomberg. The move sets the stage for current Defense Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-N.J.) to be the clear frontrunner for the full Appropriations panel next year — and also tees up a showdown between Rogers and Rep. Kay Granger (R-Texas), who also wants the defense gavel.

DOCUMENT DRAWER - WILSON DEMANDS AFGHANISTAN SUPPLEMENTAL. Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.), a senior House Armed Services member, sent a letter to the president, urging him to submit a supplemental funding request for keeping a higher level of troops in Afghanistan than originally planned. "An absence of funding...is irresponsible," Wilson wrote. "As a result, we would have to formulate a new security strategy that accepts the substantial risk of not meeting our defense needs, and places troops in harm's way." The defense secretary said this week a supplemental will likely be submitted to Congress after the Nov. 8 elections.
