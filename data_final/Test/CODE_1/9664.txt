Will Huntsberry is an assistant producer in NPR's elections unit, where he produced a piece about Don Gonyea's favorite campaign trail playlists, reported on the one place in Washington where former House Speaker John Boehner could feel like "a regular guy," and other stories that get beneath the surface of American politics.

He came to NPR in 2014 as Kroc Fellow, after graduating from Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism. Since joining NPR, he has worked on the education desk, reported at KQED in San Francisco, and was part of the team that covered the 2015 church massacre in Charleston, S.C.

Previously, he worked for the Wall Street Journal and covered Raleigh, N.C. for a variety of news outlets.
