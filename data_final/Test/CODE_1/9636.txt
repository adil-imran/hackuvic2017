David Coleman Headley's deposition is being seen by the government as yet another strong evidence to implicate the role of state and non-state actors of Pakistan in 26/11 terror attacks.

Terming Headley's statement as the key to end the ambiguity over the role of Pakistani "state and non-state actors", minister of state for home Kiren Rijiju said, "It is known that who all were involved. Headley's statement will lead to a logical conclusion as it ends the ambiguity. It will help us."

Senior officials said Headley's deposition has clearly brought out the role played Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) officers along with Lashkar-e-Toiba's (LeT) chief Hafiz Saeed and commander Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi and would be used to hand over a fresh dossier to Pakistan.

During his five-hour deposition through video conferencing, Headley reportedly spelt out the names of two ISI officers – Major Ali and Major Iqbal – who connected him to Lashkar recruiter Sajid Mir thereby clearly bringing out the ISI-Lashkar nexus.

The testimony puts a searchlight on the role played by Pakistani state actors who were not even arrested or put to trial.

"It (deposition) is definitely one of the most incriminating evidence as it has been given to the court on oath and without any sort of pressure by us. Once Headley gives his full deposition we will look at it with the help of judicial experts and accordingly share the evidence with Pakistan," said a senior official.

Many senior officials in the security establishment think that the testimony gives India the chance to "name and shame" Pakistan internationally and pressurise it to rein in terror groups.

Conceding that Pakistan is expected to do little, as is evident from giving clean chit to Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar in Pathankot attack case, officials said that New Delhi may use it to raise the pitch at international forums like UN for Pakistan to act and bring perpetrators to justice.

According to independent experts also Headley's testimony should be used to expose Pakistan further as that is the only language it understand and is wary of.

"The deposition of Headley yet again proves to the world community that it is not merely groups like LeT that need to be dealt with expeditiously, but also Pakistan's sponsorship of terrorist groups which it regards as 'strategic assets' and the terror infrastructure that has taken roots in its territory."

"India's approach to dealing with the challenge posed by terrorism has to become multi-dimensional, including diplomatic efforts to isolate state sponsorship of terrorism, dealing with Pakistan pragmatically instead of being driven by sentiment, and strengthened domestic structures," said Vivik Chada of IDSA.
