Reports Sender name: Sender email: Friend's name: Friend's email: Millions view hashtag USA_kills_Yemeni_people



SANA'A, Feb. 16 (Saba) - At least 77 million people have read the tweets on the hashtag "#USA_kills_Yemeni_people" on Facebook and Twitter since January 25.



The hashtag campaign launched by Yemenis, Arabs and foreigner activists on aimed to spotlight the invisible role played by the United States of America (USA) and its involvement in the war crimes committed by the Saudi-Emirati-USA coalition on Yemen since March 2015.



It also intends to unveil the genocide and brutal massacres committed by the coalition against civilians for more than 11 months as well as the US imperialism's role in creating conflicts in the region.



Chairman of the Supreme Revolutionary Committee (SRC) Mohammad al-Houthi officially launched the campaign on January 25, aiming to send a message to the whole world that "USA is the country that kills the Yemeni people inconsistent with all false slogans it claims, and that the coalition's allies are just tools of the USA."



The campaign came after explicit statements issued by US Secretary of State John Kerry in a news conference held in Riyadh with his Saudi counterpart Adel al-Jubeir in mid-January, in which Kerry confirmed Washington's support for Riyadh-led aggression on Yemen.



The Saudi Foreign Minister had previously announced upon a meeting held with his USA and British counterparts in London that the Saudi regime has USA and British military officers in the control and command center of the aggression.
