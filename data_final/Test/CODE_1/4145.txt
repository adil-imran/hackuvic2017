Durban - The constant police presence at protest-hit universities could create a gap for criminals in residential areas, security organisations fear.

While the squads on campus comprise members of the Public Order Police unit, their back-up may come from the canine and task force units, according to Kloof Community Police Forum (CPF) chairman Corne Broodryk.

In Westville, where there is a troubled university campus, CPF spokesman Caz Weeks said it would be par for the course that the focus on universities would impact on neighbouring areas. “If it (#feesmustfall) continues, it won’t take long for the thieves to realise resources are stretched.”

But both said there had not been a noticeable spike in crime linked to the protests.

Satish Dhupelia, of the Sydenham CPF, also said there had been no real increase in crime.

Police spokeswoman Brigadier Sally de Beer was adamant the Public Order Police presence at universities would not affect policing in residential areas.

“We know how to plan accordingly. We always have reserves, even if we have to move them in from another province where things are quieter,” she said. “There is always a Plan B and a Plan C.”

Earlier this month, acting national police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane reportedly said the protests had diverted police resources, and called for a resolution so officers could get back to fighting crime.

Last month, Gauteng portfolio committee on community safety Major-General Eric Nkuna reportedly said the police were committed to fighting crime, but public and government issues were affecting their performance.

“FeesMustFall is a problem. We plan and say we will assist Johannesburg Central (with these resources) and I have to withdraw from (that) because it is FeesMustFall. Once you divert your resources you are not going to achieve your objectives,” the Sunday Times quoted him saying.

“These (protests) are prolonged. There is also land invasion... they become a police baby. I am not here to blame everybody but people must take responsibility... If I am given enough chance to concentrate on crime I will not have a problem” Nkuna said.
