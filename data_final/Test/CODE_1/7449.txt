A small group of people marched to to the Grand Parade today to commemorate the 1960 protest against the pass laws when 30,000 people marched to the city centre from Langa.

The symbolic march was led by veteran Pan Africanist Congress member Philip Kgosana who led the protest on 30 March 1960.

The march took place a few days after the Sharpeville massacre in which 69 people were killed by police. Kgosana, a 23-year-old student at the time, was arrested shortly after the Cape Town march.

“Today’s march is to celebrate the achievement of fighting successfully the use of pass laws which discriminated against black people,” said Khathekile Nontshiza from Makhaza in Khayelitsha. “It is the PAC that freed our people from being oppressed in their own country..”

“It is not about the numbers but conveying the message and giving direction to the people. People need to know the truth about the struggle during apartheid.”
