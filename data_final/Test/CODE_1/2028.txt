According to TMZ, at least two armed bodyguards will now accompany Kim wherever she goes, and her car will be armoured.

The 35-year-old star and her husband Kanye West are beefing up security after she was robbed at gunpoint in Paris last week, and her new detail will include former government protection officers.

After the robbery, which saw the 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' star tied up and locked in her bathroom while the gunmen stole over $10 million worth of jewellery, Kim met with former Israeli army officers, ex-CIA agents and past Secret Service members, while her rapper husband staged meetings with the owners of two top security firms.

Kim's mother and manager Kris Jenner has been heavily involved in the security meetings, and one of her priorities is securing extra bodyguards to protect her daughters Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian and Kendall and Kylie Jenner.

Kim's regular bodyguard, Pascal Douvier - who was out with her sisters Kourtney Kardashian and Kendall Jenner at the time of the robbery - sparked speculation he had been fired a few days ago after removing all traces of the 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' star from his Instagram account.

However, insiders told TMZ that Kim and Kanye - who have children North, three, and Saint, 10 months, together don't blame him for what happened and still trust Pascal implicitly.

Instead, the security guard removed the pictures as a safety measure in order to prevent any future would-be attackers from contacting him or learning more information about Kim's whereabouts.

Pascal was spotted in Chicago at the weekend looking after the 'Famous' rapper, who had a gig in the city.
