HE’S back.He was here in 1962 as a representative of his father (Emperor Showa, aka Hirohito, who was Hitler’s Oriental counterpart in the Axis leadership), and this time (26-29 January 2016) he visited Malacañang whose occupant is not a veteran of the Global Anti-Fascist War.Just before he left Tokyo for Manila, his Majesty remarked: “During World War II, countless Filipino, American, and Japanese lives were lost in the Philippines. A great many innocent Filipino civilians became casualties of the fierce battles fought in the city of Manila. This history will always be in our hearts as we make this visit to the Philippines.” [ http://www.kunaicho.go.jp/e-okotoba/01/address/speech-h28e.html#airport It is good that Doraemon’s Emperor specifically cited the Rape of Manila for which his father’s imperial military commanders were liable and held to account. As reported: “MANILA, Nov. 1 — The United States Military Commission which is hearing the case against General Yamashita to-day was told how the Japanese crowded many of the city’s most beautiful women into the best hotels at bayonet-point, and forced them to submit to Japanese Marines returning from the front line. Many of these women gave evidence, but their identity was not revealed. They said that brothels were organized even when American forces held more than half the city.” [The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW), Friday, 02 November 1945, page 3]At the state dinner held in his honor at the Rizal Ceremonial Hall, Malacañan Palace, January 27, Megu Aoshima’s Emperor toasted: “Last year Japan marked the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. During this war, fierce battles between Japan and the United States took place on Philippine soil, resulting in the loss of many Filipino lives and leaving many Filipinos injured. This is something we Japanese must never forget and we intend to keep this engraved in our hearts throughout our visit.” [ http://www.gov.ph/2016/01/27/toast-emperor-akihito/ Yes, your Majesty, Filipino lives were lost in the Lipa Massacre, Bataan Death March and Rape of Mapanique, among others. As reported: “MANILA, Fri. — The bayoneting of children was described today by a tragic black-clad mother in the Yamashita trial. She was Apolinaria Navarro, and gave evidence with an infant in her arms. She told how her 10-year-old son and her 6-year-old daughter were torn from her arms and bayoneted by the Japs in the Batangas massacre on Feb. 12. She saw a neighbor’s child tossed in the air by a Japanese soldier and caught on a bayonet, and a number of Japanese fell upon her and live bayonets pierced, her body.” [The Mercury (Hobart), Saturday, 10 November 1945, page 4]Karawan-kun’s Emperor in his private meeting with Pia Wurtzbach’s President “talked about the Emperor’s previous visit to the Philippines, including Baguio and Tagaytay; heavier traffic volume in (the National Capital Region) due to increased automobile sales, mostly of Japanese make; and significant presence of Japanese retailer Uniqlo and the Heattech technology,” Presidential Communications Operations Office Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr. told reporters. [ https://sg.news.yahoo.com/japan-royals-pay-tribute-phl-000000809.html Perhaps in their next conversation, these gentlemen can discuss the upgrading of Japanese and Philippine school books to better reflect historical reality: heroism of Filipino guerrillas, Kempeitai, Los Baños Raid, Hirohito’s declaration of war against the US and the UK, Wenceslao Q. Vinzons, International Military Tribunal in the Far East, Josefa Llanes-Escoda, Japanese Imperial Army Unit 731, Jose Abad Santos, and Tokyo’s wartime military sexual slavery system. After all, the archives are accessible online. For instance: “The prosecution at the Yamashita trial read a US Army 14th Corps report quoting a Japanese military order, which stated that Filipino women and children were to be considered as guerrillas and all slain. An extract from the diary of a Japanese soldier dated 9/2/45 read: ‘We burned to death 1,000 guerrillas tonight’.” [Australian Associated Press (Manila), “JAP ORDER TO SLAY FILIPINO WOMEN,” The Argus (Melbourne), Friday, 16 November 1945, page 20; http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/12153347 Nikkolin’s Emperor laid flowers at the Heroes’ Cemetery (Libingan ng mga Bayani), reportedly a simple yet meaningful gesture for Filipinos. “As you know, the emperor express[ed] his profound remorse to the loss of lives of many Filipinos when the fight was done in 1945 between the Japanese army and the U.S. armies,” Hatsuhisa Takashima, press secretary to the emperor, said. [ http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/01/27/Japan-imperial-couple-emperor-... We may agree. And now we shall see how loyal Japanese diplomats, Japanese corporate honchos and Japanese representatives in the Philippines are to their monarch. Will they also pay their respects to the heroes and heroines who successfully resisted the fascist Japanese invasion of Rizal’s homeland during WW2?Shimanekko’s Emperor bowed to a war memorial in Laguna, mourning the largest number of Japanese invasion troops who died outside their native soil in World War II. [Bullit Marquez (Associated Press), “Emperor Akihito Honors Japanese War Dead in Philippines,” 29 January 2016] We wonder if Tsunoda and the 169 other relatives of the Japanese soldiers will also be moved to tears when they learn of the brutalities inflicted by Hirohito’s obedient troops on defenseless civilians. For instance: “MANILA, Wednesday. Giving evidence at the trial of General Yamashita, the Rev. Father Belarmino Decells told of the torture and massacre of 6,000 Filipino and Chinese civilians by Japanese troops in February last before Manila fell.”“The Priest said that the Japanese jammed civilians into St. Augustine Church. Men we’re thrown into dungeons and women and children were kept without food in the church com pound until they were so hungry that they ate grass and roots. Four days later the men were taken out forced to stand in open streets under heavy artillery fire and then marched to Fort Santiago where burnings and slayings took place.” [ http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/2650987 “Juan Paloda, a Filipino laborer, declared that he was one of 100 who was packed in a dungeon, 25 feet square. Later he was stabbed and left for dead in a pit with 500 other bodies.” [“PRIEST TELLS OF JAP BRUTALITY AT MANILA,” The Canberra Times (ACT), Thursday, 08 November 1945, page 1]We thank Kuma-mon’s Emperor for visiting and we pray that His Majesty’s loyal subjects (particularly the Rightists so feared by the Bridge for Peace) will be enlightened, too.
