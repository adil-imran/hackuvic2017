It was 71 years ago today that Auschwitz concentration camp was liberated. And today pupils from all over east, central and south Devon came to Exeter to mark Holocaust Memorial Day.

The all day event includes an opening ceremony, exhibition and guided events held at the Guildhall. Followed by student presentations and survivor talks at Southernhay United Reformed Church.

The church welcomed year 9 and 10 students who had been studying the holocaust, from Cullmopton, Uffculme, Exmouth, Okehampton, Exeter and Torquay. They read poems, prayers, songs and performed plays and readings, as well as a musical performance to be sung by Torquay schools choir.

The students focused on events from the Holocaust with themes of hope, defiance and courage.

Okehampton College Teacher Mike Gurney said, “These themes the children are discussing, of not being bystanders are particularly potent today with the conflict in Syria. Schools need to tackle prejudice whether that is racism, sexism or homophobia, among others.”

There were also showings of Plymouth & Devon Racial Equality Council's film ‘Porajmos: The Untold Story of the Gypsy Holocaust’ with discussions led by Gypsy/Roma educators.

And Bosnian genocide survivor Kemal Pervanic talked about his experiences. Followed later by Auschwitz-Birkenauw concentration camp survivor, Leslie Kleinman.

Kemal had been held in the Omarska concentration camp during the conflict in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. The ensuing genocide ethnic cleansing saw around 100,000 people killed by 1995, the largest massacre since in Europe since 1945.

Kemal said, “The worst aspect of being kept in the Omarska camp was the fact that the place was guarded by my former schoolmates, former neighbours, former policemen on whose protection I relied before the war, and even former teachers.”

The events were planned by Devon SAXRE, Devon Faith and Belief Forum, Exeter City Council and Devon County Council.
