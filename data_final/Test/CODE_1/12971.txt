Bloody ISIS Strikes Again: 250 Women Murdered for Refusing to Become Sex Slaves

You've got bad people, you've got psychopaths, and then you have the monsters calling themselves ISIS, the terrorist organization occupying large parts of Syria and Iraq.

We all knew that ISIS doesn't respect human life at all. We also already knew that the terrorist thugs commit large massacres in which innocent civilians are butchered. We are aware of those facts and have learned to deal with it.

But imagine this: in the city of Mosul alone, at least 250 innocent women were murdered in cold blood because they refused to become sex slaves. Human Rights Voices explains:

The Islamic State group, also known as ISIS, has executed at least 250 women in northern Iraqi city of Mosul in Nineveh province for refusing sex slavery, according to reports Wednesday. The women had been ordered to accept “temporary marriages” to the militants, and were all put to death after their refusal. Said Mamuzini, an official from the Kurdistan Democratic Party, told the AhlulBayt News Agency that sometimes the families of the women were also executed for rejecting to submit.

According to Sharia, a man is only allowed to have sex with his wives, or with female, non-Muslim slaves. However, the terrorists of ISIS love rape so much that they found a solution: they force Islamic women to "marry" them for a night and divorce them in the morning. They're free to do whatever they please with those women in the hours in between.

These bloodthirsty butchers couldn't care less about other human beings, not even about innocent women brave enough to reject the terrorist psychopaths who wish to use them for one night and throw them away afterwards.

It's incredibly brave that these 250 women (and there might be more) chose this fate -- death over rape -- but it's incredibly sad that the United States and Europe are letting it happen. Mosul could have been liberated months ago if only the anti-ISIS coalition took the war against the radical Islamic terrorists seriously.

Instead, President Obama boasts that he won't send troops to Iraq. He believes that Iraqi forces themselves, with some training and other help from the U.S., might be able to take back Mosul at the end of the year, or even in 2017:

"As we see the Iraqis willing to fight and gaining ground, let's make sure that we're providing them more support," Obama said, in an interview to CBS News, according to Agence France-Presse. "We're not doing the fighting ourselves, but when we provide training, when we provide special forces who are backing them up, when we are gaining intelligence -- working with the coalitions that we have -- what we've seen is that we can continually tighten the noose," he added.

This self-declared defender of women and their emancipation is now trusting the fate of these women to his complete failure of an anti-terror strategy.
