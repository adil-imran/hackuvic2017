Senior faculty members in Delhi government's Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC) are up in arms against the recent transfer of eight of its doctors to central government-run hospitals in Delhi.

On Monday, the doctors decided to approach Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung requesting him to look into the matter. The decision was taken at the general body meeting of the faculty association on Monday.

HEALTH MINISTRY PUNISHES DOCTORS?



"Last time, a delegation from the faculty association of MAMC had met the L-G against the order of the health department by which the health minister and his staff were to occupy the heritage building of MS Lok Nayak Hospital," said a senior doctor from the hospital, requesting anonymity.

"Now, all these faculty members have been punished with their transfer orders and sent to the central government hospitals. This is totally unjustified," the doctor added.

In June, doctors of the MAMC had strongly opposed the Delhi government's move to shift the office of the Delhi health minister to the space where critical functions are carried out. The doctors had said that the move would compromise patients' safety and quality of healthcare.

The doctors had then written a letter to Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Jain requesting him to withdraw the order. The medical representatives also threatened to go on strike, if the orders were not withdrawn.

GOVT DENIES IMPLEMENTING ANY SUCH ORDER



However, the government had denied implementing any such order. "No such order has been implemented as of now. We will consult doctors of Lok Nayak Hospital before taking any such decision. The government does not have any wrong intention," a Delhi government spokesperson had said.

"The Delhi government hospitals are already facing shortages of doctors and at a time when cases of vector-borne diseases are already at a high, transferring doctors from the hospitals doesn't seem to be a wise decision," a senior Delhi government official told Mail Today.

Delhi is already witnessing a health crisis with cases of chikungunya increasing. So far the national Capital has reported 8,456 cases of chikungunya and 2,711 cases of dengue.

While cases of dengue are comparatively lower, cases of chikungunya and malaria are making life difficult for the people and the health department.

At least 30 people have died due to chikungunya in Delhi and surrounding areas this year. The state government had even earned the ire of the High Court over its tussle with the L-G at such a crucial time.
