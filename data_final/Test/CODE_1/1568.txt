This comes after Now magazine alleged Kieran was feeling 'emasculated' by his wife after she was seen leaving a hotel with reality star Scotty.

'Kieran can't handle anymore humiliation. Katie's ditched the woman he married and replaced her with Jordan', the insider said.

'The pictures of her with Scotty just add to the problems for Kieran. He confronted her, accusing her of double standards and blatantly flirting.'

MailOnline has contacted Katie's representative for comment.

An old tweet of Scotty's from 2015 has also resurfaced, in which he tells Katie to ditch Kieran for him.

He wrote: '@MissKatiePrice needs to bin that k**b off and just get with me like #PuaMilf'.

Scotty denied the claims of a secret hotel tryst with Katie, writing in his Daily Star column: 'She is married with kids and I respect that'

Scotty denied the claims of a secret hotel tryst with Katie, writing in his Daily Star column: 'Yes, of course I would bang her, she is FIT.

'She is also a wicked woman and a laugh to be around. But she is married with kids and I respect that'.

This comes after Katie took to her Instagram account on Saturday to rubbish claims her marriage to Kieran is in trouble.

Wearing a pair of oversized black shades, she calmly says in the close-up video: 'I'd just like to clarify that no ex bought me this necklace, he wouldn't be able to afford it. I bought it myself.

Therapy: The pair will be going to couples therapy in the near future, but she insists they're on the right track

'And me and Kieran are happily married with no problems. Thank you.'

During Friday's Loose Women, Katie almost mistakenly referred to Kieran as ex-husband Peter Andre.

Announcing that she is taking a break from the public eye, eagle eyed viewers noticed Katie wearing the unique horse jewellery her ex cage-fighter beau gave her.

While fans spotted that Katie appeared to be wearing a diamond necklace that her former flame Alex gifted her at their 2010 wedding as she hinted her current marriage was in trouble.

Having featured on their ITV reality show For Better For Worse, sources told the Mirror said the choice of necklace sent mixed messages.

The insider said: 'It is the ultimate smack in the face to Kieran.

'Wearing a piece of expensive jewellery from an ex husband while she explained her marriage was in trouble doesn't exactly send out the right message.'

Katie and Alex called it quits in 2012, after she claimed 'unreasonable behaviour' for their divorce.

Over the past two weeks, she's successfully whipped up an avalanche of headlines while promoting her revealing new book Reborn, telling all about her heartbreak.

But Katie Price has now revealed that speaking so candidly about her husband Kieran Hayler's affairs with two of her best friends has taken its toll.

During an appearance on ITV's Loose Women on Friday, the former glamour model announced that she's taking a month-long break from the limelight to heal her reopened wounds - which she'll deal with during couples therapy sessions.

She explained: 'We're gonna go back to a therapist, not because there's anything wrong with our relationship... He's realised now I've moved on, how much he's hurt me. It's a lot for him to deal with.

'Everything, all in my life, I've never really sat down and spoken about it (with a therapist).'

She added: 'We had therapy at the time (of Kieran's cheating) and I thought I was over it... The past two weeks, I've been back on my book tour, it's reopened new wounds. I've had to talk about it.'

Late honeymoon: The couple will also be heading off next week for a late honeymoon

However, while she insisted multiple times throughout the show's broadcast that she and Kieran are not splitting, she did mistakenly refer to him as ex-husband Peter Andre.

After her initial announcement of taking a break, Kieran sent a video message from his phone, in which he said: 'Hi babes, I love you and I'm so proud of you and I'm going to support you through everything. I love you.'

Katie jokingly fired back: 'You're the one who did the damage!'

Oops! During her time on the show, Katie mistakenly referred to Kieran as her ex Peter Andre

Testing times: Katie explained that speaking about her husband's cheating so extensively two-and-a-half years later has tested her and her spouse emotionally

When asked by her co-hosts if she'll ever forgive him, she said: 'I'll never forgive him. Never forget... But I wanna clarify me and Kieran - oops, I almost said Pete then - are absolutely fine. It's just been hard emotionally for both of us.'

She also confessed that her move to expand her boobs to a new bra-busting size - much like her old alter ego Jordan - was likely because of insecurities.

The mother-of-five said: 'The boobs had nothing to do with what's happened with the book. I will admit people see me going out in more skimpy stuff.

Demure: Katie displayed her slimline physique in a comparably demure ensemble

Heartbroken: Katie broke Kieran's heart when he cheated on her with two of her best friends

'When I met Kieran, my body was small and normal and then I had two babies back-to-back and gained weight... The two women he had affairs with were smaller... Now I'm back to where I was and maybe it's like, "Now I'm back to where you want me."

'I am insecure. I am vulnerable. It's kind of a relief for me to admit I'm not as strong as people think. I have to put a barrier up. But enough's enough now.

'I'm not disappearing for ages, just a few weeks... We're just going away on a belated honeymoon, just me and Kieran and the kids and enjoy some horses.

'I want to help Kieran through this as well, because it's tough for us both... I do trust him, but because of all this book stuff there's turbulence.'

Squad: She spoke candidly with panellists (l-r) Kaye Adams, Linda Robson and Nadia Sawalha

Sympathetic: She received support from the Loose Women team as she shared the news

Let's hug it out: The mother-of-five later shared a hug with Linda, who called her a 'great mum'

The first moment that she realised how gruelling it might be to relive the trauma was when her legal team advised her to read through her book and she couldn't face it.

'It's just something I don't want to relive again,' she said. 'It's just absolutely awful, torture.'

She also explained that she got through many of her past pains by putting up a defence mechanism.

'If I'm hurt, I try and answer it in a jokey-bantery way to look like I can handle it... I haven't got any tears to cry. My heart is shattered.'

Rude boy: She also took the opportunity to shoot down rumours of an affair with Scotty T

Just friends: Despite rumours to the contrary, Katie insisted that she and Scotty are just friends

But she's also been feeling sorry for Kieran - despite the damage of his past actions.

'It's also been hard for Kieran,' she said. 'He's changed in two-and-a-half years... I've had to relive it with a fresh mind and go, "Oh my god, this is what he did to me."'

Kieran's indiscretions stayed close to Katie's mind, as later on in the show, when Anne Diamond came on as a guest, she made further confessions when the TV veteran spoke about being cheated on.

'Sometimes, it crosses my mind that I want to hurt him back,' said Katie of Kieran. 'Sometimes, I just want him to feel the pain that I had.'

Feeling sorry: Despite Kieran's cheating, Katie said that she feels terribly for her husband

Raunch: Katie also apologised for her recent return to wild public behaviour and raunchy attire

During the show, she also took some time to shoot down rumours that she'd had a fling with Scotty T.

'This has dragged on,' she said, looking exasperated as she explained that the Geordie Shore star had taken her and a friend to a sunbed.

She recalled: 'Afterwards he asked if he could come and change in my room because he had a event to get to in Blackpool. While he was in there I was just getting my hair done and that’s it. We’re just friends.

Warning: During the show, Nadia revealed that she'd advised Katie against going on the tour

Chaos: She also pointed out Katie's string of chaotic relationships since her split with Peter

'We had people in room. I shouldn't have to justify myself. I'm married. I'm not gonna do that.'

Katie's fellow panellists also asked if Kieran trusted her, to which she answered: 'I feel like he might wonder if I'll go and do something because of all the book stuff.'

Directing her apologies to the public about her recent antics, she said: 'I'm sorry if I offended anyone with my pictures and behaviour. But I'm human... I don't wanna talk about the past anymore. I just need to move on.'

She added: 'It took me 23 years to admit that I am vulnerable and I do have insecurities... I'm self-destructive sometimes, but I'm human.'

Opening up: She revealed that this will be the first time she candidly talks through her issues

Having a laugh: Katie admitted that she'd previously joked her way out of serious discussion

Despite her efforts to save their marriage, Katie appeared remarkably considerate of his possible future should they ever break up.

Speaking later in the show about vasectomies, she admitted that she wouldn't want him to go through with the procedure, just in case he wanted children with somebody else.

Katie said: 'Once we've had all our kids I'd be happy to do it. But I don't think I'd want him to. You don't know what's going to happen...

'What if we split and he met someone and wanted to reverse his vasectomy and I went off and had a baby with somebody else? It would kill him.'
