A British TV producer is coming under mounting pressure to release tapes of the American version of The Apprentice which reportedly show Donald Trump using the N-word.

Supporters of Hillary Clinton are asking Mark Burnett to make public the recordings of the hit TV series, which the Republican presidential candidate hosted on NBC between 2004 and last year.

The tapes are said to show things that are ‘far worse’ than the 2005 recording of Mr Trump released on Friday, which showed him celebrating sexually assaulting women.

Alan Sugar, who presents the UK version of The Apprentice, called for the tapes to be released. He wrote on Twitter: ‘I’m willing to bet NBC has some gems on Trump [from] 11 years [of The] Apprentice.’

Addressing Hillary Clinton, Lord Sugar added: ‘Go ask @nbc to study all non-broadcast material of Donald when he was doing the Apprentice and encourage them to publish.’

He also wrote: ‘Hi @MarkBurnettTV do USA a favour and get the non-broadcast unofficial rushes of Trump while recording the Apprentice. There must be loads.’

Mr Burnett, 56, was born in London and now lives in the US.

The committed Christian, who served as a paratrooper in the Falklands War, reportedly has the tapes – but is said to be close to Mr Trump and has allegedly said he will sue for $5million (£4,045,000) anyone who leaks them.

David Brock, a ‘mega-donor’ for Mrs Clinton, has said he would pay the money if it meant the material being aired.

Among those who have said there is dirt on the recordings is Bill Pruitt, an Emmy Award-winning producer, who wrote on Twitter: ‘As a producer on seasons one and two of The Apprentice I assure you: when it comes to the Trump tapes, there are far worse.’

Writing about the unconfirmed reports suggesting that Mr Trump used a racial slur, Chris Nee, an Irish-American children’s TV producer, tweeted: ‘Hearing from producers and crew the “N word” is the “much worse”.’

But this tweet later disappeared and she added: 'Folks, I have never worked on The Apprentice. I don't know what's out there. Or what still exists. I've heard rumors. Would love to know.’

Last night a joint statement was issued by Mr Burnett and MGM, which owns his production company, insisting Mr Burnett ‘does not have the ability nor the right to release [the] footage’ and that MGM was restricted by contracts and ‘legal requirements’.

Insiders have previously claimed Mr Trump rated female contestants on The Apprentice by the size of their breasts and discussed which he would like to sleep with.

Ex-contestant Gene Folkes recalled the 70-year-old calling for female contestants to wear more revealing dresses.

Former senior producer Katherine Walker said Mr Trump frequently talked about women’s bodies during the five seasons she worked with him.

The Trump campaign said all the allegations were ‘outlandish and false and fabricated’. The claims came as the most powerful Republican in Congress last night turned on Mr Trump and said he would no longer defend him.

THE CHRISTIAN, PARA AND REALITY TV PIONEER Mark Burnett, 56, who was born in London and now lives in the US, is a former paratrooper who served in the Falklands War and went on to become one of the pioneers of reality TV. He and his wife, the Northern Ireland actress Roma Downey, are committed Christians who have produced a string of Bible-themed films and TV series, including the movie Son of God. The latter attracted controversy because the actor who played Satan looked like Barack Obama. Downey supported former Sinn Fein leader Martin McGuinness’s unsuccessful bid for the Irish presidency in 2011.

According to CNN, Speaker Paul Ryan said he would not campaign with his party’s nominee and would focus on keeping control of the House – a tacit admission that he thinks Mr Trump will lose.

The Speaker is the presiding officer in the House of Representatives and leader of the majority party there. He is second in the line of succession after the vice-president, if the serving president dies.

Mr Ryan’s remarks are yet another blow to Mr Trump’s support among Republicans. More than three dozen governors, senators and representatives said they will not vote for him or have revoked their endorsements since the 2005 video emerged on Friday.

In the footage Mr Trump said he liked to grab women ‘by the p****’ and that ‘when you’re a star … you can do anything’. Mr Ryan said he was ‘sickened’ by what he had heard.

In a conference call yesterday with senior Republicans, the Speaker did not revoke his endorsement of Mr Trump but said his focus was on state and gubernatorial races. He told them: ‘Do what’s best for you.’

Those who turned their backs on Mr Trump include Senator John McCain, ex-Florida governor Jeb Bush and Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of State under George W Bush.

But his vice-presidential running mate Mike Pence told CNN that suggestions he would leave the Trump campaign were ‘absolutely false’.

Mr Trump kept his battered political dreams alive on Sunday, flinging dirt at Hillary Clinton in the most vicious presidential debate in living memory.

In the 90-minute slanging match, a pacing Mr Trump accused Mrs Clinton of having ‘tremendous hate in her heart’. The pair refused to shake hands at the beginning.

Mrs Clinton claimed the controversy over Mr Trump’s lewd remarks was part of a pattern of misogyny.

But he dismissed them as ‘locker room talk’, and tried to focus on the sexual misdemeanours of Bill Clinton – who sat in an audience that included three of his female accusers.

Mr Trump accused him of sexually assaulting or harassing a string of women. He also accused Mrs Clinton of smearing her husband’s accusers to discredit their claims.

It later emerged the Trump campaign tried to compound the embarrassment for the Clintons by putting the three accusers – Kathleen Willey, Juanita Broaddrick and Paula Jones – in the Trump family’s box.

Mr Trump turned the discussion to his rival’s controversial use of a private email server while Secretary of State. Some 33,000 deleted emails have never been recovered.

He told her ‘if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation’.

When Mrs Clinton said it was ‘awfully good’ someone with Mr Trump’s temperament was not in charge of US law, he replied: ‘Because you’d be in jail.’
