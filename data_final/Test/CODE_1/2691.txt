Joaquim Levy's arrival comes as Brazil’s deepest recession in more than a century is becoming a source of growing anxiety at both the bank and the IMF.

Washington: The World Bank is bringing one of the architects of a new Chinese-led rival into its management ranks and appointing recently departed Brazilian finance minister Joaquim Levy as its new chief financial officer.

Jim Yong Kim, the World Bank’s president, is due to announce early next week that Shaolin Yang will take up a new post as the bank’s chief administrative officer, sources said on Friday. Yang heads the Chinese ministry of finance’s office of international cooperation and was one of the key officials behind the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

His appointment as well as that of Levy would fill voids left by the unexpected resignations late last year of two of the bank’s senior executives. They also would bolster the ranks of executives from key emerging economies in the bank’s senior management at an important time in the relationship with China and Brazil.

The launch of the AIIB, which is due to be inaugurated formally next week in Beijing and to begin extending loans by the spring, has been seen as one of the biggest challenges to the US-led global economic order since the establishment of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund at Bretton Woods in 1944.

With the appointment of Yang, who served as China’s board representative at the World Bank until 2013, the bank will be bringing in an executive with close links to the Chinese leadership and the AIIB at a crucial moment.

Both the World Bank and the AIIB have already pledged to work together and some of the AIIB’s first projects are expected to be co-financed by the Washington-based bank.

Levy’s arrival, meanwhile, comes as Brazil’s deepest recession in more than a century is becoming a source of growing anxiety at both the bank and the IMF.

But while the former banker is well respected in international financial circles it is unclear whether his appointment will be of benefit to the bank’s relationship with the government of President Dilma Rousseff, who has had an uneasy relationship with orthodox economics.

Levy, a fiscal hawk, resigned as finance minister in December after serving for less than a year when Brazil suffered its second ratings downgrade in months.

As infighting over a corruption scandal at state-controlled oil company Petrobras consumed Brazil’s Congress, Levy found himself increasingly isolated. A move to impeach Ms Rousseff only made his job harder as it forced the president to seek support among the far left of her Workers’ party, which is bitterly opposed to austerity measures.

Levy will replace Bertrand Badré, a former French banker, who is due to leave as chief financial officer later this year after overseeing a controversial reorganisation of the bank.

Besides his new role overseeing the bank’s vast bureaucracy, Yang will become China’s new top voice at the bank. That role was left empty by the departure of Jin-Yong Cai, a former Goldman Sachs banker who left as head of its private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation, at the end of December amid some controversy.

The World Bank’s press office declined to comment on the appointments. The Chinese embassy in Washington also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
