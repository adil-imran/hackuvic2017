Vermont city prepares for Syrian refugees with welcome, wariness

The Boston Globe ^ | May 13, 2016 | Brian MacQuarrie

Posted on by PROCON

RUTLAND, Vt.  Marble quarries known the world over once attracted immigrants to this small city tucked beside the Green Mountains. Now, a simple quest for peace and safety is beckoning a new group.

Mayor Christopher Louras has unveiled a plan, developed in near-secrecy, to resettle 100 Syrian refugees who fled the onslaught of the Islamic State and are exiled in sprawling Jordanian camps.

If approved by the State Department and others, the resettlement would begin in October and gradually send Rutland more Syrian refugees than are currently living anywhere else in New England.

The influx would be a jolt of instant cultural diversity for Rutland, where there are no mosques and no other Syrian immigrants. Most residents appear ready to welcome the refugees, mindful of the harrowing images of Syrians desperately seeking refuge outside their ravaged country.

{Mayor} Louras made no apologies for excluding the public from the planning. If the proposal had been floated earlier, the mayor said, the debate would have become about them  meaning the Syrians, their culture, and possible links to terrorism... The muslim invasion continues, brought to you exclusively by the democratic party.

Idiots. More welfare cases with islamic idiocy on top. There is no work for them in Rutland. Most will just become junkies and women haters.

Vermont is just the place for them.They can all learn to ski. I wonder how many of the refugees are young males? .

The morons who keep electing Bernie Sanders, about to get what they deserve.



To: PROCON

Why does anyone of questionable desirability have to come here? If these people are Muslim, why can’t they relocate to rich Muslim countries?

Rutland County voted over 60% for Zero and his Communist/Terrorist agenda. The city likely even higher. Ya get what ya pay fer.

“Very doubtful” I agree. They don’t welcome you if you are from RI.

“planning.

October? Genius! The height of leaf peeping season in Vermont. Nothing says don't ever come back to our area like terrorizing the tourists you depend on yearly with a bunch of scumbag islamic refugees.

Why does anyone of questionable desirability have to come here? If these people are Muslim, why cant they relocate to rich Muslim countries? The duty of a Muslim is to spread Islam worldwide.

That is hard to do if Muslims are over there and us Kafirs are here. Even if some Muslims don't want to get our Infidel blood on their hands, they help out Islam by providing cover and protection for those Muslims who want to kill us if we don't convert. Also as a solid voting block, Muslims can help undermine our naive country.-Tom

“”the resettlement would begin in October”” Well, winter could come early for them. An especially nasty, wicked winter!!

“”the mayor said, the debate would have become about them”” Gee - that guy is a genius! I thought for sure it would be about the Irish!

From the linked article:

“A big embrace would come from Rutland Regional Medical Center, where president Thomas Huebner said he has 120 job openings. Many of those jobs  including housekeepers, food-service workers, nurses, and technicians  might be a match for the Syrians, he said.” So what about the locals who need these jobs!!! No American citizens qualified? WTF??

Eventually to be replaced by a mayor named Achmed.

I haven’t read this many idiotic statements in one article in ages. Are these people for real? Doesn’t VT have laws regarding open meetings? How did they get away with this? It sounds as if the people who live there are stupid enough to keep that mayor in office. Brought in by “non profit resettlement agency” - Absolutely. Can’t get along without those non profits, can we? What a joke on the people of this country. There aren’t people in that town who could take those 120 jobs at a local hospital? Or are they all on welfare and not interested? Yeah - let’s bring in refugees because we have a population who isn’t interested in working. I have no idea if that is the case here but that is just ONE of the stupid remarks here. It really will make you want to barf...Guess that will be the last pig to get roasted in that town. If there are any pigs raised in the area, that will have to come to an end! “”I own it. I took the hits, and Ill continue to take the hits, Louras said recently at a downtown pig roast, where he helped dish out the pork to benefit a childrens museum.””

The mayor is fully responsible for the mayhem that will soon begin happening. The mayor brought the savages in, and bears full culpability for the forthcoming murders and rapes.

This Vermont town is full of people who can not read about what has happened in Europe. Poor souls.



To: PROCON

Ironically, I just read an article this morning about states with the highest and lowest violent crime rates. Vermont was number 1, the lowest crime rate. Well, it looks like thats not going to last now that the invaders are coming there. No more vacations in Vermont for us.

Anybody taking up a pool on a date that a citizen is raped or killed by a refugee in this town? If so I got dibs on May 30th because it’s a holiday.
