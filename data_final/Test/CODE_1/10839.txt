The Obama administration used its unofficial gag order on referring to Islamic terrorism as pretext to censor video of French President Francois Hollande.

Audio and video of Hollande speaking at the president’s final nuclear security summit on Friday were edited from a White House file to remove the term “Islamist terrorism,” media watchdog MRC reported. Only the official text remained on the WhiteHouse.gov page.

“We are also making sure that between Europe and the United States there can be a very high level coordination,” Hollande said while speaking at a Washington press conference. “But we’re also well aware that the roots of terrorism, Islamist terrorism, is in Syria and in Iraq. We therefore have to act both in Syria and in Iraq, and this is what we’re doing within the framework of the coalition. And we note that Daesh is losing ground thanks to the strikes we’ve been able to launch with the coalition.”

Audio of Hollande mentioning “Islamist terrorism” was the only portion of the video where edits were made.

“Once again I feel as if someone needs to tell high majesty the Obama that George Orwell wrote ‘1984’ as a warning … not an instruction manual,” an MRC reader named Joe commented.

“The Ministry of Truth has arrived in full force,” said another user in reference to Orwell’s novel.

Hollande is not shy about referring to Islamic terrorism in part because France has struggled with radicals for decades.

Middle East foreign policy expert Daniel Pipes, director of the Middle East Forum, has regularly covered the French government’s 751 Zones Urbaines Sensibles, or Sensitive Urban Zones, which the state does not fully control, WND reported Jan. 20, 2015.

The French zones were first identified by the government in 1996.

“These are not full-fledged no-go zones,” Pipes has explained, WND reported, “but, as the French nomenclature accurately indicates, ‘sensitive urban zones.’ In normal times, they are unthreatening, routine places. But they do unpredictably erupt, with car burnings, attacks on representatives of the state (including police), and riots.”

Fox News actually issued an on-air apology in January 2015 after Islam expert Steve Emerson spoke on the subject of no-go zones with host Jeanine Pirro.

“To be clear, there is no formal designation of these zones in either country and no credible information to support the assertion that there are specific areas in these countries that exclude individuals based solely on their religion,” said “Fox Report” host Julie Banderas on Jan. 17, 2015.

Robert Spencer, editor of Jihad Watch, told WND at that time that while Emerson did make some factual errors (which Emerson apologized for), the underlying premise about “sensitive urban zones” was sound.

France has also suffered two high-profile terrorist attacks in recent years.

Islamic terrorists responsible for the Jan. 7, 2015, massacre at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo killed 17 people over the course of three days.

Islamic terrorists killed 130 people across Paris on Nov. 13, 2015. They killed 89 individuals inside Bataclan theater alone.

French Minister Patrick Kanner said earlier this week that France has at least 100 neighborhoods that rival Molenbeek, Belgium, in terms of Islamic radicalism. Brussels’ Molenbeek was the planning hub for the city’s March 22 terror attack, which killed 35 people and wounded 340 others.

“We know that there are today around a hundred neighborhoods in France which have potential similarities to what has happened in Molenbeek,” Kanner said during a recent radio interview, the Daily Mail reported Monday.

European authorities are still hunting for eight individuals connected to November’s terror attack in Paris and this month’s massacre in Brussels, the newspaper reported.

Update:

The White House blamed “a technical issue with the audio during the recording” for the muted section of Hollande’s video late Friday.

MRC replied with following questions:

If the audio was, indeed, lost (for just that comment) during recording, how did they resurrect it?

If there were two versions of the video, why did they originally pull the glitch-free version, then post the one with the audio missing, in the first place?

In the version in which the translator’s audio is lost for the “Islamist terror” comment, why is Hollande speaking in French still audible – except for when he mouths the words, “Islamist terrorism”?

Why is audio of Hollande audible for the entire comment, except the words “Islamist terrorism”?

Why is the version of the video with the glitch still on the White House website, right next to the acknowledgement that it has an error?
