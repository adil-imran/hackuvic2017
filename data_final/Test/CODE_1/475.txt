A YOUNG girl in Pakistan has lashed out against the authors of a sickening note that had been slipped into her bedroom.

The girl, who has chosen to remain anonymous, said she was on the phone to a friend at around midnight when she heard someone knocking on her window.

She said that — despite the fact that she lives in a secure and enclosed apartment block — a group of young men managed to sneak up to her window and film her while she was getting changed.

They then pushed through a threatening note that appeared to blackmail her.

The note reads: “I have your nude vedio (sic) meet me outside now. You are wearing white penty (sic) and black bra holding an iPad”.

She said once she’d finished reading it, they demanded she go outside and “listen to what they had to say”.

When she said no, the men became more forceful, at which point the girl became furious and stormed outside the apartment with her father by her side.

Upon seeing both of them, the group ran away.

What’s just as disturbing are the responses she said she received from her community. She said people were making “polite jabs at her character”, asking questions like, “Why was her window open? Are you sure she’s not involved with one of the boys?”

On the public Facebook page Girls at Dhabas, she addressed the incident saying: “As if ANY of that matters when somebody took videos of me in MY ROOM, without MY consent and then had the audacity to try and blackmail me without ANY fear of consequence because they knew they could get away scot free and they have.

“Consent for females isn’t even a concept in this country and I am DONE with it. I am DONE. This is not the FIRST time I have been sextorted, nor am I the only woman going through it.

“So when you all whine about the extremists in our government, the rapists roaming free, the level of sexual and physical abuse women face in their homes, know that it doesn’t come from a VACUUM.

“The men doing these things are your sons, your brothers, your fathers and yourself. STOP ENABLING THIS TO HAPPEN TO THE WOMEN.”

She also said she only chose to remain anonymous at her father’s wish, because he was concerned for her safety.

Her remarks about Pakistan’s treatment of women are not untrue. Just last week, Pakistani journalist Marvi Sirmed hit back in a fury after she was threatened with rape on live television by a fellow panellist on a news program. She said he also tried to beat her.

Violence against women is an endemic social issue in the country, with wives and daughters often treated as domestic property.

Honour killings, acid attacks, bride burnings, child marriages, and sexual and domestic abuse are commonplace, yet these crimes are grossly under-reported.

The United Nation’s Gender Inequality Index puts Pakistan 147th in a list of 188 countries.

A 2014 report by the Aurat (Woman) Foundation, a women’s rights group based in Islamabad, said that every day of the year, six women were murdered, six were kidnapped, four were raped and three committed suicide.

They also reported as many as 7010 cases of violence against women in the province of Punjab. These figures do not include dowry-related violence and acid attacks; crimes which are also serious and frequent.

According to Pakistan’s independent Human Rights Commission, nearly 1100 women were killed in Pakistan last year by relatives who claimed they had ‘dishonoured’ their families.

In most of these cases, the victim is usually murdered by a close male family member.

In March this year, a landmark bill was enacted criminalising all forms of violence against women, which diehard extremists made several attempts to block.
