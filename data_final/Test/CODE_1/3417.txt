SIR: Just last week, three Nigerians were executed by firing squad for trafficking in drugs by the government of Indonesia. It brings back memories of “The Bar beach show”, a sad metaphor for the execution of condemned criminals by firing squad at the Lagos Bar Beach in the 1970s and 1980s. Then, condemned criminals who were either armed robbery or drug convicts were tied to the stake while the execution party made up of military marksmen took their positions to despatch the criminals to the great beyond.

There may have been hues and cries about the trial but the Nigerian government through the Ministry of External Affairs had ample opportunity of monitoring and observing the trial and where necessary initiate an appeal through their counsel. To rise in condemnation after the execution has been carried out is rather misplaced and misguided.

The truth is that unnecessary and needless death of one individual diminishes our humanity beside the fact that death penalty does not eliminate or reduce the crime for which the sentence was imposed. In China, one of the greatest civilizations, capital punishment is reserved for adulteration of food products, official corruptions etc. America still carries out death sentence in most of the states. The ultimate justification of any punishment is not that it is deterrent but that it is the emphatic denunciation by the community of a crime.

This brings me to the reaction by Nigerians to the execution. There was a pocket of protest by some aggrieved Nigerians at the Indonesian Embassy in Nigeria asking the Federal Government to issue strong statement in condemnation of the execution. My heart goes out to those Nigerians who came out to condemn the execution or killing. However, to the extent that the Indonesian government was exercising its sovereign power to uphold its laws and constitution, it would appear justified.

My worry is that the protest should rather be focused on what drives young Nigerians abroad to go and ply in all manners of unlawful merchandize and acts even against the law of the host nation. What we need to do as a people is to consciously mobilize and protest against despicable acts of looting our treasury and common patrimony by rogue political class who deny us of infrastructure and create an army of unemployed youths who eventually take to crime as a way out. Our leaders siphon our common wealth abroad to develop other lands leaving our own land famish, barren and in severe haemorrhage. We should protest against stupendous wages of the political office holders and other perquisites attach to their offices. We should protest the dearth of infrastructures that would have help us to be self-employed and be meaningfully engaged. We should protest and join the government in insisting that all those alleged to have used their office in breach of trust and enrich themselves should return the loot. We should protest against the brigandage of political office holders who use their offices for selfish personal gain and aggrandizement. We should protest and force our lawmakers to use their position to make good laws for the betterment of our country rather than employ ingenious language to defend what is obvious fraud like the semantics of budget padding where they want to corner resources they do not earn.

If we tackle the ills of our country no Nigerian citizen would go and live like a sub-human ape in any foreign land let alone engage in criminal act that would make his life to be cut short.

Nigeria is worth fighting for and with time it would be worth dying for if we all have a mental re-orientation and create a new value system. Our youths should stop these suicide missions abroad to escape from poverty imposed on us by inept and corrupt political leadership.
