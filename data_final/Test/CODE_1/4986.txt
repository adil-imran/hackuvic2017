India court orders shrine to lift ban on women

MUMBAI • A centuries-old Islamic mausoleum was ordered yesterday to allow women to enter its inner sanctum, after an Indian court said the ban violated their constitutional rights.

The Haji Ali Dargah trust has imposed the ban at the landmark mausoleum since 2012, insisting that allowing women near the tomb of a revered saint is "a grievous sin" in Islam.

The Bombay High Court ruled that women can enter the inner sanctum and that the state government has to ensure their security.

Hotels report orders to bar some nationalities

BEIJING • Police have ordered some low-end hotels in Guangzhou not to allow guests from five Muslim-majority countries to stay, although the foreign ministry said it had never heard of the policy.

Three hotels with rooms costing about 150 yuan (S$30) a night said they had received notices telling them to turn away people from Pakistan, Syria, Iraq, Turkey and Afghanistan.

All five nations have been beset by terrorist attacks or wars in the past few years.
