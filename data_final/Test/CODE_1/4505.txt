Our movie pick of the week is this hilarious comedy released on Thursday, October 6. Here's why we loved it and why you would too.

Genre

Comedy/Adventure/Drama

Plot

A 12-year old from the city, who is considered a problematic child, is assigned to new foster parents, Bella and Hec by child welfare services. The boy Ricky Baker is a pro at running away but the New Zealand bush plays the villain. He comes to love his new home, but the tide turns, and Ricky along with his foster father Hec become the targets of a nation-wide manhunt.

Cast

Julian Dennison plays the lead role of Ricky Baker while Sam Neill plays Uncle Hec - the grumpy foster father. Rima Te Wiata plays Aunt Bella. The hilarious, yet slighlty scary, child welfare service officer Paula is brought to life by Rachel House.

Director

The movie has been directed by Taika David Waititi and he has recieved critical acclaim and box-office success for this movie. He also acts in the movie, in the role of a minister at a funeral ceremony - which is one of the funniest scenes in the film. His upcoming movies include Thor (Ragnarok) and Moana.

Set and location

The movie is entirely set in New Zealand and more than 90 per cent of the movie was shot in the distinctive bush to make the adventure as realistic as possible to viewers.

Our favourite part

We have quite a few loved scenes from the movie, but the climax scene which includes car chases, car-drifts, gunfire and total chaos would have to be our favourite. It is funny, sentimental and action-packed, all rolled into one.

Notable mentions

Without giving out any spoilers, there are scenes with some pretty cool CGI effects. We also have to mention the annoyingly funny birthday song in the movie - the 'Ricky Baker' song, which according to Julian Dennison, has been voted as the most annoying birthday song ever in New Zealand.

No pigs or boars were harmed in the making of this movie - you'll get why we said that when you watch.

Ratings

It has a 98 per cent freshness rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
