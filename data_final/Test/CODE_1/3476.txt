THE mother of slain teacher Stephanie Scott says her “despicable” killer was able to break rules and do whatever he wanted while warning signs of his disturbing behaviour were ignored.

Merrilyn Scott told the Supreme Court at Griffith in NSW yesterday her daughter’s life was cut short by Vincent Stanford, a 25-year-old cleaner at Leeton High School who she branded as “pathetic” and “inept”.

Stanford’s sentencing hearing heard the killer’s own graphic account of how he murdered 26-year-old Ms Scott on Easter Sunday last year in a school storeroom.

She died from blunt force trauma to her head after he battered her with his fists, raped her and finally stabbed her in the neck.

Stanford told police “I think I went a little nuts” and that he was overwhelmed by the desire “to kill”.

Mrs Scott, standing just metres from Stanford, told the court in her victim impact statement how he “broke the rules” by working at six different schools and a TAFE and got away with it.

“Within less than a week, he had begun flouting rules, and was not challenged. There were many behaviours that should have raised red flags; his behaviour in the community was also anti-social at best,” she said.

Stanford was not supposed to have the alarm codes to the school, but within days he had obtained them and began switching the alarm off and on himself. According to the agreed statement of facts, he was seen at the school at times he wasn’t supposed to be there and in areas he didn’t need to be.

“He was seen in around the girls’ toilets during lunch breaks, including when the girls were in the toilets. There was an occasion when he was entering the girls’ toilet at a time he had no reason to be at the school,” the facts read.

His “arrogance” was so high he felt he could do whatever he pleased — even turning up at Leeton High that Easter weekend when he shouldn’t have been there, Mrs Scott said.

It put him on a collision course with Ms Scott, who was at school to prepare lessons for her English and drama students while she was away on her honeymoon.

A spokesman from the Department of Education said the department was not aware of the school ever having received a complaint about Stanford, nor any report of suspicious behaviour.

The company contracted to carry out cleaning the school has also denied anyone had raised any concerns about Stanford’s conduct.

‘JUST THAT I HAD TO KILL HER’

Stanford told police he hadn’t met Ms Scott before and didn’t know she was going to be at work on April 5, 2015.

In an interview with police, played to the court, he said a feeling came over him when he saw her working in the staffroom on a computer.

“Just that I had to kill her. I wasn’t angry or anything. Basically emotionless. Just that I had to kill her,” Stanford said.

He lay in wait for her and watched her start to leave. As she walked past him, Ms Scott said she was leaving and wished him a happy Easter.

Stanford grabbed her from behind, one arm around her waist and a hand over her mouth. He dragged her backwards into the storeroom.

In the police interview, Stanford tells a detective: “I think I went a little nuts.

“I just could not stop myself. I have had anger attacks in the past; I have been treated for that. I think I needed to see a psychiatrist.”

When asked how he killed Ms Scott, he calmly told them: “I did it at the high school. I beat her to death.”

In total, he struck her 30 or 40 times. He then raped her.

Stanford only stopped punching her when she stopped moving. He then stabbed her in the neck, deliberately striking her carotid artery to make sure she was dead.

There was so much blood he had to clean it away with a high-pressure hose. Stanford later dumped her body at the Cocoparra National Park, 70km away, where he poured 20 litres of petrol and set her on fire.

Mrs Scott told how she was haunted by what occurred at the school.

“It sickens me to think the last few moments on Earth Stephanie would have been at a loss to comprehend how this person, to whom she had only ever been polite and pleasant, could betray her so badly,” she told the court yesterday.

Mrs Scott was haunted by Stephanie’s desperate struggle to survive.

“Did she see the knife? Did she know her fate? Did she see his fist before he pounded her precious life into oblivion? And even as her life drained away, his assault continued,” she said.

The only thing they could be certain of was that she suffered.

ALONE ON HER WEDDING DAY

Instead of spending her wedding day with her new husband Aaron, surrounded by their friends and family, Stephanie Scott was alone in a cold morgue.

The 26-year-old, who Mrs Scott remembered was at the “height of her happiness and loveliness”, was in Griffith morgue awaiting the “long and lonely” road to the coroner for a post-mortem.

“Her ordeal was coming to a close,” Mrs Scott told the Supreme Court at Griffith yesterday.

If Stephanie’s ordeal was over, her family were now headfirst into their own.

“Ours was just beginning,” Mrs Scott said.

She finally came back to the family on April 21. Her body had been burned so badly parts of it no longer existed. Mrs Scott acknowledge the horror of it when she said simply: “The body bag could not be opened. This was another cruelty we had to endure.”

Mrs Scott spoke proudly of the daughter she would have given her own life for, telling those in court — including her killer — she was quick-witted, insightful, gentle, an inspiration, kind and generous, “truly one of the special ones”.

“She represented all that was good about humankind,” she said.

But for Stanford, she had nothing but contempt. He avoided her gaze throughout the hearing and kept his head down, and body slightly turned away from the public gallery that was packed with family and friends of Ms Scott.

“Too pathetic and inept to make a life of his own, he chose to take a life he had no right to,” Mrs Scott said.

At the time of the murder Mrs Scott said she would have gladly died, her grief was so intense.

“Stephanie is with me from my first conscious thought of a morning until I whisper ‘goodnight my darling girl’ in the darkness of my bed,” she said.

But then the nightmares begin.

“The nights are haunted by visions so terrible.”

VILE ONLINE SEARCHES

The facts also revealed the chilling and obscene internet searches Stanford did in the weeks before the murder.

He searched for violent assaults including “bride rape” and “bride kidnapping” weeks before he attacked Stephanie Scott. Stanford began the online searches for the vile content months before he raped and killed Ms Scott, but the majority of “bride” searches occurred while he was working casually at Leeton High School.

“The search histories from the offender’s phone and computer reveal the offender very regularly searched in relation to violent rape, violent sex, hardcore porn, and murder,” the agreed statement of facts states.

“He also conducts searches in relation to necrophilia and ‘necro rape’.”

The day before the murder, he bought a knife and handcuffs, and attempted to buy leg-cuffs. The items were intercepted by police after he had been arrested for Ms Scott’s murder.

‘COLD-BLOODED, MERCILESS KILLING’

Crown prosecutor Lee Carr told Justice Robert Allan Hulme a psychological report revealed Stanford first thought of killing someone when he was seven or eight years old.

A few years later he assaulted a teacher in The Netherlands.

Mr Carr argued the case fell “squarely” within the law that allowed for the most extreme murder cases to get a life sentence.

He said the expert report detailed how Stanford once said he didn’t believe he was capable of any other emotion than hatred.

“This was a cold-blooded, merciless, sexually motivated killing,” Mr Carr said.

Stanford’s barrister Janet Manuell SC asked Justice Hulme not to give him a life sentence, and urged him to consider his guilty plea, lack of convictions and his diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder as a child.

She conceded there was “no evidence of remorse”, however said the guilty plea was an acknowledgment by Stanford to the court and community he knew the crimes he’d committed were wrong.

Justice Hulme is expected to sentence Stanford on Thursday.
