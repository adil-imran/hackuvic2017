Bathinda: Catching the police unawares, more than 2,000 farm activists succeeded in reaching Rai Ke village near Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal's native Badal village on Tuesday midnight. Twelve farmer and labour organizations have given a call for three-day protest at Badal from January 22.Sensing heavy police deployment, farmers preferred to reach the village nearest to Badal two days in advance. Surprised by the farmer outfits' move, Bathinda police deployed hundreds of policemen in the wee hours in and around Rai Ke and restricted protesters to the village gurdwara.Police sealed all entry points to the village and did not allow anyone come in. Farmers alleged that the police even stopped people bringing food for them and raids were conducted at many places in Bathinda, Mansa and Barnala districts to dissuade more peasants from joining the protest.Bathinda deputy commissioner and senior superintendent of police reached Rai Ke and stayed there for many hours. Two rounds of talks by police and district administration with the protesting farmers remained inconclusive.Farmers are protesting to seek Rs 40,000 per acre compensation for cotton growers whose crop was damaged due to whitefly and Rs 20,000 per farm workers' family who were deprived of their livelihood due to pest attack. They are also asking government to make efforts to stop farm suicides and give a compensation of Rs 5 lakh to each suicide hit family along with writing-off of the entire institutional and non-institutional debt against farmers."We have assembled at Rai Ke village near Badal and plan to hold a protest from January 22 to 24. However, hundreds of policemen have been deployed here turning the village into cantonment to scare us, and now police are not allowing us to carry out the march. It is like undeclared emergency," alleged Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri and Punjab Khet Mazdoor Union secretary Lachhman Singh Sewewala.When contacted, Bathinda SSP Swapan Sharma said, "The village gurdwara committee contacted me that hundreds of farmers had forcibly entered worship place and wanted to stay here. Many of Rai Ke residents have also complained that farmers might create law and order problem. The protesting farmers have no permission to assemble in such a manner and police will not allow them to take law in their hands."He said police force from three districts had been called to maintain law and order and raids were being conducted to detain farmers in the neighbouring districts.
