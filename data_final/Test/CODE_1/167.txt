New Delhi, Oct 11: Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered a strong anti-terror message during his address at the Dussehra Mahotsav rally in Lucknow. Modi attacked Pakistan in a veiled manner, saying that action should also be taken against the ‘supporters of terror’. Describing terrorism as the enemy of humanity, Modi said that is imperative upon the 125 crore Indians to tackle the threat of terrorism. The Prime Minister urged people to recall the valour exhibited by Ramayana character Jatayu, who unsuccessfully attempted to battle Ravana at the time the demon was abducting Sita.

Hitting out specifically at Pakistan, Modi said, “Those who shield terrorists cannot be spared”. In what appeared to be another veiled warning to Pakistan, Modi added, “As the Ramayana bears testimony, war is sometimes necessary.” The remarks of Indian Prime Minister struck with the crowd who received the message with huge applause. Chants of Jai Shri Ram erupted at the Aishbagh in Lucknow, where the Dussehra Mahotsav was being held.

Modi expressed sorrow over the condition of children and civilians in Syria. “Tears get filled in my eye when I watch the condition of Syrian children. This terrorism has no boundaries. No nation is safe. The world needs to unite and fight against this evil,” Modi said. He recalled an incident of 1992, when a United States diplomat shunned off his suggestion that world needs to take a tough stance against terrorism. “In 1992-93, I was talking to someone from US Department of State on terrorism. They said it is your ‘law and order’ problem. That changed after 26/11,” Modi added. (ALSO READ: Did PM Narendra Modi celebrate Diwali in Kashmir for votes: BJP asks opposition)

Apart from speaking on the issue of terrorism, Prime Minister Modi also stressed on the eradication of other manifestation of Ravana from the society. “Filth, poverty, corruption and illiteracy are another form of Ravana, so let’s burn them as well this year. Everyone should take the resolve of eradicating the Ravana from himself, and from all spheres of the society.”

“Whether if is Hindus or Muslims or any other community, we should the end the evil of gender discrimination. Girl child should not be considered as inferior,” Modi said, informing the audience that the world is also celebrating International Girl Child Day, along with Vijayadashami.

Unlike what political analysts expected, Modi did not make any remarks against political opponents like Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal who had accused the Prime Minister of politicising the surgical strikes carried out by Indian army in retaliation to the Uri terror attack.
