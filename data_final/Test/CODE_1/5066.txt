MANILA, Philippines - Barangay officials involved in illegal drugs are “high-value targets,” according to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA).

“More and more barangay officials are getting involved in the illegal drug trade in the last three years. They are considered high-value drug personalities,” Derrick Carreon, PDEA spokesperson, said.

Scores of village chiefs suspected as drug pushers were either slain in police operations or by suspected vigilantes across the country since President Duterte launched an all-out war against illegal drugs.

PDEA records show that six village chiefs and 59 councilors were arrested for drug-related offenses in 2015. The figure is 20 percent higher compared to 2014.

Scores of barangay chairmen and other village officials have been arrested for violation of Republic Act 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act since January.

PDEA chief Isidro Lapeña had said the number of barangay officials involved in illegal drugs is ”alarming.”

”It is a shame. They are the highest elected officials in their communities, but they are the ones pushing illegal drugs instead of taking care of the welfare of their constituents,” Lapeña said.

The President earlier said a majority of 8,000 government officials on the third narco list that he would release soon are barangay captains.

Duterte said narco-politics was the main reason why he wanted the barangay elections postponed. He warned the public that only candidates with money would win the polls.

Drug suspect slain

Meanwhile, in Camarines Sur, farmer Jerry Amit, 35, was found dead in a grassy area in Sitio Bocol, Barangay Calagbangan in Sipocot town on Friday night. A 36-inch bolo was recovered at the scene.

Police said the fatality was a known drug suspect in his barangay.

Senior Inspector Malou Calubaquib, Bicol police spokesperson, said 62 other suspected drug pushers have been killed in shootouts with police since July.

P4.67-M shabu seized

In Agusan del Sur, 39.5 grams of shabu with an estimated street value of P4.67 million were seized in simultaneous raids on Barangay Consuelo in Bunawan town at around 7:20 a.m. yesterday.

Police said it was the biggest haul of illegal drugs in the Caraga region.

Saada Macasalong, 23, and Amil Sultan, whom police said are on their drug watchlist, were arrested.

In Albay, Anthony Tejero, 26, was nabbed during a police operation in Barangay Quirangay in Camalig, Albay at around 12:55 a.m. on Friday.

Senior Inspector Arthur Gomez, Albay police information officer, said the suspect yielded four sachets of shabu and P500 in cash. – Artemio Dumlao, Francis Elevado, Ben Serrano, Celso Amo
