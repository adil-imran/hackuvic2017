T-minus $$$ to moonshot

T MINUS $$$ TO MOONSHOT LAUNCH — Vice President Joe Biden unveils his plan for the cancer moonshot this afternoon after months of government-wide and private sector deliberations on how best to accelerate its progress. It will include policy recommendations from the Moonshot Task Force for a range of government agencies — possibly for funding for the genome sequencing of tumors — and Biden’s vision for how to achieve 10 years of advancements against cancer in half that time.

This is likely the Obama administration’s last big White House event on the issue. It follows a blue ribbon report last month that laid out the greatest scientific opportunities in cancer research. But whether the Moonshot lifts off or fails to launch depends largely on whether Congress funds it in the upcoming lame-duck session.

Appropriators have shown they’re willing to boost NIH’s fortunes based on bills passed in committee earlier this year, but cancer research advocates will be pushing for extra short-term funding in the 21st Century Cures legislation.

The “Cures bill is something we are going to be strongly advocating for in the lame duck because it’s the perfect vehicle for the moonshot,” said Jon Retzlaff, managing director of science policy and government relations at the American Association for Cancer Research. “[It] could really change the face of cancer.”

Happy Monday and welcome to Prescription PULSE, where we note that this month in 1979, Allan Cormack and Godfrey Hounsfield won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for their work developing computer-assisted tomography — the revolutionary new 3-D imaging technology.

FDA TO COLLECT $2.5 BILLION IN USER FEES IN GDUFA II — That’s nearly $1 billion more than the agency agreed to collect in the first iteration of the Generic Drug User Fee Act, which was signed into law in 2012. Generic drug companies and FDA agreed that user fees should total $493.6 million annually in GDUFA II, which Congress is expected to reauthorize in late 2017. It would run through FY 2022. In GDUFA I they agreed to $299 million a year, but that was based on FDA receiving about 750 generic drug applications each year. Instead, the agency has received about 1,000 applications annually, so the agency needs additional funds to meet its productivity goals. The GDUFA II fee structure is also being revised so that FDA receives a smaller percentage of its user fees from new generic drug applications. To offset this change, companies that sponsor one or more approved generic drugs will pay an annual fee. The agency is also eliminating fees for supplements to already approved applications and altering how it determines fees for small companies.

The full text of the commitments FDA agreed to in return for the financial support was also released late last week. Some highlights: FDA is committing to review 90 percent of generic applications within 10 months of submission. It will review priority applications within eight months if a company submits certain manufacturing information two months ahead of filing its application.

UDI TO FLY — The obscure ASC-X12 standards committee will likely recommend that unique device identification numbers for medical devices be included on payment claims forms, Pro eHealth’s Darius Tahir reports. Even as the device industry’s trade groups have publicly turned against the idea, objections from stakeholders, including the American Hospital Association and even CMS, have gradually been worn down by safety hawks and data wonks campaigning to do for medical devices what the barcode did for retail products.

… UDI would allow tracking of individual devices as they move through the system, enabling easier recalls and informing comparative effectiveness research. AdvaMed worries that information on the claims forms will lead to research that misconstrues the data, and instead recommends putting the UDI on electronic health records. But members of the standards committee said the concerns would be overcome. “Right now I am optimistic that there will be a field for the device identifier on the claim,” Joseph Drozda, Mercy Hospital cardiologist and X-12 workgroup member, told Darius. “There’s a groundswell to support that.”

TOP DEMS PRESSURED FDA, DRUG COMPANY TO HELP DYING BIG DONOR — Former President Bill Clinton, then-Sen. John Kerry and other top Democrats pressured FDA and a pharmaceutical company to get a top donor access to an experimental cancer medicine, according to hacked emails released by Wikileaks Saturday. In 2008, Clinton and Kerry, along with former Sens. Max Baucus and Tom Harkin, worked Washington lobbyists, board members and shareholders for the drug company Biogen, helping to arrange conversations between then-FDA Commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach and company CEO James Mullen. They were working to get Dallas fundraiser Fred Baron access to Biogen’s Tysabri to treat his bone marrow cancer.

The effort appeared to help persuade FDA to provide assurances to the drug company that FDA would turn a blind eye to any negative effects experienced by Baron when evaluating the drug, but Biogen continued to say no. Doctors are legally allowed to use FDA approved treatments "off label" for conditions not approved by FDA. However, Tysabri’s distribution was very tightly controlled and monitored because it increases patients risk of a deadly brain infection. Ultimately it was Nancy Pelosi — who worked with FDA and the Mayo Clinic to get the drug administered without the company’s consent, according to the Dallas Morning News. But it did not save Baron’s life.

The disclosure comes amid a nationwide push for “Right-to-Try” laws that allow terminally ill patients to skirt FDA’s compassionate use process when requesting access to experimental medicines. More than half the states have passed such laws with huge bipartisan support, but backers haven't been able to get a national version though the Senate. Former FDA attorney Patti Zettler said that the Wikileaks emails actually support the position that "FDA generally works with terminally and seriously ill patients who are seeking expanded access." That, she added, suggests that the right to try laws are a "misplaced policy effort to the extent they draw attention and resources away from efforts to develop effective treatments for terminally and seriously ill patients, sow confusion about the FDA’s role and processes or create false hope.” And despite the emails' claim that Biogen hesitated in Baron's case over fears it could compromise the drug's approval for cancer, Zettler added that FDA has recently published a study showing it is extremely rare for adverse events from expanded access to have a negative impact on drug development.

MED DEVICE INDUSTRY CHAMPION IN TOUGH REELECTION FIGHT — Rep. Erik Paulsen last year helped win a two-year moratorium on Obamacare's medical device tax, but the Minnesota Republican is facing his toughest reelection contest. Paulsen represents exactly the type of wealthy, suburban swing district where Donald Trump's incendiary rhetoric may prove toxic down ballot. He’s won his last three reelection contests by more than 15 points, but polls show his district is distinctly anti-Trump. More from Pro’s Paul Demko here.

PHARMA IN THE STATES

A PEEK BEHIND THE DRUG REBATE CURTAIN DOESN’T MAKE THE PICTURE ANY PRETTIER — Drug spending in Massachusetts grew significantly from 2013 to 2015, the state’s Office of the Attorney General reported last week, even when accounting for discounts and rebates paid by drug companies. The findings debunk claims that rebates — often kept secret — mitigate the trend of increased drug spending when only the list price is taken into account. The AG studied spending by 10 different plans accounting for about 75 percent of Massachusetts’ commercial market and found that in most cases rebates didn’t substantially alter the increase in spending. In one case, a health plan actually experienced a greater increase in drug spend post-rebates.

… Competition fail. The AG also conducted a case study of multiple sclerosis drugs to understand why prices have increased even as new drugs have entered the market. There are 14 FDA approved products). The report found net prices, not just list prices, have been steadily increasing since 2011. It also found that most commercial plans in the state pay very similar prices for the treatments despite different negotiation approaches with drug companies, varying plan size and market share, and differences in formulary design.

“Our findings suggest we cannot count on competition … to discipline prices” because the demand for treatments for some diseases is great enough that “payers cannot meaningfully negotiate on formulary placement or the rebates that lower net prices.” Another problem, they said, is the lack of data on comparative effectiveness. Most MS drugs haven’t been tested in head-to-head clinical trials, making it difficult to assess whether one is more valuable than another.

… Generic competition suffers too. Of the 10 MS drugs they zeroed in on, the only drug with a generic alternative in the group, Copaxone 20 mg, appears to have become victim to “product hopping” — a tactic used by brand drug makers to squash generic competition. A year before the generic drug came on the market, Teva introduced an injectable version that patients take less often. By the time the generic Copaxone 20 mg pill was available, 70 percent of patients had changed to the newer branded version, which doesn’t have an automatically substitutable generic.

TEXAS JUDGES LET CONTROVERSIAL DOC OFF THE HOOK — Most of the serious accusations against Stanley Burzynski, a Texas doctor who has been under suspicion by federal and state regulators of giving cancer patients unproven treatments for decades, were dismissed by a panel of state judges last week. One of the judges went as far as to describe Burzynski as “‘a dedicated and innovative physician’ whose treatments have saved the lives of cancer patients, both adults and children,’” the Houston Chronicle reports. The state’s case against Burzynski focused on seven patients who said they were lured by false advertising about his controversial and unproven chemotherapy and received substandard care. It’s the latest victory for Burzynski who’s been targeted by FDA and the Texas State Medical Board. Terminal patients travel all over the world to see the doctor, although his medications have never been proven effective in clinical trials.

CALIFORNIA FIGHT OVER PROP 61 HEATS UP — Sen. Bernie Sanders headlined a rally Friday for the ballot measure that would cap what state programs pays for prescription drugs at the rates negotiated by the Veteran’s Administration. The provision has enjoyed broad approval in recent polls, but six more California papers weighed in last week against the measure, joining a recent wave of editorials warning that it’s not the answer to high drug prices.

MERCK, AETNA SET UP DIABETES PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE PROGRAM — The drug giant and health insurer announced the latest agreement that aims to tie drug reimbursement to how well products work in the real world. Merck will provide Aetna with rebates on two of its type 2 diabetes drugs, Januvia (sitagliptin) and Janumet (sitagliptin plus metformin). Rebates will be based, in part, on whether Aetna’s members achieve or maintain their treatment objectives while taking the medications. Merck will also work with Aetna on its AetnaCare initiative. The program works with patients, physicians and caregivers to encourage treatment adherence, reinforce healthy behaviors and provide additional support, such as nutrition assistance. These types of reimbursement deals have been touted as one of the promising non-government solutions to high drug prices, but industry experts say it will probably be a year or two before we’ll learn if any of these programs live up to their promise.

QUICK HITS

Staving off an IPR challenge. Biopharmaceutical firm, Shire, proved victorious over hedge fund manager Kyle Bass this month, staving off an IPR challenge — a method of contesting a company’s intellectual property more quickly than through the court system. The Patent and Trademark Office upheld the validity of one of the company’s patents, which is related to the ulcerative colitis drug, Lialda.

Free charity? Forbes reports Doctors Without Borders rejected $1 million worth of free pneumonia vaccines from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, arguing that there is no such thing as “free” vaccines. The organization’s executive director, Jason Cone, writes in a Medium blog post that such acts of charity often come with conditions restricting where the vaccines can be administered and who can receive them. Pfizer strongly disagreed.

Secret compassion. Only about one in five drug and biotech companies post on their websites their “compassionate use” policies, which allow for the use of investigational medical products outside of clinical trials. That’s according to a recent review by Avalere.

Fighting superbugs. As the FDA ramps up the fight to control deadly superbugs by limiting antibiotic use in American livestock, the pharmaceutical industry — while complying with policy — is marketing the same drugs to veterinarians and expanding sales overseas to offset any decline in U.S. sales. More from Bloomberg.

Rx legislation. Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn) introduced the Prescription Drug and Medical Device Review Board Act last week. It would create a board to review the prices of drugs and medical devices, as well as manufacturing costs. The board would be empowered to take actions such as limiting the period during which monopolies are protected or imposing fines on companies charging excessive prices.

CBO fuzzy math? American Enterprise Institute's Joe Antos questions how the CBO concluded the Medicare Part B drug payment demonstration project would save $1.1 billion over a decade, given how few specifics are known about how the program would work. Read his paper here.

Cases dismissed. A federal judge in Massachusetts dismissed the cases against two employees of the New England Compounding Center whose handling of contaminated steroids led to a nationwide outbreak of fungal meningitis, the FDA Law Blog reports. Other NECC cases are ongoing, but the judge concluded that these two employees, who were responsible for checking outgoing drug packages for accuracy, were not pharmacists dispensing prescriptions under the law, and therefore, had no intent to defraud or mislead.

Making pigs safe again. The FDA is working to bolster the regulation of heparin in China to prevent another tragedy like the one that took place in 2007-08. More than 80 deaths in the U.S. resulted from an adulterated version. But heparin's complex mixture of molecules makes it difficult for regulators to determine its authenticity. One Chinese company, Enoray, however, is up for the challenge of guaranteeing the integrity of its heparin supply chain. More from C & EN.

Weapon for sale. An Associated Press investigation found 12 Chinese companies will export a powerful synthetic opioid known as carfentanil to the United States and other countries, for as little as $2,750 a kilogram, no questions asked. It’s a powerful chemical that has been killing unsuspecting drug users and is so lethal that it presents a potential terrorism threat. Officials say the drug, which is manufactured legally and openly sold online in China, is comparable to traditional nerve agents, raising concerns that they can be used as chemical weapons.

THE COST OF VACCINE PREVENTABLE DISEASE — Researchers estimate that adults in the U.S. who didn’t receive 10 recommended vaccines were responsible for about $7.1 billion in avoidable costs from doctors visits, hospitalizations and lost productivity. One example from the new Health Affairs paper: Just 42 percent of adults received the flu vaccine in the last flu season; influenza accounted for $5.79 billion in medical costs. More here.

GENERIC DRUG MAKERS ACCUSED OF COLLUDING ON PRICE HIKES — Perrigo Company, Fougera Pharmaceuticals, Sandoz and Taro Pharmaceutical Industries are all accused of conspiring to raise and fix the price of the generic skin treatment, Desonide, in a class-action lawsuit filed last week by an employee health fund in the Southern District of New York. Shortly after two meetings attended by each of the companies in July 2013, the drug makers acted in concert to raise the price of generic Desonide, with some versions rising by as much as 800 percent.

CATCHING OUR ATTENTION: GENERATION ADDERALL — Adderall, the drug prescribed to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder, has become ubiquitous on college campuses, with sales exploding among adults to the tune of roughly 16 million prescriptions in 2013. But not much is known about the long-term effects of using the drug. Casey Schwartz, author of “In the Mind Fields,” shares her journey of how she broke free. The New York Times magazine.
