Blood In The Land Agatu after its destruction by herdsmen. Bloody rampage by herdsmen across Nigeria and other acts of violence turn Nigeria into one huge blood pool

By Chidiebere Onyemaizu

When the Inspector-General of Police, Solomon Arase, in the wake of the mindless destruction of Agatu and its people mid February, declared that AK-47 wielding, blood-baying Fulani herdsmen who have inflicted untold destruction on lives and properties on their host communities across Southern Nigeria and North central geopolitical zone, were actually not Nigerians but illegal Fulani alliens from neigbhouring countries, Nigerians, especially victims of their chilling mayhem, were mouth agape and waited for these reassuring words from the Nigerian government and the police chief: ‘the police and other security agencies will however, collaborate to flush them out’.

But the words never came.Rather, what came out was government’s plan to import grasses from Brazil to build ranches for the marauding herdsmen. During stakeholders’ meeting convened by Arase to unravel the Agatu tragedy, leader of the herdsmen in the area, Ardo Boderi said they unleashed mayhem on their host community because over 10,000 of their cows were killed by Agatu people. Question: Why didn’t the police arrest Boderi there and then as either one of the perpetrators of the heinous murders in Agatu or accessory to the crime? Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode lamented the kid glove treatment the Agatu killers received saying: “After the meeting, instead of being arrested for genocide and ethnic cleansing there and then, they were allowed to go home quietly. Not even their AK-47s were confiscated from them.”

Now, whether the herdsmen are Nigerians or not, salient questions which the Nigerian government will now address are: Is there any law in Nigeria permitting herdsmen to carry arms? If they are foreign mercenaries, why did security forces look the other way while they invaded the country with their animals and guns? And are the gun-wielding,violence thirsty herdsmen, whether Nigerians or mercenaries, above the Nigerian law, untouchable and more powerful than the police and other security forces?

Where are the suspected armed Fulani herdsmen who opened fired on the then Benue state governor, Gabriel Suswam in 2014? Why were they not arrested and tried? Where are the suspected Fulani herdsmen that penultimate Friday unleashed gun attack on the convoy of the immediate past Senate President, David Mark while on assessment tour of Agatu? Do they have licence to maim and kill, and thereafter roam the communities free men?

Why has no herdsmen been arrested, charged and tried for murder, rape and destruction of economic farmlands having often commit such crimes in many states of the federation where they graze their cattle armed with Ak-47? Why does the Nigerian law grow impotent and cold when it comes to the activities of the herdsmen?

A competent source in Kano, the Kano state capital suggested that many herdsmen roaming about communities in some parts of the country and causing mayhem are not actually owners of the herd of cattle they shepherd. He told the magazine that many of the herdsmen work for highly placed and influential Emirs, retired and serving Generals, politicians and businessmen in the North. “They are the ones who own most of the cattle. The herdsmen you see everywhere are simply working for them,” he told The Source. He also revealed that, that is why it has been practically difficult to bring gun-wielding herdsmen to book or account for their misdeeds. The source who also owns herds of cattle would not however say whether or not these high personalities are also behind arming some of the herdsmen with AK-47.

The above substantially tallies with the reports of entitled “Terror in the Food Basket,” published not too long ago by SMB Intelligence, a data mining and research firm that provides analysis of Nigeria’s socio-political and economic situation. Part of the report reads: “There are a lot more herdsmen today that there were in previous years, and it appears there are some accompanying them who are not practising the normal business of herding. There are allegation that some of the owners of the cattle are retired Army Generals and politicians — it is a big business”.

The herdsmen’s menace, gruesome cult-related killings in Rivers state, deaths arising from the Shittes-Army clash, massacre of defenceless, unarmed Independent People of Biafra, IPOB protesters by security forces in the Southeast and communal clashes in parts of the country underline how cheap life has become in Nigeria and how the country has been turned to an occean of blood. In the Agatu violence, hundreds of indigenes reportedly lost their lives to the invading herdsmen. Attacks by herdsmen have also left trails of blood in Enugu, Anambra, Ondo, Taraba, Nasarawa, Plateau, Delta, Oyo, Ekiti among other states. Many in the affected states actually believe that what was afoot was a sinister agenda, a jihad to take over their communities and possibly plant Islam.

This perception was early this month further reinforced by the violent confrontation between Yoruba and Hausa/Fulani in Agiliti area of Lagos in which the latter reportedly unleashed massive bloody violence on their Yoruba host, leaving many dead and properties destroyed.

Akpa Iduh, a community leader who spoke for the Agatus of the Idoma nation during the stakeholders’ meeting with Arase hit the nail on the head when he emphatically alleged that Fulanis were committed to taking over Agatu land and had therefore resorted to recruiting mercenaries to wipe out his people.

Though unconfirmed, reports have it that having succeeded in destroying Agatu land and sending its people away to become Internally Displaced Persons in refugee camps across Benue state, the herdsmen, apart from occupying the town, also let over 5,000 of their cows loose over Agatu.

The takeover theory is equally reinforced by the Conference of Autonomous Ethnic Communities Development Associations, CONAECDA. The group believes that the Agatu attacks and massacre of its people by Fulani herdsmen was a ploy to take over the minority Middle Belt. Suleiman Sukukum, CONAECDA Secretary-General said: ‘We are disturbed that the federal government is continuing in denial of the Fulani bandits. These bandits are largely sponsored to achieve specific objectives; obvious among which is the elimination of the local population and occupation of their lands’

The alleged Islamic agenda angle to the Fulani hersdmen menace is also believed in some quarters to be traceable to the Boko Haram insurgency in the Northeast. Some in the minority areas in the region believe that the insurgency is actually targeted at them with the aim of obliterating them from the face of the earth and occupying their lands.They claim that most of the insurgency worst-hit areas are Christian minority areas in the Northeast.

It is however, the opinion of many Northerners, especially Muslims that the region and their religion are unnecessarily being given negative profiling by Southerners, aided actively by some Southern press. In his weekly column in the Nation Newspaper,People and Politics, Mohammed Haruna, commenting on the Ese Oruru abduction saga recently lamented what he described as ‘a case of one standard for Muslims and another for non-Muslims. Haruna: ‘It is apparent that what we have here is a case of one standard for Muslims and another for non-Muslims… the biased framing of the Yunusa/Ese story by newspapers… is not only the worrisome aspect of it. Equally worrisome is the attempt by the newspapers to paint a pattern of Muslims abducting little Christian girls and forcing them into marriage…’

Others who hold similar view as Haruna are wondering why the orgy of blood letting in Rivers state where in less than two weeks, close to 30 people were murdered and many beheaded, not portrayed as Christian terrorism since the state is almost 100 percent dominated by Christians and both perpetrators and victims are Christians.

Questions are also being asked by some Northerners who have dismissed the alleged Muslim/Hausa-Fulani take over plot, as to why the bloody Ezzillo and Ezza-Ezillo (Ebonyi state), Umuode and Oruku (Enugu), Ilaje (Ondo), Itsekiri-Ijaw (Warri, Delta state) communal clashes among others that occurred not too long ago in the predominantly christian states were not also given religious colouration.

Equating intra-communal strife with invasion, from different part of the country, and destruction of hitherto serene and peaceful communities by armed individuals professing a different religion and culture according to Ifeanyi Elesiokwu, an APGA stalwart and public affairs commentator, is an unfair and wicked comparism: ‘communities can fight over land, traditional stools etc and few people may get killed but it’s an entirely different story when such communities are invaded and wiped out by arms-wielding herdsmen”, he said.

Ekiti state governor, Ayo Fayose, Prelate of the Methodist Church of Nigeria, Dr. Samuel Uche and Fani Kayode are among Nigerians who believe that the alleged Islamic take –over of Nigeria plot is real and on-going. Fayose: ‘I want to say one thing: They have started again. I want to reveal one secret here; they have started subtle moves to make Nigeria an Islamic nation. But God will not allow it. This was done in 1984 but it failed… Nigeria is a free nation and this nation will not be taken for Islamic nation’.

Fani Kayode: ‘I whole-heartedly concur with Fayose’s view that there are covert moves by some extremists that are in the corridors of power to quietly and secretly Islamise our country and they are attempting to do so with contempt and impunity. If anyone doubts that this is the case or believes it cannot happen, they should read the history of Turkey and find out how, what was once a Christian nation was eventually transformed into a full blown Muslim state’.

The Methodist Prelate last week spoke of “grand plan” by militant sect of the Fulani herdsmen with their Boko Haram collaborators to Islamise Nigeria. Dr. Uche told Vanguard Newspaper that: But I tell you, there is going to be serious resistance from Christians. We cannot fold our arms and watch these herdsmen continue killing our people like this.

Dr. Uche’s predecessor, Dr. Sunday Makinde, once lamented the free but brutal reign of the herdsmen this way: “the dangerous aspect of it is the sophisticated weapon that some of these Fulanis carry about. The question is, what is their motive of arming themselves against the innocent farmer whose crops are destroyed by their cows?”

President Muhammadu Buhari’s sudden volte-face to rail-road Nigeria to become a member of Islamic countries military coalition against terror has also heightened apprehension as to the alleged Islamic take-over of Nigeria and its gradual but steady islamisation. Less than two weeks after Buhari, through his spokesman, Shehu Garba, announced Nigeria’s refusal of Saudi Arabia’s invitation to join the Islamic forces coalition which it (Saudi Arabia) leads, the President penultimate week confirmed, during an interview with Arab satelite channel, Al Jazeera that Nigeria was indeed part of the coalition. Buhari to Al Jazeera: ‘yes we are part of it (Islamic coalition)… if there is an Islamic coalition to fight terrorism, Nigeria will be part of it because we are casualties of Islamic terrorism’.

When his interviewer sought to know whether Nigeria’s membership of the Saudi-led Islamic military coalition would not confer on Nigeria an Islamic identity since the country is evenly divide between muslims and Christians, Buhari took a swipe on Christians complaining of Nigeria’s membership of the coalition, saying ‘why can’t those Christians that complain go and fight terrorism in Nigeria and militancy in the South?”.

Buhari’s action has elicited a number of unanswered questions. For example, Elesiokwu wonders, if in the event of the Islamic forces coalition’s deployment to the Northeast to help Nigeria’s military forces fight Islamic terror group, Boko Haram, only Nigerian soldiers who are Muslims will be allowed in the frontline. And if Nigeria decides to contribute troops to fight terror in a member country, will such soldiers comprised of moslems only?

According to him, the implication of Nigeria’s membership of the coalition is that other members of the Islamic military coalition regard it (Nigeria) as an Islamic country. Elesiokwu: ‘Only Islamic countries are members of the military coalition and its clearly spelt out that it is a coalition of military forces of Islamic countries. Nigeria’s presence there therefore connotes that Nigeria is an Islamic country and some people see it that way. I suspect that, deep down the hearts of some Nigerian Muslims, Nigeria is an Islamic country’.

A section of Nigerians, especially in the South and minority areas in the North, who fear that the inelegant activities of Fulani herdsmen in their areas amount to subtle subjugation and eventual takeover and Islamisation of their communities point out that the Hausa/Fulani are not only unwilling to integrate into societies outside their own local environment where they live, but also quite often, exhibit territorial and expansionist tendencies. According to Austin Onoja, an educationist, ‘it is a habit peculiar to Hausa/Fulani to rename wherever they congregate, outside of their own locality, for transaction in cattle and other livestock, ‘Garki’, which in the Hausa language translates to ‘settlement’. Onoja cites Okigwe in Imo, Umuahia in Abia, Awkunanaw in Enugu, Benue, Abuja among other places where such ‘Garki enclaves exist.

A colunmist, Idowu Akinlotan in a January 4, 2009 article in the Nation newspaper held a similar view: ‘We must remember that analysts who seem to have queued behind settlers in the Jos crisis have ignored the salient fact that it was precisely the Hausa/Fulani of the North who at first kicked against oneness and sameness.”

As far as Elesiokwu is concerned, ‘Fulani herdsmen, whether they are Nigerians or from outside Nigeria, have turned communities in the South and Northcentral where they graze their animals to killing fields in furtherance of the late Umaru Dikko’s 2004 threat. Elesiokwu recalls that the late second Republic powerful Transport Minister, himself a Fulani, had, in an interview with Daily Sun, threatened that: ‘let everybody know now that if any tribe in Nigeria, and I make no limit, any tribe in Nigeria, thinks it can fight the Hausa/Fulani, it’s wasting its time because our tribe is not only in Nigeria, we extend right from Sudan, Cameroun, up to Gambia. If we blow our horns and call on our tribesmen, they will descend on Nigeria and take it over… we will call on our tribesmen across the world , they will descend on Nigeria and we will take over the whole country’.

According to Wikipedia, there are over 26 countries within the African continent where Fulanis can be found: Nigeria (15.3 million), Guinea (4.6 million), Senegal (3.2 million), Mali (2.5 million), Cameroon (2.5 million), Sudan (1.9 million), Burkina Faso (1.7 million), Niger (1.7 million), Mauritania (700,000), Benin Republic (450,000), Guinea Bissau (333,000), Gambia (320,000), Sierra Leone (310,000), Chad (285,000) and Central African Republic (265,000). Other African countries why there are millions of Fulanis, according to Wikipedia include Eritrea, Gabon, Togo, Ivory coast, Ghana, Liberia, Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, Libya among others.

It is in the light of the above that the proposed establishment of grazing reserves for herdsmen in every state of the federation is currently receiving knocks in some quarters. To some, setting up grazing reserves for herdsmen amount to compensating them for their murderous campaigns. The youth wing of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), views it from this prism. The body’s National president, Katse Daniel said recently: ‘it’s the Fulani hersdmen who are responsible for the killings and and the federal government is thinking of taking our land to give these people.This amount to a kind of suspicion that something is happening’.

Onoja’s worry is that with the disclosure that Boko Haram insurgents are now allegedly masquerading as herdsmen to infiltrate communities outside the volatile Northeast, including communities in the South of the country, to unleash mayhem, creating grazing reserves for herdsmen across the country inevitably amounts to creating a leeway to, in his words, for ‘agents of islamisation of Nigeria to have their way effortlessly’. According to him, ‘for example when you create grazing reserves for the herdsmen in the predominantly christian states, the herdsmen will immediately regard the vicinity of the reserves as their enclaves, choose a Seriki (leader) and in the long run agitate for an Emir for the enclave and introduction of Sharia. Imagine the chaos and bloodletting that could accompany herdsmen’s agitation, for example, for the installation of Emir of Enugu, Umuahia Okigwe or Makurdi.”

Describing violent Fulani herdsmen as Boko Haram insurgents, Senate Deputy Minority Leader representing Taraba South, Emmanuel Bwacha, last week, on the floor of the Senate lamented their activities in Taraba where he said they have so far killed over 2,000 people. Senator Bwacha: ‘there is a change of tactics by these insurgents who now parade as herdsmen to make it more difficult for the unsuspecting public to identify them’.

The distraught Senator further lamented: ‘they go about grazing with AK-47 riffles. The insurgents caught with over 300 cows in Borno state by the JTF lend credence to the assertion… these Boko Haram attackers, masquerading as Fulani herdsmen have killed over 2,000 people from December 2013 to date in the state’.

Still smarting from the bloodbath in Agatu where indigenes say over 300 people were allegedly killed by the herdsmen, another Benue community, Logo last week also laid prostrate to the herdsmen attacks which reports say left many dead and properties burnt. However, the police during the week claimed only one person died in the Logo crisis.

The Opiatoha K’ Idoma, an Idoma socio-cultural organisation recently rued the carnage Agatu suffered in the hands of the herdsmen.The body had in a statement said: ‘what we see happening in Agatu, today, can be likened to the happening in the Northeast… the people of Idoma nation are helpless in the fight against suspected Fulani herdsmen with over 300 Agatu people killed and others maimed in one week… A lot of Agatu people have been rendered homeless with thousands taking refuge in Ugbokpo, Adoka,Iga, Otukpo among others.

Besides Benue, Plateau and Taraba communities,communities in Enugu, Delta, Edo, Imo,Ondo, Oyo, Nasarawa, Kaduna, Anambra among other states have also tasted the bloody fury of the herdsmen who have sacked farmlands, hacked down protesting farmers, raped women and destroyed properties.

Meanwhile, Mark was close to tears last week when he visited Agatu to assess the level of destruction there. The ex- Senate President whose convoy came under gun shots from suspected herdsmen as he made his way into the embattled town described the Agatu carnage as genocide: “I am shocked beyond words at the extent of destruction I have seen here in Agatu today. This is unbelievable and unimaginable. Nothing whatsoever justifies this destruction meted out to the people of Agatu. My heart bleeds.”

According to Senator Mark, the attack on Agatu was a planned and orchestrated genocide against his people and lamented that about 10 communities were razed down to rubble by the herdsmen while no fewer than 500 lives were lost. “The villages are totally bereft of any social or economic activities. All the primary and post primary schools, health centres, worship centres as well as the police stations in the area have been burnt down. What is left of a hitherto boisterous Agatu communities of Aila, Akwu, Adagbo, Okokolo, Ugboju, Odugbeho, Ogbaulu, Egba and Obagayi are the debris of the wreckage,” Mark lamented.

The immediate past governor of the state, Gabriel Suswam, was the first high profile personality in Benue to taste the herdsmen’s fury when in March, 2014 his convoy came under barrage of gun attacks by suspected Fulani herdsmen. The then governor was heading to Tee-Akanyi in Guma Local council area of the state to visit villages raided by the herdsmen which left about 30 villagers beheaded, when he was attacked at Umenger area of the state.
