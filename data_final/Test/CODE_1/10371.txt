Bosnia has marked the 23rd anniversary of a massacre in the village of Ahmici during the Bosnian War.

Readings from the Quran and prayers took place during the ceremony on Saturday before visiting the graves of the victims.

Members of the Croatian Defense Council on 16 April 1993 killed 11 minors, 32 women and 73 men in Ahmici. The youngest victim was a three-month-old baby.

The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has ruled that the murders in Ahmici were crimes against humanity.

Habiba Ramic, a survivor of the massacre told Anadolu Agency that she has been forced to pursue a lonely life with her two children due to the massacre.

"My children are growing but my husband cannot see them growing. They wanted to kill us because our names are different," said Ramic.

Amina Ahmic, who was an unborn child during the massacre said that she did “not know what the word ‘father’ means."

The massacre in Ahmici, where Bosnian Croats turned against Bosnian Muslims, has been defined as the single most savage example of ethnic cleansing in the Balkans.

The war in Bosnia ended in 1995. Since that time, hundreds of Bosniak families are still searching for missing people, large numbers of civilians who were killed and thrown into mass graves around the country.

Around 8,400 people still remain missing after the war, according to the Institute for Missing Persons in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
