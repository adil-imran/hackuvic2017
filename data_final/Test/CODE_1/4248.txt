Christopher Halliwell may have murdered six more people, a former detective has revealed

Taxi driver Christopher Halliwell may have murdered six more people, a former detective has revealed.

The convicted murderer has already been linked to the disappearance of chef Claudia Lawrence and three other missing women.

But ex-detective Steve Fulcher yesterday said Halliwell may have murdered eight people in all and police should have done more to investigate him.

Halliwell, 52, was found guilty of the murder of Swindon sex worker Becky Godden last week, five years after he abducted and killed night clubber Sian O’ Callaghan from the same town.

Former detective superintendent Mr Fulcher caught Hailliwell in March 2011 and elicited a confession out of him that led police to the shallow grave where Miss Godden, 20, had lain since 2003.

Mr Fulcher, now a security consultant in Somalia, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday that there was ‘unquestionable’ evidence that Hailliwell killed again.

He said: ’I spent a lot of time with Christopher Hailliwell. He was contrite, fully contrite, crying on my shoulder when I dealt with him.

‘There’s no question, from all the information I gathered when I was running this inquiry in 2011, that he has committed other murders.

‘There’s lots of things, but the principal thing he said was, “the police want to interview me about eight murders”.’

Police investigating Hailliwell were aware of York chef Claudia Lawrence, who went missing in 2009 ‘a few streets’ away from where the taxi driver’s father once lived, Mr Fulcher said.

Detectives also knew Halliwell had a ‘direct relationship’ with Linda Razzell, who vanished after setting off to work at Swindon College in 2002. Her body has never been found.

Her husband Glynn is currently serving a life sentence for her murder, but still claims he is innocent.

Mr Fulcher said: ‘We know that Hailliwell has killed women, has a propensity for killing women, and had a direct relationship with Linda Razzell.

‘Whether or not he’s responsible for those murders isn’t the issue. The issue is why was no investigation conducted into those issues?’

Miss Godden’s mother Karen Edwards, 55, also believes her daughter’s killer could also be responsible for the murders of his neighbour Sally Ann John and Melanie Hall, who was last seen leaving a Bath nightclub in 1996 in an unmarked taxi.

A Wiltshire Police spokesman said yesterday: ‘It remains our commitment to keep an open mind and follow the evidence wherever that may take us, so if there are further victims of Halliwell, then our investigation will work tirelessly to bring justice for all those concerned.’

Father-of-three Hailliwell, formerly of Nythe in Swindon, originally confessed to murdering Miss Godden after leading Mr Fulcher to the field where he had dumped the body of Miss O’Callaghan.

But the confessions were later ruled inadmissible by a High Court judge because Mr Fulcher failed to caution the killer.

The detective was later found guilty of gross misconduct by a police disciplinary panel before he resigned from Wiltshire Police several months later, ending his 27-year police career.

Mr Fulcher said yesterday that there was a flaw in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, which prevented police officers from acting in the interests of victims.
