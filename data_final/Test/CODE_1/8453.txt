TWITTER/GETTY WARNING: An ex-spy has predicted that London is next on ISIS' hit list

Ex-spy Tony Schiena also urged Prime Minister David Cameron to scour files of all suspected terrorists already within our borders because "we are at war". Europe has been rocked after at least 34 people and more than 200 were wounded in a series of rush-hour bombings at an airport and Metro station in the Belgian capital. ISIS, also known as Daesh, claim responsibility for the Brussels attack and chilling images of three suspects strolling passed security are being circulated. A manhunt is underway for a third man – pictured in the far right in CCTV – who is the only one of the trio not thought to have blown himself up.

Lieutenant Colonel and Special Detective Schiena – who has witnessed ISIS warfare firsthand in Iraq – said an operation by the militants in London "will happen". "I think London is a matter of time," said world–renowned mercenary Schiena, speaking to the Daily Star Online today. "It's a very watched city but it's not impenetrable because they (ISIS) are already here and we don't have a million spies on the ground and we don't have the budget for that. "Until the entire world is at war with terrorism, until there is a ramping up of procedures, it will happen. "The only way to stop it is being proactive.

"Going back and scrubbing those intelligence files and certain records but it's very difficult with privacy laws and if only these laws could be a little more lenient." Schiena thinks the atrocities in Brussels were predictable. The surveillance expert also believes detectives foiled a greater disaster in capturing key Paris attacks suspect Salah Abdeslam – but in catching him actually fast-tracked a scaled-down ISIS plot today.

“They're within our borders and this threat is only going to increase” Tony Schiena "They're within our borders and this threat is only going to increase," he said. "On the morning of the Paris shootings I was doing an interview with Vice news and I said 'watch out, they're going to retaliate for losing the town of Sinjar in Iraq' and that afternoon they hit Paris. "And now Brussels, two days after they had a key operative wounded and arrested." Schiena, born in South Africa to a Dutch mum and Italian dad, was recruited by his college professor into the nation's intelligence service during the Apartheid.

He eventually went private for stints working with military in USA, Baghdad, Afghanistan, Cambodia, France, Hungary, Mongolia, Croatia and in Italy. The undefeated world heavyweight karate champion hit headlines last year when he lifted the lid on evidence that ISIS were using chemical weapons against Kurds in Iraq. While training around 30 commanders for Kurdish Peshmerga force last year he claims he clambered five hours up into the mountains to visit an entire community blistered, blinded and paralysed by mustard gas. The war crime breaches Barack Obama's "red line" policy and the proof persuaded Prince Ali of Jordan to donate a first batch of 1,000 gas masks to the Kurdish force.

"ISIS' weapons are weird," said Schiena. "In some cases it's rudimentary. They've got gas canisters and sown them onto wings. "Then you also have a lot of former Iraqi military weapons issued by NATO and the US." He added: "ISIS are as horrific as you're seeing on the news, if not worse "ISIS are also very good marketers, taking advantage of Twitter, Facebook and other network devices to help in the recruitment process."
