A Cyprus solution will dramatically change the stability outlook of the region, Dutch MEP and rapporteur on Turkey’s accession progress Kati Piri said on Tuesday.

Presenting the text of the 2015 draft progress report she compiled on behalf of the Europarliament’s Foreign Affairs committee, Piri noted the prospect of the island’s reunification, saying “40% of all the amendments on this report are made year after year”, but noted that “this is the year to pay attention to Cyprus” as “a solution to an over 40-year division is at hand”.

“This is due to the tireless efforts of the two community leaders to reach a settlement,” the MEP said.

Piri reiterated the need for Turkey to support the solution process actively.

In the report, the rapporteur praised the “considerable progress achieved in the reunification talks of Cyprus”.

“The committee commends the constructive approach of the leaders of both the Greek and Turkish communities on the island, and their determination and tireless efforts to reach a fair, comprehensive and viable settlement before the end of this year,” the report read.

Calling on the EU to “fully support the settlement, both politically and financially”, the Foreign Affairs committee called on Turkey, and “all parties concerned”, to actively support the negotiations process and the outcome, and to “withdraw its troops from Cyprus”.

Piri also welcomed President Nicos Anastasiades’ initiative to make Turkish – one of Cyprus’ official languages, per the country’s 1960 constitution – an official language of the EU, and deplored “Turkey’s refusal to fulfill its obligation of full, non-discriminatory implementation of the additional protocol to the EC-Turkey association agreement vis-à-vis all member states”, i.e. to recognise the Republic of Cyprus.

Following the unveiling of the draft report’s text, discussion will begin with a view to adopting it by April.

With the exception of ruling DISY, the report drew criticism from across the political spectrum in Cyprus.

“Turkey’s path to Europe goes through a solution to the Cyprus problem,” said DISY’s political planning director Charalambos Stavrides.

“It is obvious that, without celebrations and chest-beating, the President’s strategy is bearing fruit.”

AKEL MEP Takis Hadjigeorgiou argued the report could do with a reference to Turkish settlers.

“There has been ethnic cleansing in Cyprus and mainland Turks were carried over to alter the island’s demographic character,” he said.

And, since the report welcomes the two leaders’ tireless efforts to solve the problem, there was no need for a reference to “all parties concerned” to support the negotiations process. Instead, the call should be solely directed to Turkey, he said.

EDEK MEP Demetris Papadakis thought that while the report largely depicts reality on the situation in Turkey, he argued in favour of a clear reference that the settlement of the Cyprus problem should be “fully compatible with the acquis communautaire and in line with the principles and values of the European Union”.

Most harsh of all was a statement by the Solidarity movement, headed by MEP Eleni Theocharous.

Branding the report “unacceptable”, the movement said that the text is tailored to the Turkish view of a “defunct” Republic of Cyprus, while, in an unacceptable manner, not only meticulously avoiding any reference to Turkey’s obligation to recognise the Republic of Cyprus, but referring to the “opening of border crossings”.

“The report has serious shortcomings and absolves Turkey, since it calls on ‘all parties involved’ to support a solution, a view that comes at odds with the nature of the problem as one of invasion and occupation,” Solidarity said.
