On the eve of the fifth anniversary Tuesday of the ongoing violent conflict in Syria, sustainable peace seems far from reach. Despite a partial ceasefire and an announcement Monday from Russia that it would withdraw troops from the region, the future of the war-torn country remains uncertain.

The conflict centers around Syrian President Bashar Assad, who took power in 2000 following his father's death. While citizens were at first hopeful that the young Assad would usher in a more democratic government, he quickly followed in his father's footsteps â€” leading with an iron fist, cracking down on dissent and protests and imprisoning political dissidents. As anti-government protests grew throughout the nation in the spring of 2011, violent clashes eventually spiraled into war, with pro- and anti-government factions increasingly split along sectarian lines.

Here's a look back at what started the Syrian civil war and how it has progressed over five bloody years.

November 2011: The Arab League votes to suspend Syria and issues sanctions on the country.
