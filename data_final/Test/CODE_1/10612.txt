Parliament speaker’s advisor blasts Saudi Arabia’s massacre of Yemeni civilians in Sana’a

TEHRAN (FNA)- Senior Advisor to the Iranian Parliament Speaker Hossein Amir Abdollahian condemned the Saudi airstrikes on Sana’a that killed and wounded hundreds of civilians who were attending a funeral procession.

“The Saudi rulers have made the resistant people of Yemen to lose their temper,” Amir Abdollahian said.

The Saudi fighter jets pounded the funeral procession of the father of Yemeni interior minister in Sana’a which killed and wounded over 700 people.

“(Saudi Foreign Minister) Adel al-Jubeir told me with prejudice in Jeddah 16 months ago that Saudi Arabia will become victorious within coming days and now we see the mess that his country has created there,” Amir Abdollahian added.

He reiterated that it is for 16 months that Saudi Arabia is madly continuing its attacks in Yemen.

“Saudi Arabia is caught in quagmire in Yemen; the popular resistance shows that Riyadh will have more difficult days in Yemen,” Amir Abdollahian said.

He termed the Saudi rulers as puppets of the US and Israel, and said, “The Saudi rulers are acting foolishly.”

Reports from Yemen’s capital said on Saturday that over 700 people have been killed or wounded in massive air raids by the Saudi-led coalition warplanes.

The airstrikes targeted a hall where people were paying their last respects to the father of Yemen’s Interior Minister Jalal Al-Rouyshan who is also the chief of staff of former President Ali Abdullah Salih.

A second strike hit exactly the same region as people rushed to aid those injured in the first round of air assault.

Also, the Saudi warplanes staged massive airstrikes on a ceremony on the house of Sheikh Abu Shwareb, inflicting tens of casualties on the civilians who had gathered for a ceremony at his residence.

A source said that the total count of those injured and dead has reached 716 so far.
