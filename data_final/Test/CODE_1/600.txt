A British alleged superhacker should be extradited to the United States to face trial where he could be jailed for 99 years, a judge ruled today.

Asperger's sufferer Lauri Love, 31, allegedly hacked huge amounts of data from US agencies including the Federal Reserve, Nasa and the FBI between 2012 and 2013.

British judge Nina Tempia today agreed with the American authorities and ruled the 31-year-old, who lives with his parents near Newmarket in Suffolk, should face a cyber-hacking trial in America.

Mr Love, who will appeal to the High Court, said after today's judgment: 'If you have come for justice then you have missed it'.

His father Reverend Alexander Love added: 'It is not fair or just that a boy with mental health issues is taken away from his family and support network to the US. It is wrong. Our confidence is not in the legal system but in God'.

His case is 'almost identical' to that of fellow hacker Gary McKinnon, whose extradition was blocked by then Home Secretary Theresa May in 2012.

Angry: His father Rev Alexander Love says that Britain should not bow to the will of America, who he says are out to punish his son

Protest: Supporters of Lauri Love bring traffic to a standstill outside Westminster Magistrates' Court in London

Message: :Protesters were singing, playing music and chanting 'no love for the US gov' as time is running out for Mr Love

Mr Love stood in the dock at Westminster Magistrates' Court, wearing a purple sash as a belt, as district judge Nina Tempia ruled he can be extradited to the US, where he could face the possibility of three separate trials in different jurisdictions.

'I'm going to extradite Mr Love but what I mean by that is I'm going to send his case to the Secretary of State,' Judge Tempia told the hearing.

He said that he fears she will grant the request. ‘I can’t contemplate the prospect of being extradited to the US because I can’t see my life beyond that,’ he added.

Mr Love faces a possible 99-year prison sentence if convicted in America - but has the right to appeal against his extradition.

There were gasps in the court room as Mr Love was read the ruling, which followed a case hearing in June at Westminster Magistrates' Court.

WHAT NEXT FOR 'SUPERHACKER' LAURI LOVE? Struggle: Lauri Love's family fear he will kill himself if sent to America to face trial without the support of his family Lauri Love will have to mount a fresh High Court challenge to stop his extradition to the US. After today's ruling Home Secretary Amber Rudd will be asked to agree or block the US extradition request. If she agrees to the request he must go to America Mr Love's legal team can go to the High Court seeking a judicial review of the home secretary's decision not to block his transfer. The Home Secretary has 14 days to respond before a judge considers it. If he or she sides with Mr Love then he is likely to stay in the UK. If he loses, a final appeal to the Supreme Court could be lodged before only a direct intervention from the Home Secretary could save him. In 2012 fellow hacker Gary McKinnon had his extradition was blocked by then Home Secretary Theresa May in 2012.

He was told he had 14 days to appeal the decision.

The 31-year-old embraced friends and family, who appeared shocked and angry by the decision.

'If you have come for justice then you have missed it,' Mr Love told a crowd of press in the courtroom afterwards.

Mr Love, who suffers from anxiety and depression, also said that he was surprised Mr McKinnon’s case had not set a legal precedent.

‘There couldn’t be a closer test case. Gary’s case is replicated here,’ he added.

‘The public clearly had concerns about the extradition treaty with the US following his case and the Mail campaign, which is why things were supposed to have changed.’

His father damned the laws that could see his son sent to America.

Reverend Alexander Love, a prison chaplain, said he often feared he would find his son, who has been deemed a high suicide risk by medical experts, dead when he returned home.

He said: 'I am obviously very upset. I always believed that to be here [in the UK] was to have won the lottery and I thought our laws were just.

'The judge has made a judgement on a law that is flawed. It is not right that my son has been taken away. It is not fair or just that a boy with mental health issues is taken away from his family and support network to the US.

'It is wrong and I hope the high court will be able to make that case. Our confidence is not in the legal system but in God.

'We have had a big discussion about who should be let into this country, but we need to have one about who should be taken out'.

Defiant: Mr Love, who will appeal to the High Court, raised his arm in the air as he said he had not got justice

Protest: Outside Westminster Magistrate's Court, supporters wearing stickers and hold banners blocked the road, bringing traffic to a standstill.

Mr Love's solicitor, Karen Todner, confirmed that they would be appealing against the result.

She said: 'This is not the end of the road, we are going to lodge an appeal, we are still hopeful the appeal will be successful in the High Court.'

Outside Westminster Magistrate's Court, supporters blocked the road, bringing traffic to a standstill.

Playing music and dancing, they chanted 'no love for the US gov', while angry commuters beeped their horns and gestured at them to move.

WHAT IS ASPERGER'S? Asperger syndrome is a lifelong developmental disability that affects how people perceive the world and interact with others. People with Asperger syndrome see, hear and feel the world differently to other people. If you have Asperger syndrome, you have it for life – it is not an illness or disease and cannot be 'cured'. Often people feel that Asperger syndrome is a fundamental aspect of their identity. Autism is a spectrum condition. All autistic people share certain difficulties, but being autistic will affect them in different ways. Some people with Asperger syndrome also have mental health issues or other conditions, meaning people need different levels and types of support. People with Asperger syndrome are of average or above average intelligence. They do not usually have the learning disabilities that many autistic people have, but they may have specific learning difficulties. They have fewer problems with speech but may still have difficulties with understanding and processing language. Source: The National Autistic Society

They were eventually moved on by police.

Judge Tempia said Mr Love's rights under article eight of the European Convention on Human Rights - the right to a private and family life - were 'clearly engaged'.

But she added: 'In balancing the factors for and against extradition I am satisfied that the very strong counter-balancing factors required to find extradition would be disproportionate are not found in this case.'

She said Mr Love faces 'extremely serious charges for offences of computer hacking' and while she acknowledged his physical and mental health issues, she was 'satisfied' his needs would met by US authorities.

She added: 'I am satisfied Mr Love's extradition would be compatible with his convention rights and I send this case to the Secretary of State for her decision as to whether or not Mr Love should be extradited.'

Outside court Mr Love's solicitor Karen Todner said they were 'extremely disappointed' with the decision.

'Most of this judgment is about the defence case, the prosecution didn't actually call any evidence,' she told a huge pack of reporters.

'This is not the end of the road, we are going to lodge an appeal, we are still hopeful the appeal will be successful in the High Court.'

Ahead of Friday's hearing, Mr Love said he held little hope of justice if he was extradited, and suggested a jail term in the US could cause his health to deteriorate and would lead to a mental breakdown or suicide.

He and his family want him to face justice in the UK rather than the US, which he said 'coerces' people into pleading guilty to get reduced sentences.

Warning: Janis Sharp, the mother of Gary McKinnon (pictured together), who was saved from extradition by Theresa May, warned that Mr Love would not survive in the US justice system

Gary McKinnon's mother Janis Sharp warned yesterday that the hacker would not survive life in the US justice system.

'He has Asperger's, is nervous, scared and suicidal and is in a really bad way,' she said.

'I am worried he will be extradited and end up in an American prison, which doesn't have the same standards as jails in Britain.

Upset: Lauri Love's mother Sirkka-Liisa Love and sister Natasha, outside Westminster Magistrates' Court, London, where a judge ruled that Lauri, who is accused of hacking into US Government computers, can be extradited

'If this happens, I worry that he won't survive as American jails are terrible places. I just hope that Gary didn't go through all of this for nothing.'

Speaking about Mr Love, who has Finnish and British dual nationality, she said: 'He's very intelligent but he is also naïve, innocent and vulnerable.

'He is terrified at the prospect of going to America, but he's also hopeful that the courts will do the right thing. It is ridiculous to extradite him with no evidence.'

Mr Love, who is studying electrical engineering at Suffolk university, has spent the past three years in legal limbo, waiting to learn his fate.

Speaking to the Mail, the vicar's son, from Newmarket, Suffolk, said he was 'apprehensive but optimistic' about today's judgment.

'I've been having weird dreams and trouble getting to sleep,' he said. 'I've not been getting openly stressed, but it comes out in my eczema.

'I feel more for my parents. They're at an age when they should have a quieter life but I'm hoping that after the judgment things will be easier for them.

'U.S. prisons are not good for people with mental health problems. If I am sent to an American jail, I don't see anything positive happening after that.

'It'll be reasserting British sovereignty if I am not extradited and it's important that our courts are sovereign.'

Mr Love faces 12 counts of hacking between October 2012 and October 2013 across the states of New York, New Jersey and Virginia, and could face trials in three separate states in the U.S.

Sarah Harrison, director of the Courage Foundation, which runs Mr Love’s defence fund and support campaign, said: ‘Frankly, if the forum bar can’t help Lauri Love, it’s very difficult to understand how it could ever help anyone.

‘This is not something we should stand for.’

Mr Love’s solicitor Karen Todner confirmed they would be appealing the decision.

How vulnerable British 'hacker' deemed a suicide risk could be condemned to life in a US jail

Lauri Love could spend decades in prison if he is extradited and convicted of hacking into US Government computers, his lawyers have said

Lauri Love could spend decades in prison if he is extradited and convicted of hacking into US Government computers, his lawyers have said.

The 31-year-old has spoken of his fears about extradition, saying he holds little hope for justice in the US, and suggested a jail term there could cause his health to deteriorate and would lead to a mental breakdown or suicide.

Mr Love, from Suffolk and who has Asperger Syndrome, had hoped his case would set a 'positive' precedent, allowing him to be tried at home in the UK.

Speaking ahead of the extradition ruling, Mr Love told the Press Association: 'I don't think that any humane person would send someone to the US prison system, especially someone who is not from America and has never been there.

'If this precedent prevents that from happening again I think that's a very positive statement.'

Tor Ekeland, Mr Love's US lawyer and an expert in hacking cases, said he feared the American justice system would 'destroy his life'.

That life has been a complicated one. Mr Love's parents recognised his remarkable intelligence from a young age, the prison chaplain and his wife dazzled by their son's brilliance.

But the Reverend Alexander Love admitted that his exceptional mind blinded them to his problems, which became pronounced in his teenage years when the family moved home.

Frightened: Mr Love may need the Government to intervene in his case if he is avoid being forced over to America

Mr Love developed mental health issues while at school, losing all his hair through stress, and retreated into a world of computers.

While his parents saw how clever and bright he was, he told them he felt his life was pointless.

Mr Love tried to move to Finland, his mother's native country, but came back after a few months 'a mess, very down, feeling like a failure'.

A move to university in Nottingham ended in the second term after a physical and mental breakdown which saw his skin conditions worsen and the development of bronchial infections.

In 2006 he was treated for psychotic episodes and anxiety. He tried to go to university in Glasgow but had to be brought home in the second year after suffering from shingles, the tonsillitis disease quinsy, and scarlet fever.

During his hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court in June Mr Love spoke of the 'despondency' his undiagnosed health problems brought him as a child, saying 'there wouldn't be a year in my life where I wouldn't have an episode' of depression.

'We are all invested in making a better world for each other. Sometimes that involves confrontational situations with people in power.' Lauri Love on his 'hacktivism'

But he said he was 'unwilling to burden others' with his problems.

His physical issues were all too apparent as he scratched uncontrollably at his eczema while he gave evidence from the witness stand during the case.

And his mental acuity was obvious as he listened intently to legal arguments from the court dock, interjecting on points of law or at times when he felt there was a moral point to be made, all the while crafting an intricate geometric globe from pieces of card and wearing a red origami rose in his lapel he had made earlier.

Perhaps most telling was when he became choked up and held back tears as he told the court how he launched into hacktivism following the 2013 death of 'wunderkind' Aaron Swartz, an internet pioneer who hanged himself after being accused by US authorities of wire fraud when he set up a system to download academic journals at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

Mr Love explained: 'We are all invested in making a better world for each other. Sometimes that involves confrontational situations with people in power.'

Today Mr Love works in 'ethical hacking' and advises organisations on cyber-security through the organisation My Hacker House, helping teach youngsters online skills, and studies electrical engineering at the University Campus Suffolk.

He told the court that he wants to 'be in a position that the talents I have are most effectively applied to making this world a better place'.

Mr Love's lawyers said they intend to appeal the extradition ruling.

How the Mail fought to keep Gary safe

Gary McKinnon (pictured) also faced extradition to the US but was spared after an extraordinary campaign led by the Daily Mail

Gary McKinnon also faced extradition to the US but was spared after an extraordinary campaign led by the Daily Mail.

The Affront to British Justice series generated huge support from readers, politicians and celebrities, including Sting and Julie Christie.

Mr McKinnon, now 50, believed the US government was hiding information about UFOs that could lead to the production of clean and free energy, and that he had a moral duty to expose it.

In March 2002, he was arrested at his North London flat by police acting on allegations from the US that he had immobilised hundreds of defence computers, interrupted the supply of vital munitions to American warships in the Atlantic, and caused £500,000 worth of damage. After a 2006 ruling by magistrates that he should be sent to the US, the House of Lords backed the decision in 2008, and the European Court of Human Rights gave its approval in August of that year.

However, that same summer Mr McKinnon was diagnosed with Asperger’s, which can spark obsessive behaviour in sufferers, as well as a lack of appreciation of the consequences of their actions. Experts also argued he would be vulnerable to suicide.
