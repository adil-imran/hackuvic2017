Phison Electronics Corp (群聯), a Taiwan-based NAND flash controller supplier, plans to consolidate two overseas subsidiaries that have been embroiled in a financial scandal in a bid to enhance the company’s long-term development, a company financial statement said yesterday.

Phison’s decision came after prosecutors and investigators raided company offices, as well as the offices of subsidiary Ostek Corp (曜成), in Hsinchu last weekend on suspicion that Phison inflated revenues and profits via three subsidiaries, including Ostek and two offshore businesses.

Investigators said that the company had hidden fake transactions of US$40 million between Phison and its subsidiaries during the period from 2009 to 2014.

Yuanta Securities Investment Consulting Co (元大投顧) said in a report that the US$40 million is not significant, as it implies only US$7 million in fake transactions per year over the alleged six-year period, compared with Phison’s revenue of more than NT$33 billion (US$1.05 billion) in 2014.

However, investors’ focus is likely to be on the undisclosed transactions, Yuanta said.

The stock price of Phison yesterday tumbled 1.52 percent to NT$226.5. The stock has plunged 15.96 percent since the financial scandal erupted on Aug. 5.

Phison chairman Pua Khein-seng (潘健成) was questioned about alleged violations of the Securities and Exchange Act (證券交易法), and was released on bail of NT$20 million and barred from leaving the nation.

The company’s latest financial statement showed that it booked NT$5.62 billion in revenue from the two overseas subsidiaries in the first half of last year. The figures went down to zero in the first six months of this year, the financial statement showed.

“In consideration of the company’s long-standing development and better corporate structure, the company plans to consolidate the two companies,” Phison said in the statement.

The consolidation will not affect the interests of the company’s shareholders, the company said.

Ostek’s financial figures have been consolidated into Phison’s financial statements since December last year.

Phison, which counts Toshiba Corp as one of its major clients, said the investigation would not affect the company’s financial situation and operations at the moment, but added that it cannot decide how the probe would affect the firm in the long run.

Phison’s net profit rose 6.63 percent to NT$1.93 billion in the first half, compared with NT$1.81 billion in the same period last year, the statement showed.

That can be translated into earnings per share of NT$9.58 in the first half, up from NT$9.15 in the same period last year.

The company posted 14.21 percent in revenue for last month at NT$3.79 billion, up from NT$3.32 billion in July last year.

That brought the company’s revenue in the first seven months to NT$24.15 billion, up 20.15 percent from NT$20.1 billion during the same period last year.
