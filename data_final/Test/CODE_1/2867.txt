With a landmass covering about 24, 192 KM2, large water bodies and a population of over six million people, Katsina State has the needed resource to be self-sufficient in agriculture. In this piece, MUAZU ELAZEH writes that the state’s potentials to boost food production especially using irrigation farming, is grossly under-utilised.

Arguably, farmers in Katsina state have the potential to feed not only the state’s over six million population but also feed neighbouring states owing to the boundless agricultural potentials that are visible all over the state.

Indeed, one of such potential waiting to be effectively harnessed is the presence of three major dams located in Sabke, Zobe and Jibiya communities of the state. These dams are effective tools for an all year round farming if properly repositioned. But it appears they are being under-utilised.

Of course, in Katsina State, understandably because of its vast agricultural potentials and consequent upon the fact that agriculture still remains the mainstay of its economy, there is the existence of three major dams,mainly funded by the federal government with the support of the state government.

These dams are the Zobe Dam, located in Garhi village of Dutsinma local government, Jibiya Dam and Sabke dam, located in Jibiya and Maiadua local government areas respectively.

Beside aiming to address challenges of water supply for both domestic and industrial use, these dams were original concieved to also boost irrigation farming.

Irrigation farming is incontestably, a strong and vibrant component of food crop farming because it guarantees all season farming in a seasonal environment like Nigeria.

Importantly, irrigation farming strive to keep farmers perpetually engaged all year round and ultimately, improves their economic fortunes and boost the food supply base of a nation and its peoples.

Apart from serving as a tool for facilitating sustained food security, irrigation farming also serves as an avenue for generating massive employment.

It is a widely held belief that Nigeria and indeed most developing nations, cannot afford to feed their selves by merely depending only on rain fed agriculture without fully tapping the potentials of irrigation.

Undoubtedly, it is the realisation of this fact that gingered the federal government to embark on the construction of dams ostensibly to encourage irrigation farming.

One of such noble but unfortunately, often neglected initiatives are the 3 dams project in Katsina state.

Zobe Dam

Essentially, the zobe dam was commissioned in 1983 by the then civilian administration of Alhaji Shehu Shagari. With an embankment length of three thousand metres (3000m) and the height of nineteen metres (19m), the dam was constructed for irrigation purposes. It was designed to irrigate eight thousand (8000) hectares of irrigable land but later reduced to five thousand hectares’ due to regional water supply.

Leadership Weekend gathered that parts of the salient features of the dam included a crest width of five metres (5m) and a reservoir capacity of one hundred and seventy seven cubic metres (177m) full storage. Importantly, the dam has a catchments area of two thousand, three hundred and nine square kilometers (2309sq. Km).

The zobe dam was constructed basically to boost irrigation farming in an agriculturally friendly environment of Dutsinma and neighbouring settlements considering the fact that the main stay of the people of the area is farming for which the entire northern region was known.

Strangely enough and perhaps typical of the Nigerian government, the dam which was essentially designed for irrigation was constructed without irrigation structures and has been so since the commissioning in the early eighties until government, few years back, deemed it fit to award contract for the construction of cannals to boost irrigation farming in the site.

It would be recalled that the Federal government through the ministry of agriculture and natural resources had in 2009, awarded contract for the construction of two main cannals with main cannal 1 (MC 1) expected to cover ten kilometres while the main canal 2 (MC 2) has the length of eleven kilometre.

It was gathered that the federal government awarded contract for the construction of the two cannals at the sum of N6.85 billion.

LEADERSHIP Weekend observed that years after the contract was awarded to a Chinese firm, CGC, work on the cannals, described by many as essential for the distribution of the much needed water for irrigation farming, is far from being completed.

Slow work on the two main cannals to boost irrigation farming in Zobe Dam of Katsina state is arguably hampering smooth irrigation farming in the area and has further cast doubts on the viability of the project as years after the construction of the dam, one cannot say with certainty whether the noble vision of boosting irrigation farming for which the dam was constructed has been realized or will be realised soon.

Irrigation farmers from the area who obviously have waited long but to no avail have resorted to using what was available as a result of necessity.

Understandably, what the farmers currently uses to ensure irrigation farming at the site is not good enough and the land currently been cultivated around the dam site by these determined but frustrated farmers, is not in all, up to five hundred hectares.

Speaking to LEADERSHIP Weekend, an irrigation farmer, Mallam Rufai Mukhtari appealed to government to hasten the completion of work on the irrigation component of the dam so as to fastrack irrigation farming.

“We use water from tube well to water our crops and it takes a whole day job to get water that could hardly serve a small part of the farm.What this has led to is that most of the crops die off and most of us are forced to cultivate small parcel of land” Mukhtari enthused.

Mallam Yahya Yusuf is the secretary of Garhi (a settlement close to the zobe dam) irrigation farmers association. He told LEADERSHIP Weekend that the ever resilient farmers, have despite all odds, been engaged in effective utilisation of the less than six hundred hectares available to engage in the farming of pepper, tomatoes, maize and wheat for both local consumption and sales to people who trooped in to buy on a daily basis.

“We have refused to be discouraged by the attitude of the government and have since realised the need for effective utilisation of the available site which is exactly what we are doing.” Yahaya said.

He said over 5000 metric tons of cereal and vegetables have been produced by the farmers during the last irrigation season inspite of the fact that the site has not been fully utilized for lack of adequate irrigation structures noting “imagine the number of tons we will produce if all the necessary materials are available.”

Understandably therefore, the noble and indeed, much cherished intention of boosting irrigation farming for which the dam was constructed is yet to be achieved even as both the irrigation farmers and indeed the government are agreed that the dam has the potentials of boosting the food supply base of Katsina State and by implication, the nation at large.

It is an established fact that food dependence is the worst form of dependence and a nation that cannot truly feed itself cannot be in any way referred to as an independent nation. This assertion is time tested as is the reality of human dependence on food for survival.

Nigerian and indeed, most developing countries are facing food challenges consequent upon which importation became the last option ostensibly to augment the short fall in supply. Analysts are agreed that with a vast land and a favourable climate, the nation has no reason whatsoever not to feed itself and possibly export food stuffs to other countries. Unfortunately, this has been a pipe dream due to government neglect. It is this neglect that is responsible for the inability of the nation to achieve the maximum benefit from the zobe dam projects.

Jibiya Dam

As earlier noted, there is also the Jibiya dam which is located in the Niger Republic border local government area of Jibiya in the state.

It was gathered that work on the Jibiya dam commenced in 1986 and was completed in 1992 under the Sokoto Rima River Basin Development Authority of the federal ministry of water resources with basic irrigation components in tact.

Findings indicated that the Jibiya dam project has three components of a Dam, Irrigation site and water treatment plant for water supply for domestic use.

The dam has an embankment of 3.68m in length, 19.5m depth with a capacity of 142 million cubic metre flood storage capacity.

It was observed that the irrigation network of Jibiya dam consists of power house, pumping station and irrigation area of 3500 hectares.

To effectively support the irrigation component, four generators, each having 800kva were installed at the power house to supply electricity for constant supply of water to the irrigation site.

The dam has a 26sq kilometre water reservoir with a length of 11 kilometres. There are also two compensation reservoirs with capacities of 35,000 and 45,000 cubic metres respectively at the site. There are eight pumps at the pumping station. These pump water to the first and second reservoir with each having four pumps attached to it.

The irrigation site is divided into six with the first reservoir feeding three areas while the second reservoir feeds two areas.

There are six fields in the Jibiya dam irrigation site.

Sources said the dam has the capacity for the cultivation of over 3000 hectares of land for irrigation farming but less than 600 hectare is currently being utilised.

Sabke Dam

One of such dams with huge potentials for irrigation farming but not being fully tapped is the Sabke dam located in Maiadua local government area of the state.

It was constructed in 1995.The idea to construct the dam was originally conceived by the defunct petroleum trust fund (PTF) that supported its construction.

Like both Jibiya and Zobe dams, the original concept of sabke dam was for it to support irrigation and possibly provide water for domestic use. As a result, the project has three components of dam, pumping station and irrigation area. Work on the dam which was handled by SCC culminated in its completion in 1995 but years after that, full irrigation farming has not commenced on the dam because work on other components of irrigation area and pumping station had not been completed.

Although the dam has the capacity for the cultivation of one thousand, five hundred (1500) hectares, impecable sources said at the moment, less than fifteen acre, comprising mostly of areas close to the dam is currently being utilized by sabke irrigation farmers.

It was gathered that contract for the construction of the pumping station which has for long been abandoned, was awarded to a Chinese contracting firm.

LEADERSHIP Weekend reports that the pumping station is but a structure in ruin as weeds have taken over the available structure. It was observed that the proposed pumping station which is few metres away from the power house is in shamble with most of the buildings having neither doors nor windows.

Work on the pumping station which is meant to pump water to a compensation reservoir for onward distribution to various cannals so as to boost irrigation farming has been abandoned, there by causing a snag on the entire project.

The pumping station is in rubble with the structures vandalised.

It is gathered that the irrigation and drainage system was dependent on completion of work on the pumping station as that would provide opportunity to confirmed if the cannals were all functional but regrettably, the delay in completing the work on the pumping station has caused a snag.

Speaking to LEADERSHIP Weekend, a retired staff of Maiadua local government, Usman Ahmed Gwajogwajo appealed for the completion of work on the pumping station insisting that “as things stand out, the intention of the dam has not been achieved as the dam is grossly being under-utilized.”

Maigari Shuaibu is the leader of sabke irrigation farmers (Sarkin Manoma). He told our correspondent that over two hundred and fifty irrigation farmers currently shared the little irrigation site near the dam and insisted that delays in completing the pumping station is adversely affecting irrigation farming.

“The state government has indicated its commitment to supporting irrigation farming but the continued delay in completing work on the irrigation site is the major constraints we face at the moment,” he said.

… Farmers seeks completion of the irrigation projects

As should be expected, a cross section of farmers who spoke to our correspondent appealed to the government at all level to synergise with a view to ensuring that the irrigation components of the dams are put to effective use.

“We are in an era where the government said it was committed to boosting farming so as to ensure food security and economic prosperity. The talk in town now is that of diversification with agriculture holding the keys. government should hasten action on these dams and make especially the irrigation component fully functional” one Musa Bello Ibrahim said.

There is no contesting the fact that if fully put to use, the three major dams in Katsina State would contribute to the economic empowerment of many households as most will be gainfully engaged in the farming activities and other opportunities that the project will offer.

It is the hope and indeed expectations of not only the association of irrigation farmers but all well meaning residents that the irrigation projects would be completed and fully put into use so as to help strengthen irrigation farming and importantly, contribute towards ensuring sustained food security.

…Interventions from government

Although the three major dams which have the potentials of turning around the fortunes of Katsina State as far as irrigation farming is concerned are owned solely by the Federal government, the state government under the administration of Governor Aminu Bello Masari said it was making frantic moves ensure effective use of the dams.

An official of the state ministry of agriculture told LEADERSHIP Weekend that concerted efforts are being made to ensure proper take off of irrigation farming in the three major dam sites through completion of the irrigation components.

He recalled that in line with the state government’s effort to ensure all year round farming, irrigation infrastructure and production are embarked upon in which four dams; Masari, Ruwan Sanyi, Daberam and another in Katsina Zone will be develop for irrigation production for the year 2016.

“Approval has already been secured for the implementation of these projects and design and costing completed. Subsequent years, the state planned to develop a dam in each of the local government area where at least 10 hectares of land will be irrigated”

“The state government also supports the development of 3,000 hectares for irrigation in Jibia dam with about N40 million annually. The support include repair of irrigation infrastructures, fueling of water pumps, inputs support to farmers” he said.
