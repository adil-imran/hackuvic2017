It was with sadness that I read of Andrzej Wajda’s passing Sunday. The legendary Polish director was one of the artistic world’s clearest voices for freedom and justice in the face of tyranny, one who amassed a body of work with few equals.

Born in 1926 in Suwalki, Wajda lived through a series of national tragedies: the invasion and division of Poland at the hands of Hitler and Stalin; the repression of his people behind the Iron Curtain; and the crushing of Solidarity underneath the heel of the Soviet boot. This sense of national anguish was reflected throughout his work; as Leonard Quart noted in an essay accompanying the Criterion Collection’s release of “Danton,” “Among the great Polish filmmakers … Andrzej Wajda stands out as the one most concerned with national identity and memory.”

He burst onto the international scene in 1955 with “Generation,” the first in a trio of films about life in wartime Poland (the other two being “Kanal” and “Ashes and Diamonds”). It was Wajda’s later works that I came to love, however: anti-Communist pictures that skipped through history to highlight the absurdity and oppression of the Soviet system.

His 2007 movie “Katyn,” nominated for best foreign language picture at the 2008 Academy Awards, is the stirring, horrifying tale of the murder of more than 20,000 Poles by the Russian secret police in 1940 — a crime the Soviets lied about for years, a lie that Russia’s allies in World War II accepted for expediency in the war against Germany. Wajda’s own father was murdered in the eponymous forest, and his film follows the uncertainty faced by the families the dead left behind. Intricate, chilling and heartbreaking, “Katyn” gave faces to one of the more underappreciated crimes of the Second World War—one given new resonance by a resurgent Russia with renewed nationalist aims.

That “Man of Iron” exists at all is a rather remarkable fact. A ringing defense of Poland’s Solidarity movement and a stinging critique of the Communist Party that would, shortly after this film’s 1981 release, declare martial law in a severe crackdown on freedoms in the country, “Man of Iron” tells the tale of a state journalist ordered to undermine the burgeoning freedom movement. Another of Wajda’s Oscar-nominated films—he would win an honorary Academy Award in 2000 and his last film, “Afterimage,” is Poland’s offering for best foreign language feature at next year’s Oscars* — “Man of Iron” featured Solidarity co-founder Lech Walesa as himself and remains one of the more profound reminders of the stifling nature of Soviet repression and the ways in which the media can be used by the government as a means of control.

But it is “Danton” (1983) that remains my favorite of Wajda’s works. Set in the second year of the French Revolution, “Danton” features Gerard Depardieu in the title role of Georges Danton, a larger-than-life man of the people who earns the revolution’s ire after he becomes critical of its terror. Maximilien Robespierre (Wojciech Pszoniak) first tries to save Danton, knowing his execution would earn the enmity of the people, and then condemns him to the guillotine, understanding that a revolution sans zeal is a revolution sans engine.

Though Wajda had been considering the film for years and explicitly denies a connection between “Danton” and the crackdown occurring in Poland during the film’s production and release, audiences and critics alike were quick to highlight his critique of revolutionary repression: the smashing of presses, the show trials, the banning of assemblies. “They must kill me because I’m honest,” Danton says to his countrymen, appealing to the crowd while fighting for his life. “Because I tell the truth. Because I frighten them. Three reasons to murder a decent man!”

And he frames it all as a sort of horror story: the death not just of a man, but of an ideal. Robespierre himself looks like a ghost — drenched in fever sweet, near death’s door — a look accentuated by his followers, made pale as spirits by all the pancake makeup they wear. As the film begins, Danton is headed back into Paris. Traveling by carriage, he does a slow loop around the guillotine decorating the city center: shrouded in black, the death-dealing scaffold appears onscreen accompanied by ominous wails and brassy tones, calling to mind “The Shining” more than a staid, talky, political thriller.

Wajda’s boldest stroke was his casting and direction of his actors. A team of Poles was brought in to play Robespierre and his squad of goons, with French voice actors dubbed in after the fact. They bring a manic energy to the film, surrounding the icy, sickly Robespierre with a revolutionary zeal he otherwise seems to lack. And they complement Depardieu’s earthy, rotund sensibility nicely: His genuine love of life is a stark contrast to the manic ascetics on the other side of the aisle.

It’s unsurprising that the figure of Georges Danton would appeal to the Polish filmmaker. Andrzej Wajda was a lover of life, a despiser of lies, a critic of terror, an opponent of despair. He will be missed.

*I don’t believe awards should be doled out as favors to the dead, but it would be a shame if the Academy missed this final chance to give Wajda a competitive Oscar.
