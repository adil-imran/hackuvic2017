A Canadian lawmaker has called for a federal investigation into Beyonce’s links with the Black Panthers.

Toronto councilor Jim Karygiannis suggested Tuesday that Beyonce be banned from entering Canada on the basis the pop star promotes “gun culture” and “anti-police sentiments.”

The call comes after the pop star divided public opinion with a Super Bowl performance that paid homage to the Black Panthers, a radical socialist organization that lobbied for Black rights in the 1960s and 70s.

Karygiannis told the Toronto Sun he thought the show was “disturbing.”

With Beyonce due to arrive in Canada in May as part of her Formation World Tour, the councilor is calling for an investigation into the pop star and her alleged links to the Black Panthers.

“Perhaps Immigration Minister John McCallum should have her investigated first?” he told the Toronto Sun. “If someone wore bullets and supported (a radical group) here, they would not be welcomed in the United States — that’s for sure.”

While Beyonce cannot be prevented from entering Canada solely on the basis of her Super Bowl performance, there may be legal grounds for a ban if she is found to have financially supported the Black Panthers, Karagiannis says.

The fact that Beyonce was aged just one when the Black Panthers disbanded in 1982 seems to have eluded Karagiannis.

Beyonce has not responded to the comments.

This is not the first time the Canadian councilor has expressed reactionary views.

In 2011, the Greece-born politician angered the Macedonian community by calling them “Skopjans,” a term that negates “the ethnic identity of Macedonians and evokes Greece's horrific campaigns, past and present, at ethnically cleansing or forcibly assimilating its large Macedonian minority,” according to the Macedonian Human Rights Movement.

Karygiannis has also been an outspoken critic of the Venezuelan government. In an open letter in 2014, he called President Nicolas Maduro a “bully” and accused authorities of “shooting and hitting peaceful protesters.”
