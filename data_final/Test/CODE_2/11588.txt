Chicago teachers are staging a one-day strike on Friday, an effort aimed at moving stalled contract talks, pressuring Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner to end his budget standoff with the Democratic-controlled state legislature, and calling on lawmakers to fix the Illinois education funding formula, which has been cited as the nation’s most unfair to poor students.

The 27,000-member Chicago Teachers Union staged a one-week strike in 2012 that was largely supported by the city’s residents and that the union considered successful. Union President Karen Lewis said she hopes Friday’s walkout will pressure Rauner to stop his effort to win a budget that hits public education.

The Education Trust, a national advocacy group, found in a 2015 analysis that the highest-poverty schools receive about 20 percent fewer state and local dollars per pupil than schools in affluent communities — and that Illinois has the most unfair funding formula of any state.

In this post, a teacher who doesn’t work in Chicago looks at the one-day action there — and the very notion of whether teachers should ever go out on strike. He is Peter Greene, a veteran teacher of English in a small town in Pennsylvania. This appeared on his lively Curmudgucation blog, and I am republishing it with permission.

By Peter Greene

I have been through two strikes in my life.

The first was in Lorain, Ohio, in 1979, and it started about three days after I was hired. It was my first job, and the strike was ugly. The superintendent had been hired for his union-busting skills. My building rep and my principal both advised me to stay home and keep my head down. The whole thing lasted over six weeks, and it was a vicious mess. I emerged convinced that almost anything was preferable to a teacher strike.

The second was in Franklin, Pa., in 2002. I was the union president, and it was a contentious struggle. The board opened negotiations by stripping the contract, and its chief negotiator at one point said, “Yes, we have the money to give them a raise, but they don’t deserve it.” A couple of our union actions are on my “if I could take back parts of the past” list, but for the most part I thought both sides managed things reasonably well and the district emerged with minimal scarring. I don’t have that many years left in my career, and I fervently hope that I never have to go through a strike again.

So I absolutely recognize the anti-strike arguments put forth by two Chicago teachers in a Chicago Tribune commentary. I am not going to try to speak for the Chicago teachers’ union, but I can speak to why those two teachers are wrong and why, sometimes, teachers just have to take that kind of stand.

Their very first sentence is this:

Teaching is a personal mission, not a political one.

I understand their point, just as I understand them when they later write this:

When we think of speaking out and being heard, most of us don’t think about unions and politics. We think about what we need to do better to reach that child who misses too much school or struggles to read at grade level. We think about programs that we believe need to be implemented, supports that need to be in place. We want our principals to respect our assessments of what happens in our classrooms, we want our parents to understand that they need to be involved.

And I get that. The best teachers are absolutely clear that their primary mission is in their classroom, with their students. I have never encountered a strike or really any kind of teacher activism that did not evoke pleas such as, “But why do we have to get into politics? Can’t we just teach?”

I get that, too. There’s no question that unions sometimes get too interested in politics and make bad decisions out of strictly political calculus. The problem, however, is that we teachers can decide we’re done with politics — but politics is not done with us. Our work conditions, our pay, the very definition of our job and purpose — they are all politically decided these days.

I remember thinking early in my career — and hearing my members say during my second strike — that if we just spell out the facts and explain the truth, people will see what’s reasonable and do the right thing. Let’s return to the Chicago teachers’ op-ed:

If we want to be political, why not do so in a way that engages our communities, our politicians to truly hear what we have to say, that’s not at the expense of our children?

Why not? Because most of your politicians can already hear what you have to say. In the case of Chicago, does anybody really think that Mayor Rahm Emanuel just doesn’t hear the teachers? He hears them just fine.

Back to the commentary:

If we want to be political, and we are seeking more stability and funding for education, programming, schools and staff, why engage in a protest that further destabilizes, playing right into the hands of those looking for proof that the state must take over our schools and declare bankruptcy? Whom does that serve?

The “whom-does-this-serve” question is always the most important question teachers have to ask when contemplating a strike. Ultimately what you are weighing is the immediate needs of your current students against the needs of your students in the future. Teachers have a great tendency to be institutional enablers, trying to pick up the slack so that no children are hurt right now by bad policies or toxic leadership. While this is a noble impulse, it must be weighed against what will happen if the district gets no push-back on its bad policy and therefore continues to inflict it on thousands of students for years to come.

What any union has to ask is, “What role has proof played so far?” What willingness has the other side shown to listen to what the union, what the teachers, have to say?

Politics run on a sort of mean-testing basis. You say you want X. The people with power say, “How badly do you want it? Badly enough to whine about it? Because we can stand your whining for as long as you can stand to whine. Badly enough to make us sit through meetings? Because we can sit through meetings every day. Badly enough to inconvenience yourselves and us and the people who have our phone numbers? Badly enough to draw attention from the sleepy public? Because if you’re willing to go that far, then maybe we’ll think about giving you a piece of what you want just to make it stop.”

When the students of Boston public high schools walked out for a day recently and Boston officials decided to rethink budget cuts, it wasn’t because they suddenly slapped their foreheads and said, “Oh, we didn’t realize that budget cuts would actually cut peoples’ budgets.” They slapped their heads and said, “Oh, you actually care enough about this to make a real noise.”

Striking is the last thing you want to do as a teacher. It costs time and inconvenience, and invariably what gets lost is some of the noble heroic shine of someone who puts the students before everything else. It can bust up relationships, destabilize a staff, and make a real mess. Nobody wants to start a fight. But sometimes the fight comes to you, and your only choice is whether you will actually stand up for something. As Patrick Henry pointed out in his speech in the Virginia Convention, the war has already started. The only question is whether teachers will try to stand up or they will roll over and take their lumps.

Teachers strike to make a statement. That statement is generally some version of “these policies are not okay” or “we are done being ignored” or “better we suffer this small battle today than wait and be smashed apart tomorrow.” The Chicago twosome who wrote the commentary frame it as a choice of whether “to punitively turn away or work together to move forward” — but there are times when those are not the available choices.

I say it again: A teacher strike is my absolute last choice and there isn’t a thing I wouldn’t try first. But sometimes you reach a point where you have to recognize that the other party has no interest in solving problems together, but is only interested in pushing you as far as they can get you to go.

At some point you have to plant your feet and say, “This is enough. We have taken enough. This cannot go any further — not today, and definitely not for the children in the future. Somebody has to take a stand for our schools, our profession, and our present and future students. We have tried everything to work with you, but now we will make our stand.”

As a veteran of two multi-week strikes, I have to say that a one-day work stoppage seems like a pretty measured and relatively mild job action. I hope that the authorities in Illinois hear what the teachers have to say.
