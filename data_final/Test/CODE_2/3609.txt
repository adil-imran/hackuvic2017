GETTY The German government has accused Turkey of supporting ISIS

The document, produced by Angela Merkel’s Interior Ministry, claims president Erdogan’s government also supports Palestinian Hamas, Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood as well as other extremist groups in Syria. The damning report, seen by German media, said: “The many expressions of solidarity and support actions by the ruling AKP and president Erdogan for the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas and groups of armed Islamist opposition in Syria emphasise their ideological affinity with the broader Muslim Brotherhood.”

GETTY Tensions have boiled over between the two super powers

The revelation will send tensions between Germany and Ankara into meltdown following a series of spats in the wake of the failed military coup in Turkey last month. Hamas is an EU and US listed terrorist organisation and it is the first time Germany has made a link between the terror cell and Turkey. Ankara has also deepened its ties with the depraved groups and has become a “platform for action” in the region, according to the report.

The report adds: “As a result of the step-by-step Islamisation of its foreign and domestic policy since 2011, Turkey has become the central platform for action by Islamist groups in the Middle East.” Left-wing party Die Linke made the confidential request to the Bundestag, the German parliament, which was leaked to broadcaster ARD. Lawmaker and member of the party, Sevim Dagdalen, said: “The German government cannot publicly designate the godfather of terrorism Erdogan as a partner, while internally warning about Turkey as a hub for terrorism.”
