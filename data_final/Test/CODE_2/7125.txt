Anger: Thousands of steel workers have lost their jobs

Steel workers will be joined by their bosses as they march on ­Brussels demanding urgent action against cheap Chinese imports.

About 5,000 protesters will insist the European Commission ramps up tariffs on China to stop it dumping cut-price steel – one of the main reasons for thousands of job losses at Britain’s industry.

In an unprecedented move, reps from the Unite, Community and GMB unions will stand side by side with Tata Steel Europe chief Dr Karl-Ulrich Kohler and Celsa group’s boss Francisco Rubiralto.

Gareth Stace, director of trade association UK Steel, will also join the demo. He said: “I can’t remember an occasion where bosses have joined unions and employees to march on the European Union’s offices and demand more action.

Mr Stace said: “We’re bitterly ­disappointed the UK will not reconsider its opposition on ­scrapping the lesser duty rule.

“The UK Government must lead by example and ensure that swift and firm action is taken in Brussels.”
