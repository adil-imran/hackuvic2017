Ceasefire period

COMMONSENSE By Marichu A. Villanueva

Ten days from today, change will officially take place at Malacañang Palace. Doing away with some of the traditional formalities, the turnover rites from outgoing President Benigno “Noy” Aquino III to President-elect Rodrigo Duterte are reportedly cut to the barest minimum.

As he had promised during the campaign period, the incoming president will take his oath of office and inaugural in simple and austere rites at the Palace. Supreme Court associate justice Bienvenido Reyes will administer the oath of office of President Duterte as this column wrote last month.

But before taking his own oath, the outgoing Davao City mayor will first do his own turnover rites to daughter Sarah as the newly elected mayor of their city and son Paolo as her vice mayor.

Vice President Leni Robredo will have her own inaugural rituals at her home province in Camarines Sur. She will take her oath of office before a town barangay chairman as authorized under Republic Act 10755 that President Aquino signed last March 29.

Immediately after the inaugural rites, the new president convenes his first official Cabinet meeting at the Palace. The incoming president has yet to decide whether or not to appoint the vice president to a Cabinet post.

aAs of this writing, Duterte and Robredo have not met nor talked to each other yet. Robredo, along with her three daughters, flew to Taiwan last Friday for a family vacation. But President Aquino disclosed he and Duterte already talked with each other over telephone last week to congratulate and convey his willingness to extend his assistance, if asked.

It was during The STAR presidential candidate roundtable interview with him last May 6 when Duterte first intimated to us he would request either one of his two fraternity brothers and classmates at the San Beda College of Law Class 1972 to administer the oath of office at Malacañang.

The other frat brod of Duterte is SC senior associate justice Jose Mendoza. Unfortunately, Duterte noted his two brods are due to retire one after the other this year upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 70 years old. Reyes is retiring on July 6 while Mendoza on August 13. Duterte himself turned 71 last March.

Now that he is president, Duterte would be the appointing authority of ten vacancies at the SC during his next six years in office. This includes the two vacancies resulting from the scheduled retirement of Reyes and Mendoza.

Except for Reyes’ retirement, the other future vacancies at the SC are still far in the horizon. For now, President-elect Duterte has to complete his Cabinet. There is still no new secretary at the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the Cabinet-ranked head of the Metro Manila Development Authority.

Having served as prosecutor at the Davao City fiscal’s office for several years, Duterte recognizes the value of experience as a major qualification to become part of the 15-man bench in our so-called court of last resort. As one of the pillars of the criminal justice system, the SC’s role was underscored by Duterte in the fight to stamp out the social menace of crime and illegal drugs.

During the campaign, Duterte came under fire from his rivals and human rights groups with his public avowals to “kill all criminals.” This was his way, he explained during the same STAR roundtable with him, to send a very strong message and strike fear in the hearts of criminals and other evildoers.

It was Duterte’s battlecry during the campaign to step down from the presidency if he fails to deliver his promise to end the high crime incidence in three to six months.

Lately, however, President-elect Duterte obviously has kept out of the public his bad-temper and foul-mouthed image in these last few days before he assumes the highest office of the land. This was after he made a self-imposed “boycott” of press conferences, which he blamed taking many of his statements out of context.

Duterte entangled not just with his critics, women’s and human rights groups here in the country but also with his international audience.

No less than United Nations General Assembly secretary-general Ban Ki-moon came out with stinging remarks on the incoming President Duterte’s supposed statements that allegedly tended to incite further media killings in the Philippines.

The UN chief’s reaction was based unfortunately on some of the slanted reportage that came out in the international press. A case in point was the news dispatch from the Agence France Presse saying Duterte “endorsed killing of corrupt journalists.”

It was not actually a total boycott but the incoming president has opted to just make full use of the government-run People Television 4 network. He has since then issued his press statements only through PTV-4, which has exclusive coverage of all his presidential activities.

Incoming Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) secretary Martin Andanar told ANC in an interview last week Duterte’s decision to extend his boycott of the press throughout his term may be a wise decision. But that is an easy way out for this job that Duterte tasked to his communications team to do for him.

Andanar and the new PCOO team he is organizing must come up with a communications plan on how to best project Duterte’s resolve to confront the criminality, drug trafficking, corruption, traffic and other government programs to address issues and problems in our country.

Offhand, Andanar cited his proposal to make use of live-streaming from Facebook and other social media networks which Duterte’s handlers made full use during the presidential campaign. But isn’t that further widening the divide between mainstream media and President Duterte?

Once he assumes the presidency, Duterte earlier promised to dignify his office with the proper decorum of his language and acts. How would he do these tough acts without demeaning the presidency would indeed be a challenge in the next six years of his term as the “Mayor of the Philippines.”

Even the most bitter political enemies and critics during the campaign are willing to hold their peace and give the incoming president the chance to do the immediate tasks at hand. So his first six months at Malacañang will be a ceasefire period of sorts unilaterally given to President Duterte.
