NEW YORK, NY, Oct. 11, 2016 /CNW/ - The Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Status of Women, today celebrated International Day of the Girl at the United Nations by engaging with young women and girls who are activists for girls' rights and girls' equality on ways to create better and brighter futures for them and their peers around the world.

Minister Hajdu also highlighted Canada's renewed commitment to international engagement on gender equality issues, the empowerment of all women and girls, and the realization of their human rights during an address to the 71st session of the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly.

The Minister underscored a number of actions Canada is taking to make progress on gender equality. This includes the recent launch of a National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls which will respond to the unacceptable levels of violence perpetrated against them. The Minister also described her recent engagement of key stakeholders across Canada as part of the government's plan to develop a Federal Strategy Against Gender-based Violence. In social policy, the federal government is currently developing a Framework for Early Education and Childcare, along with a Poverty Reduction Strategy, both of which will support the needs of many women and their families.

Canada has committed to placing gender equality and rights, and the empowerment of women and girls at the heart of all its international development efforts. These priorities reflect the fact that in many countries, when women and girls are empowered with the knowledge and skills to succeed in life, they have better health and economic outcomes. Girls are also powerful agents of change and need to be included as full participants in decisions that affect their lives, including in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Quick Facts

Earlier this year, Canada was elected as a member of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (UNCSW) for the 2017 to 2021 term. Established in 1946, the UNCSW is the principal global intergovernmental body exclusively dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been selected as a 'champion' of UN Women's HeForShe campaign, a solidarity movement that calls upon men and boys to stand up against the persistent inequalities faced by women and girls globally. He also serves as youth ambassador for HeforShe, advocating for gender equality and the full support and involvement of youth around the world.



Quote

"We know how difficult it is to overcome entrenched gender inequality, especially when a culture of patriarchy persists in a society. The pace of change in gender roles and social norms can be far too slow and sometimes painful, because power and privilege are never easily relinquished. All women and girls deserve an equal chance to realize their human rights, reach their full potential, and contribute to and benefit from the progress in their communities and countries. The Government of Canada is committed to working with all of our partners to make this happen."
