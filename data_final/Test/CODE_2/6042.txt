MANILA, Philippines - The military has ordered all field units to intensify intelligence gathering operations nationwide to derail any plot by lawless groups to disrupt the commemoration of All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day.

Millions will troop to cemeteries to pray for their departed loved ones on Nov. 1 and Nov. 2.

“All unified commands, the Joint Task Force NCR (JTF-NCR) and major service commanders are under orders to intensify intelligence and security operations, in coordination with the Philippine National Police (PNP), during All Saints’ and All Souls’ Day celebrations,” said AFP chief Gen. Ricardo Visaya.

Visaya also placed the Army, Air Force and Navy under high alert status as part of security preparations.

He said that military units have to actively coordinate with their PNP counterparts through the Joint Peace and Security Coordinating Council (JPSCC) to stop all possible threats during the holidays.

The JPSCC is a mechanism for joint operations with the police to address various security concerns.

“Vigilance and profiling of threat groups will be an edge of our security forces. Criminal and terrorist groups may take advantage of the gathering of people in bus terminals, air and seaports. We will keep an eye on other places of convergence like cemeteries, especially during this long weekend,” Visaya said.

In key cities across the country, unified commands and the JTF-NCR, together with their counterparts in the police, would employ measures to secure public facilities and other vital establishments.

Visaya directed the Army, Air Force and Navy to remain on alert and be ready to deploy additional troops to support the unified command operations.

Checkpoints would be set up in critical areas, complemented by the deployment of K9 and Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams.

The JTF-NCR will provide assistance to motorists at the South Luzon Expressway and North Luzon Expressway.

Interior Secretary Ismael Sueno has reminded local officials to come up with their respective contingency plans on peace and order and public safety for the commemoration of All Saints’ Day next week.

“Undas is an important Filipino tradition. The department calls on mayors to convene their respective local peace and order councils to formulate a contingency plan on peace and order and public safety,” Sueno said.

He urged local officials to deploy law enforcers, barangay tanods and medical personnel in public and private cemeteries and memorial parks to assist those who will visit their loved ones starting today until Tuesday.

Sueno also ordered the deployment of additional enforcers to assist motorists and intensify the effective traffic management, especial near cemeteries.

The intelligence units of the National Capital Region Police Office did not monitor any terrorist threat in the metropolis as NCRPO director Chief Supt. Oscar Albayalde started deploying personnel yesterday in 99 cemeteries and other areas in Metro Manila.

“Our intelligence agents monitored no threat by any terrorist groups in Metro Manila during All Saints’ Day,” said Albayalde as he declared that the 19,000-strong NCRPO was placed on full alert to secure the public during the occasion.

Albayalde said police assistance desks were set up yesterday in cemeteries, bus terminals, airports and seaports to prevent petty criminals from taking advantage of the situation.

“We urge the public to report to policemen manning our PADs any problem they encounter, especially on criminality, as they are very willing to respond the minute they report any incident,” said Albayalde.

The Department of Transportation activated “Oplan Ligtas Biyahe: Undas 2016” amid an expected influx of passengers for the holidays.

The department said it has directed all attached agencies to be on heightened alert status to guarantee the security and safety of passengers traveling during the Undas period.

To ensure the roadworthiness of buses, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) is conducting an inspection of the vehicles.

LTFRB is also issuing special permits to bus operators valid from today until Nov. 3, as more buses are needed to carry those going to the provinces.

The Land Transportation Office, meanwhile, has been directed to enhance public assistance programs to guide motorists.

As for the Toll Regulatory Board, it will be deploying additional personnel at toll plazas where traffic build-up is expected.

For its part, the Manila International Airport Authority has created a team composed of airport managers to oversee the operations of the airport during the peak days.

The Philippine National Railways will maintain the present number of train trips in the Metro Manila South Commuter and Bicol Commuter Services.

Red Cross deployed

The Philippine Red Cross (PRC) deployed at least 1,500 staff and volunteers to man 295 first aid stations in 243 cemeteries nationwide during the observance of the All Saints’ Day.

Aside from the cemeteries, the PRC will also be setting up first aid posts along main highways such as North Luzon Expressway, South Luzon Expressway and Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway (TPLEX).

PRC chairman Sen. Richard Gordon said 61 ambulances would be on major highways to secure travelers to the provinces.

“This is the time of the year when families gather to remember their departed loved ones. So our goal at the PRC is to keep our fellow Filipinos safe at all times and give them the best assistance they need,” said Gordon.

The PRC advised the public to wear light colored clothing, bring water and avoid consuming alcoholic drinks.

Parents are likewise advised not to bring children to cemeteries and other crowded places to avoid health hazards.

Meanwhile, military and police security forces defused an improvised explosive device (IED) and foiled the bombing attempt of suspected Abu Sayyaf last Friday in Isabela City, Basilan, according to police officials.

Isabela City police chief Supt. Jerome Afuyug said a resident discovered the IED near the gate of the house of Soler Undug, district engineer of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), in Barangay San Rafael.

Explosive ordnance and disposal units immediately defused the IED made up of a pipe bomb with a mobile phone that could be used as triggering device. The bomb was wrapped in red and black plastic. With Janvic Mateo, Non Alquitran, Roel Pareño
