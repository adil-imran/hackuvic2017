Thailand to extradite human traffickers

PUTRAJAYA • Thailand has agreed to Malaysia's request to extradite 10 Thai nationals believed to be masterminds in human trafficking cases along the Malaysia-Thailand border, said Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi.

The 10 individuals, aged between 35 and 60, are involved in the trafficking of Rohingya and Bangladeshi nationals, whose remains were found in mass graves on both sides of the border in May last year, Datuk Seri Zahid said on Monday.

Seoul picks 3 new possible Thaad sites

SEOUL • South Korea has picked three alternative sites in the rural Seongju county for the deployment of a US Terminal High- Altitude Area Defence (Thaad) anti-missile shield, after its first choice was criticised for being too close to a residential area.

The three alternatives are the Lotte Skyhill Seongju Country Club, Mount Yeomsok and Mount Kkachi, The Korea Times reported on Monday.

South Korea wants to host Thaad amid a growing missile threat from North Korea, despite protests at home.
