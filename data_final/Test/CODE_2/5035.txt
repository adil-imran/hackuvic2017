War prisoners languish in Ukraine conflict

KIEV, Ukraine — Just three days after Ukrainian soldier Oleksandr Lazarenko was taken prisoner in the war in Ukraine’s east, a peace agreement was signed under which the sides agreed to an “all-for-all” prisoner exchange. A year and a half later, his wife still waits desperately for his return.

The Minsk Agreement on ending the war between Russia-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces is floundering on many issues, but prisoner releases appear to be one of the most intractable.

Amnesty International and Human Rights watch allege both sides have arbitrarily detained civilians, sometimes holding them incommunicado for months in prisons that authorities don’t acknowledge exist.

The sides cite widely varying figures for how many prisoners they’re holding. Both appear to be holding the issue over the other’s head to force concessions on other topics, which include having elections in Ukraine’s separatist region and restoring Ukraine’s full control over its border with Russia.

“Our expectations have been thwarted by politicians’ plans,” said Lazarenko’s wife, Natalya. “After Minsk, the prisoners became an instrument of political trading.”

Even that frustration and anxiety is something of an improvement. For three months after her husband was seized, she had no information on whether he was dead or alive.

Lazarenko was captured by a Cossack formation that was not under the rebels’ control. Eventually, he and 12 others were found by the rebel government’s Committee on POWs and transferred to a detention facility in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, the rebels’ main stronghold.

Finally allowed to call his wife, Lazarenko said the Cossacks had held him in a windowless basement where he could only lie down on sacks of potatoes. He told her that he and the other prisoners were beaten and fed scraps.

Although the numbers held by each side are in dispute, it’s clear that the pace of releases has slowed markedly for Ukrainians held by the rebels. Since the Minsk agreement was signed in February 2015, 83 Ukrainian prisoners have been released, but only 12 of them were freed this year.

Rebel officials said last month they had reached a tentative agreement with Ukraine to release 47 prisoners, in exchange for Ukraine freeing 618.

Who those 618 might be is uncertain. Rebel military spokesman Eduard Basurin said Ukraine is holding 962 easterners, of whom 316 are fighters and the rest are either political prisoners or civilians with no connection to the conflict. Ukraine says it is holding about 500 people in connection with the war.
