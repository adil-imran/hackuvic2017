She's a household name now thanks to Fox's Empire.

But Taraji P. Henson still has an axe to grind about the way Hollywood has treated her.

In her new memoir Around The Way Girl, the actress, 46, reveals that a part written for her in the 2014 film St. Vincent was handed to Naomi Watts to play instead.

Sharing her story: Taraji P. Henson, pictured outside the GMA studios in New York on Tuesday, has written a memoir and she's not pulling any punches when it comes to telling it like it is

'It was a meaty gig,' she said of the role of a Russian stripper she claims was written especially for her by screenwriter and director Theodore Melfi.

'I would have loved it. Alas, I couldn’t get served at that particular restaurant,' she wrote in an excerpt obtained by USA Today.

Henson went on: ' Time and again, I’ve lost roles because someone with the ability to green-light a film couldn’t see black women beyond a very limited purview he or she thought ‘fit’ audience expectations.'

Losing out as a black actress: Henson, 46, revealed that the role of a Russian stripper written for her in the 2014 film St. Vincent was given instead to Naomi Watts

Hit: Watts starred in the Bill Murray film with Melissa McCarthy and Jaeden Lieberher. It was written and directed by Theodore Melfi

Aired grievances: She also griped that she was paid 'the equivalent of sofa change' compared to Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, her co-stars in The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button

It's not only how she's treated in the casting process that draws her ire but also how she's been paid too.

Henson was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for her role as Queenie in the 2008 Brad Pitt film The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button.

She writes that her salary was in 'the lowest of six figures' and 'the equivalent of sofa change' compared to the salaries of her co-stars Pitt and Cate Blanchett.

Not only that, she also had to foot her own hotel bill during filming, she said.

Henson has shared her life story in the memoir Around The Way Girl, documenting how she went from a single mom in college to a Hollywood actress. She's pictured on The Tonight Show

Appearing on GMA Tuesday, the actress spoke about why she decided to share her story, warts and all, with the public.

'If my life experiences can help someone else in life, why not?' she said.

'That’s what we’re here for as humans. We make the world go ‘round. We inspire each other as humans. I can’t even tell you how many stories I look at that keep inspiring me to get up every day and fighting the good fight.'

She was a college junior age 24 when she fell pregnant with her son Marcel by her childhood sweetheart. But the relationship became abusive and she split from the father of her child, who died in 2003.

Despite being a single mom, she graduated college and moved to LA to pursue an acting career.

Her break came when she was cast opposite Tyrese Gibson in 2001's Baby Boy, followed by her standout performance as Terrence Howard's love interest in 2005's Hustle & Flow.
