LAHORE - A Kuala Lumpur-bound PIA flight yesterday landed at the Lahore airport after being denied overflight rights by Indian authorities. The PK-894 flight had left Peshawar airport for Malaysia.

A PIA’s spokesman late yesterday night said that the flight left for Kuala Lumpur after refuelling.

He also clarified that the flight did not face any kind of resistance.

The spokesman claimed that the flight was called back because of weight conditions.

Earlier, aviation sources said the pilots diverted the flight back to Pakistan after being denied air-space by New Delhi. When a pilot asked the reason, the Indian air traffic control did not mention any justification for denying air space to the Pakistani flight.

Reportedly, this PIA’s flight uses the Indian air space as usual but yesterday it was denied the airspace without any prior warning. Pakistani officials immediately contacted their Indian counterparts by using Hot-Line but the Indian authorities did not respond to their calls.

According to the international laws, the concerned authorities are bound to give prior information to the flights in case of any problem related to the air-space use.

However, Indian authorities without prior information denied the air space to a Pakistani flight. The airline ultimately was called back and it safely landed at the Lahore international airport yesterday evening.

Diplomatic relations between New Delhi and Islamabad are at their lowest ebb amid Kashmir flare-up.

In 2001, India and Pakistan had slapped a ban on each other’s air space.

India had banned PIA overflight rights over its air space, which prompted Pakistan banning Indian planes from using Pakistani airspace.

The national flag carriers of both - Air India and Pakistan International Airlines – had to use the international waters to reach their destinations as an alternative flight-path option.

Aviation experts say ban on airspace could cause financial losses to both countries. The Indian decision is astonishing since no airline in either country can afford the financial losses, accruing from a ban on using each other's air space. “New Delhi has again violated the International Charter of Civil Aviation just to create financial problems for Pakistan international airline," an expert said.
