CEBU, Philippines - A more sustainable way for the government to generate revenues is to have more businesses and individuals registered as taxpayers, said the president of the Philippine Institute of Public Accountants (PICPA)-Cebu Chapter.

In an interview with The FREEMAN on Saturday, Dr. Edgar Detoya, who is also Dean of the College of Commerce at the University of San Jose-Recoletos, said the government's serious plan to cut down income tax rates is generally good for the economy in the long-run.

"Revenues should not come from high tax rates. If we lower down our tax rates, we invite more businesses to start and workers will have more spending power," Detoya said.

The PICPA official stressed that tax is a big part of the cost of doing business and that lowering corporate income tax is essentially good for both starting and existing corporations.

Reform

Late last month, the Department of Finance finally submitted to Congress the first package of the Duterte government's tax reform program designed to lower personal income tax rates while raising revenues to help fund the administration's 10-point socioeconomic agenda.

The personal income tax reform package will be followed by the submission of the corporate income tax package, property tax package and capital income tax package.

Topping DOF's tax reform proposals are the restructuring of the personal income tax (PIT) system; expansion of the value-added tax base by reducing the coverage of its exemptions; adjustment of excise taxes imposed on petroleum products; and restructuring the excise tax on automobiles except for buses, trucks, cargo vans and jeepneys.

The PIT reforms include the adjustments in the income tax brackets; reducing the personal income tax maximum rate over time to 25 percent from 32 percent at present, except for highest income earners; and shift to a simpler, modified gross system.

Income tax rates in the Philippines are considered among the highest in Southeast Asia, making it less attractive for foreign investors to invest in the country.

Investments

The DOF said the comprehensive tax reform package that includes other measures will also augment the P1 trillion in investments needed to transform the country into a high-income economy in one generation or by 2040.

Detoya said the tax reform will bring in new investments as prospective investors largely consider the tax system, among other factors, before putting up their businesses.

In particular, the plan to cut down corporate income tax rate to 25 percent from 30 percent at present will be offset by streamlining the tax incentives granted to companies.

The government's plans to massively hike investments in infrastructure, human capital and social protection would require robust revenue inflows.

Thus, it is also looking to raise more revenues, as part of the reform.

According to DOF, the proposed tax reforms would cumulatively generate a net revenue gain of P368.1 billion by 2019 if these are passed by the Congress.

Part of the reforms sought would be that lower estate and donor's taxes will be made up for by increased property valuation rates to raise more funds for local governments.

The DOF has said any revenue-eroding proposal would be offset by new or additional sources of taxes.

Detoya said the reform program should also include measures to boost revenue collection and efficiency in collection. (FREEMAN)
