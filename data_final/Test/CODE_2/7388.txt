LAHORE - The Lahore High Court chief justice yesterday constituted a larger bench for hearing of a petition challenging out-of-turn promotions in the high court establishment.



The larger bench headed by Chief Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and comprising Justice Yawar Ali, Justice Abid Aziz Sheikh, Justice Ayesha A.

Malik and Justice Faisal Zaman Khan would take up the matter on October 28.



LHC deputy registrar Akmal Khan being aggrieved of his own suspension filed the petition against the court establishment for out-of-turn promotions.

He was suspended on August 17, 2016.



The suspended official said that he was subjected to vindictive action for highlighting alleged corruption, out-of-turn promotions and illegal appointments in the court.

The petitioner pointed out that though he was suspended on the grounds of ‘poor’ performance, his name was recommended for honorarium over dedication with official work.



The petitioner said that at least five officials of the LHC establishment including chairman of Committee of Management of the LHC were promoted out of turn.



He further submitted that some other officials were suspended on same grounds and manner but they were later reinstated and posted on key posts.

He said Additional Registrar (IT) Saima Mushtaq and Deputy Registrar (IT) Iftikhar Ahmed were suspended on Sept 19, 2016 for being inefficient.

However, he said, both were reinstated after few days and awarded more responsibilities.

He said he was not reinstated.

The counsel prayed the court to set aside his suspension order and reinstate him.

He further prayed the court to order audit of the LHC welfare fund.



LHC SEEKS REPLY FROM PBC

The Lahore High Court yesterday sought reply again from Pakistan Bar Council in a petition challenging Punjab University for issuing equivalent certificates to the students for their admission in post-graduation programs.



Wajid Ali, a student, had filed the petition through his counsel Advocate Sheraz Zaka and submitted that the Punjab University had opened an equivalence department for issuance of equivalent certificates to the students.

A law officer on behalf of Pakistan Bar Council appeared in the court and said that the only council had the powers to recognize the degrees of law graduates and not the varsity.

He sought time to submit reply in detail.

At this, the court gave him time and put off further hearing until Nov 15.



Previously, the council of the Punjab University had told the court that the varsity had the powers to recognize the degrees.



The petitioner through his counsel Advocate Sheraz Zaka had submitted that the powers of issuing equivalent certificates and powers of recognition vest with Higher Education Commission and Pakistan Bar Council.

He had said that the varsity was exceeding its powers regarding this issue.

He had prayed the court to bar the varsity from issuing equivalent certificates.
