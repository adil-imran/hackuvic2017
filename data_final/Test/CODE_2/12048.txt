Learners protested yesterday over the Cape Town school's policies on hair and language.

CAPE TOWN - Former and current Sans Souci Girls' High School learners are planning to hand over a memorandum of grievances to the school's management today.

Dozens of learners protested at the school yesterday over its code of conduct, specifically its policy on hair and language.

The pupils say they decided to speak out as some feel they are being discriminated against. "I had to relax my hair because if it's natural it's going to be a problem," a learner said.

The demonstrators have organised themselves under the banner 'The Truth We Will Proclaim', which is taken from the school's motto.

They want the school's code of conduct rewritten and more transformation within the governing body and staff.

One learner says the school's code of conduct and language policy does not accommodate all learners. Another learner has questioned why Xhosa-speaking learners can't speak their home language at school.

"Being white and other teachers being white, if teachers can speak Afrikaans because that's their home language then why can't the Xhosa people also speak their home language?"

The school's governing body is expected to hold a meeting with parents and learners next week.
