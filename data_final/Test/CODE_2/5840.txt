PRIME Minister Malcolm Turnbull has refused to answer questions about whether Tony Abbott was engaging in ‘sniping’, after Christopher Pyne admitted a deal on guns was made.

When asked if he believed that Mr Abbott has kept his commitment not to engage in sniping which he made after losing the prime ministership to Mr Turnbull, the PM avoided the issue altogether.

“Well, I’m not going to, ah... I’m very happy to deal with the facts.

“I’m not going to run a commentary on, ah, on any, ah, other members of parliament. So, if you have questions about the facts, I think I’ve described the facts fairly, and the history. If you’ve got any other questions on the facts, I’m happy to entertain them,” he said.

Mr Turnbull also faced more questions today about whether Mr Abbott had misled parliament yesterday over his version of what happened with an agreement on gun laws and the import ban on action-lever shotguns.

Mr Turnbull was adamant he had already addressed this yesterday, telling reporters: “In August of last year, the Abbott Government imposed an import ban on lever-action shotguns with more than five rounds. This is the Adler 7-shot lever-action shotgun. In September of last year, the Abbott Government varied that ban to impose a sunset clause so that the ban ran for 12 months. When that sunset clause was coming close to its, um, conclusion in August of this year, I brought the matter to my Cabinet and we resolved — that’s to say, the Turnbull Government resolved — to continue the import ban indefinitely. Now, all of these — so there has been — the Abbott Government was committed to banning the importation of the shotgun, the Turnbull Government was committed to banning the importation of the shotgun.”

Mr Turnbull said the ban “has always been expressed to be temporary in the sense that we are awaiting the agreement of state and territory police ministers to the reclassification of these weapons” under the 1996 National Firearms Agreement.

“Everybody agrees that the classifications should be strengthened from where they are at the moment.”

A national gun amnesty will be launched next year to get illegal firearms off the streets reported the Herald Sun.

Federal Justice Minister Michael Keenan said the states agreed on the amnesty during a COAG meeting in Melbourne this afternoon.

Mr Turnbull’s comments come after Christopher Pyne denied Mr Turnbull effectively called Mr Abbott a liar on the floor of federal parliament as the political battle over gun laws continues.

But Mr Pyne did admit there was a “deal” struck to put in place a sunset clause on a temporary ban of the seven-shot Adler lever-action shotgun in July 2015 ahead of a meeting with the states on Friday.

Despite Mr Turnbull yesterday telling parliament he was satisfied Justice Minister Michael Keenan acted in the full knowledge of the former prime minister’s office in striking the deal, Mr Pyne told the Nine Network it was “not true” Mr Turnbull had effectively called Mr Abbott a liar, after he denied there was a deal.

Mr Pyne denied there was a deal to water down the Howard government’s gun laws.

But there certainly was a deal to put in a sunset clause on the temporary Adler ban.

Mr Abbott on Wednesday told the ABC there was “no deal” struck with Liberal Democrat David Leyonhjelm by his office in exchange for support for government legislation.

Asked if he accepted that Mr Abbott didn’t know about the agreement reached with ministers Michael Keenan and Peter Dutton, Mr Pyne said: “I don’t know what was in his mind or not at the time”.

“But I can tell you one thing — there is no fissure between Malcolm Turnbull and Tony Abbott over the fact that we will not water down John Howard’s gun laws.”

He denied Mr Turnbull and Mr Abbott despised each other, citing Mr Abbott’s repeated statements he wants the Turnbull government to win the next election.

Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese said if there were any entrepreneurs in the modern Liberal Party they’d be selling popcorn outside the lower house.

“This was a cage-fight on national television on the floor of the House of Representatives,” he said.

“It’s on, it’s on out there for all to see and it is all of Malcolm Turnbull’s own making, because he was incapable of giving an answer to a pretty clear question on Tuesday about the guns for votes deal.”

Abbott reneged on gun deal 'clarification' 2:04 Sky News understands Tony Abbott reneged on a deal to clarify a row with Malcolm Turnbull in parliament.

Cabinet minister Josh Frydenberg described the debate as a “GBD — a Great Big Distraction”.

“We were getting traction in parliament yesterday on the Australian Building and Construction Commission bills, which will be an important cop on the beat,” he told ABC TV.

Mr Frydenberg said he hates all guns, but acknowledged a lot of people use them for commercial reasons, such as on their farms.

“But the less guns in our community, the better. Just the other day, I was watching on television the movie Bowling for Columbine, that terrible story about the killing of young people.”

Parliamentary intelligence and security committee chair Michael Sukkar accused the media of being distracted by trivialities.

“I don’t think there was strong evidence there was horse-trading going on,” he told ABC radio.

Asked if people should believe Mr Turnbull or Mr Abbott’s versions of events, he said all the positions could be “quite easily reconciled”.
