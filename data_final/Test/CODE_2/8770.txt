ODM leader Raila Odinga

Opposition leaders yesterday launched a scathing attack on the Jubilee administration over the reported Sh5 billion scam in the Ministry of Health. The leaders sought to place the blame right on the lap of the President; demanding decisive action and/or resignations of top public officers named in the scandal.

Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD) co-principals Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka and Moses Wetang'ula, and ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi separately called on President Uhuru Kenyatta to dissolve his government, accusing the Jubilee administration of either being unwilling or unable to fight corruption.

In a press briefing yesterday at his Capitol Hill office, Raila sensationally claimed that the scam at Afya House involved individuals in President Kenyatta's social circles.

"We are getting a feeling that President Uhuru Kenyatta is not as innocent as he has tried to portray himself in public in the massive theft crippling the country," he said.

He said the President cannot claim to know nothing about these individuals, while Kenyans know who these people are to the President.

Odinga said it had emerged that one the companies mentioned, Estama Limited, which was paid to provide 100 container clinics with supplies worth Sh1million for each container, never provided these supplies; he said this company was associated with people around the Presidency.

The opposition leader went ahead to name those behind the companies. The Standard on Saturday could, however, not independently verify the ownership of some of the firms and names tabled by the former Prime Minister.

The former Premier mentioned Life Care Medic, which was paid Sh201 million, as being associated with Richard Ngatia and Paul Ndungu. Both Ndung'u and Ngatia, while acknowledging ownership of the firm, dismissed claims that they had not provided supplies.

The duo said the contract awarded to their firm was fully delivered according to the contractual agreement and that the firm had met all its tax obligations.

The former premier said: "Is the President silent on this and the many other thefts in the country because of this conflicted position? Is he giving up on the war against corruption because it has now entered his own inner sanctum? We have reasons to believe so," Odinga claimed.

Former Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka said the opposition would not relent until heads roll at the ministry.

"It is heart-rending that this has become the norm. It (corruption) has become a daily affair. Kenyans are seriously hurting from this pilferage of tax payers' money by the Jubilee government. And what is worse? Uhuru has thrown up his hands," said Kalonzo.
