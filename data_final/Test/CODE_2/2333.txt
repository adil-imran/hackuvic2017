Conservatives Should Worry: Democrat Senator Says Progressive Supreme Court Top Goal

Sen. Chuck Schumer has reminded us just how important the upcoming presidential election will be in shaping the federal judiciary, calling getting a progressive Supreme Court his number one goal.



A progressive majority on the Supreme Court is an imperative, and if I become majority leader, I will make it happen, Schumer, D-N.Y., said to attendees at a conference last week hosted by the Rev. Al Sharpton.



These statements should concern individuals with a proper understanding of the limited role of the judiciary. The next president will appoint at least one justice to the Supreme Court and could fill one-third of judgeships on the lower courts by the end of two terms.



And a progressive Supreme Court is not outside the realm of possibilities.

If his queen is also elected IMHO we will never be allowed to purchase a firearm again in America, and our sovereignty will be turned over to the U.N. one more time when Queen and Schumer ensure the ratification of the UN Small Arms Treaty (which JFK/'B Insane O' have already signed).

A Schumer Senate MUST be defeated, no matter how much I think McConnell is the most useless GOPee in Congress.If his queen is also elected IMHO we will never be allowed to purchase a firearm again in America, and our sovereignty will be turned over to the U.N. one more time when Queen and Schumer ensure the ratification of the UN Small Arms Treaty (which JFK/'B Insane O' have already signed).

Tyranny through an un-elected body is their goal. Start ignoring their diktats; it’s going to happen sooner or later.

He should learn from history. Much like the Salem witch trials, or the French Revolution, what they begin will ultimately turn on them.

If the GOP wins the Senate, won’t the members vote on who will be the new Senate Majority Leader? If so why can’t they just vote McConnell OUT?

If Hillary gets another lefty on the SCOTUS, the 1st and 2nd amds are going to be reinterpreted 180* opposite their intent. 1st amd: “No shouting fire in a theater.” If you provoke violence by your words, you will be held liable. Laws against “inflammatory speech” will be passed and found constitutional. What is “inflammatory speech?” Anything that provokes a 3rd party to violence. IOW, it was Charlie Hebdo’s fault they were massacred. They “triggered” the Moslem attack. Ergo, other Charlie Hebdos must be outlawed. Truth is not a valid defense. Sharia “blasphemy” standards don’t care about truth. If you write that Mohammed was a mass-murderer and pedophile (quoting from the Koran and Hadith), you are still blaspheming. IOW, truthful speech about Islam will be outlawed under the new interpretation of the 1st Amd. We know Hillary supports this, because she urged Congress to ratify UN Res. 16/18, a “Sharia standard” for “free speech.” 2nd Amd: The meaning of “militia” has now “evolved” to mean the national guard and other recognized official reserve units. Ergo, there is no longer an individual right for private persons to own firearms. States can outlaw any weapons that “are capable of holding a magazine containing more than five rounds” if they so choose, and this law will be upheld as constitutional by Hillary’s SCOTUS.

There is an interesting fiction book by Larry Burkett, Christian author, called “The Illuminati” where the president has all of the U.S. Supreme Court Justices who would vote against his power takeover moves assassinated. Larry states in the beginning of the book that it is total fiction and he has no gift of prophesy. The book has been around for many years and it gives a fictional account of the events surrounding the collapse of our government and financial system. Irony as on goodreads.com the Illuminati has 666 ratings!!! Per Google:

Written in 1991, staged as 2001 events.

The year is 2001 and the world is on the brink of economic collapse as the Illuminati, a deadly secret organization, succeeds in placing one of their people in the office of the presidency of the United States, gaining control of world events. Have John Elder and Randy Cross read the “signs of the times” soon enough to expose the Illuminati and thwart their diabolical plan? Or will this organization and its leaders be hailed as the world’s political saviors?

Book review if Illuminati There is an updated version from 2004. It is the original book, but with updated times, people, etc. Instead of it all happening in 2001, it’s 2015. It’s a christian book and a very good read. When I started it less than a week ago, the first few pages didn’t quite grab me. But when the earthquake in Japan happened, and the tsunami on the west coast, it caught my attention. It just got better and better from there. The conspiracy to eradicate the christians and the jews and anyone that helped them is all very scary. A government gone mad and wanting to take over the world. Hey, that sounds a lot like what is going on now in Congress. ;) It really makes you think and you may never feel the same way about the government again after reading this. (review written in 2012)

As a Proud Member of The Vast Right Wing Deplorables and aware that the Supremes put their pant on one leg at a time.....they, unlike Hillary, are not above the law...Justices who continue to rule with Social Justice will be retired from that court. The future of our Supreme Court will be run by the rule of law and the U.S. Constitution....

Schmucky is no McConnell. He will pull out all the stops and deploy the nuclear option, every time. If republican control survives, McMilquetoast needs to do stiffen his spine.

Photos show that Chuckie was RIGHT NEXT TO HILLARY at Ground Zero when her nurse/doctor was giving her neurological tests. Shame on this traitorous bastard. Where are the patriotic Democrats who love country more than themselves? They don’t exist!! Chuck is in it for CHUCK!!! Even to the point of propping up a seriously ill and demented greedy power-hungry old lady past her due date!

Nine unelected political appointees should not be the final word on what our rights as American citizens are. Especially since the recent appointees have been more concerned with enforcing the ideology of the person that appointed them than they are of examining laws as to their constitutionality. To put it simply, the SCOTUS was supposed to be the branch of government the founders created to protect us from the consequences of our electing bad politicians. One can argue about when it was that the SCOTUS changed from what it was meant to be to what it is, but clearly, what it has become is NOT what the founders envisioned and our freedoms as Americans are in peril from them as surely as we are from bad choices at the voting booth. I sincerely hope we can begin to turn the tide with this upcoming election because the ever increasing intrusions on our personal freedoms are rapidly becoming intolerable. I’ve mentioned in several comments before that I will consent to being governed but I will refuse to be ruled. Well, we’re rapidly approaching the point where they’ve pushed about as far as I’m willing to let them. That includes allowing my rights as an American citizen to be determined by 9 black robed political appointees on the Supreme court telling me that their interpretation of the Bill of Rights is so fundamentally different than mine. There’s a lot more I’d like to say but something is telling me I should stop here, for now.

The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure," Jefferson wrote in a letter to William S. Smith, a diplomatic official in London, on November 13, 1787.

Yep. We all know laws are no longer made by the legislature. It is ruled on by black robed tyrants.

I am so disgusted. I see no patriots, Dem or Republican. You know, it is pretty hard to swallow being a working stiff in this country who gets no vacation while the elite go on ripping off the public fisc the way they do.It almost makes you look for another country to live in. The “American Way” is not worth it anymore!!!
