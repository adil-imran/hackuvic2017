Networks Hyped Perry Indictment in 2014; Silent on Dismissal

NewsBusters ^ | February 25, 2016 | Mike Ciandella

Posted on by Republican Wildcat

Political scandals make for juicy journalism, but apparently a politician being cleared of wrongdoing isnt even worth a mention.

When the initial story of Rick Perrys indictment broke in August 2014, ABC, CBS and NBC eagerly devoted 25 minutes in just two days to topic, speculating that the controversy could end any chance for Perry in 2016. But when Perry was cleared of any wrongdoing on Wednesday, all three networks were silent, on both the evening news shows that night and the morning news shows the following day, Thursday, February 25..

[However, with their similarly half-hour-long evening news broadcast, Univision's Noticiero Univision managed to give Perry's exoneration 20 seconds on Wednesday night.]

The indictment came after then-Governor Perry vetoed funding for a public integrity unit after the District Attorney in charge of the unit refused to resign after a drunk driving conviction.

In a front page article from August 16, 2014, The New York Times claimed that [t]he incident could mar the legacy of Mr. Perry, the longest-serving governor of Texas, calling it a major roadblock to his presidential ambitions.

On NBCs Today, Lester Holt (now the anchor of NBC Nightly News after the departure of Brian Williams), asked viewers if Perry trying to strong arm a political rival could end any chance of a White House run in 2016.

On February 24 of this year, a Texas appeals court threw out the case against former Texas Governor Rick Perry, saying that the charge violated the Texas Constitutions separation of powers provision by improperly limiting the governors veto authority.

Since Perry opposed the wall and favored in-state tuition for illegals, I’m happy about this.

Yeah, funny about that... I read about it in the WSJ. Otherwise, I honestly wouldn’t have known it had happened.

Nice to hear that Trump supporters are just as dishonest and low as the worst of the American Left really makes me feel good about the man and his supporters I think you should take that back, and qualify it, or I'll report your post #5 as abuse.

The comment I responded to said volumes in that unfair disingenuous and dishonest treatment of political opponents by the press is a okay. If the moderators wish to censor me in some way for saying so that is there perogative and reporting it is yours, as with all things do what you think is best



To: Bidimus1

A very salient point, it shows nicely what happens when Republican Party allows NON Republicans to run at the top of tickets.

ONE guy made a comment and you use the word “supporters”? Oh I get it, that ONE Trump Supporter making a comment is just like a Cockroach. You see one, there must be hundreds. You should have waited for a few more to pile on before making your accusation. Then you might have a leg to stand on. Don’t really care, it’s just silly IMHO. Carry on.

You’re correct I exaggerated I was acting like trump there for a a bit. I’m sure there must be people of good character who support the man and do not agree with the press intentionally misrepresenting the case against Governor Perry was a good thing to them I apologize.



To: Bidimus1

Funny how the last of the charges against Perry were dropped and not a word from the Press. I only heard one snippet somewhere and that was it. Only the people that even care about Politics would even know about, but the uninformed Public that was force fed the information when the Perry Indictment was handed down still think Perry was convicted of “something”. The Media is the enemy, period.
