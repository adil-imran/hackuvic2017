Tostee has been accused of her murder.

In court on Tuesday, the Supreme Court jury heard a confronting recording of the pair’s final conversation, moments before Wright’s fatal fall.

“Can you tell my sister that I’m not a douche?” Wright can be heard asking Tostee.

“Of course, as long as you promise not to beat me up,” he responded.

Only ten minutes later, the mood inside the Gold Coast apartment shifted, as Tostee appeared to get increasingly frustrated with Wright.

“Get up,” he can be heard telling her.

“I’m so sorry,” Wright responded.

“I don’t care. Get up,” he continued, with increased anger in his tone.

“You don’t understand do you, you don’t understand anything at all, do you?” he repeated.

This is when Wright screams: “You let me go home!”

“I would, but you’ve been a bad girl,” he replied.

“No, let me go home!” Wright continues, sounding terrified.

Wright is not heard from again and Tostee can be heard making a call to his father.

“I think she thought it was like a joke or something but she kept like beating me up,” Totee was heard telling his father.

“I forced her off onto the balcony and I think she might have jumped off.

“Like a million cops around my building, I’m f***** I don’t know what to do,” Tostee continued.

The crown alleged that Ms Wright fell while trying to escape Tostee’s apartment balcony due to his increasing anger, which in turn made her increasingly fearful.

The recordings made on Tostee’s mobile phone have become vital evidence in the case.

The accused’s neighbour also told the court they saw Ms Wright clingling to a concrete ledge, saying that she wanted to go home.

Tostee was released on bail for the duration of the trial. He has pleaded not guilty.

He did not speak with media outside the court.

The trial continues tomorrow.

On the confronting audio recording Tostee can also be heard yelling at Wright, “You are lucky I haven't chucked you off my balcony you god damn psycho little b*****”.

The shocking secret recordings were taped on Tostee’s phone, which police later located in his fathers car.

"You're not going to collect any belongings, you're just going to walk out,” Tostee then screamed at Wright.

"If you try to pull anything I'll knock you out, I'll knock you the f*** out - do you understand?"

The audio is 199 minutes in length however the jury will be played an edited version of the recordings.

Following Wright's fall Tostee made a panicked phone call to his father that was also recorded and played back to the court room.

"The last thing I remember she was on the balcony. I don't know if she jumped, I don't know, It wasn't my fault," an anxious Tostee tells his father.

"There’s a million cops around my building, I don’t know what to do," he told his father.

"What if she's dead? What if she jumped?"

He then ends the recording by telling his father, "The last thing I remember is holding her down on the ground in my apartment and then she ran outside".

The jury yesterday were also shown confronting images of the crime scene following the brutal death of Wright.

The police images show rocks littering the floor, an dishevelled bed and a woman’s purse laying by the table were located inside the apartment where Wright spent her last night alive, before falling to her death from Gable Tostee’s 14th floor apartment on the Gold Coast.

Tostee has pleaded not guilty to her murder.

Ms Wright and Tostee went back to his unit in the high-rise Avalon Apartments in the early hours of August 8, 2014, after meeting on the dating app Tinder.

A black purse is pictured on the floor, and a video camera can be seen sitting on a glass coffee table.

A shocking image of two legs dangling off the 14th floor balcony was also shown in court, a product of a police reenactment.

The photograph is taken from the apartment below Tostee’s, and shows the view seen by downstairs neighbour Gabriele Collyer-Wiedner.

Ms Collyer-Wiedner said she woke about 2am to the sound of banging furniture and looked out onto her balcony to see Ms Wright's feet pointing at her.

"Legs came down and dangled in the air," she said.

"I froze there, then the body fell on my balcony railing. I screamed and somebody else screamed, I assumed it was her voice."

She told the court she ran to the railing and looked down to see Ms Wright on the ground and immediately called police.

Photographs inside Tostee’s bedroom show an unmade bed and a stained pillow, while pictures of the balcony reveal a pair of dress shoes lying on the tiles next to a sunbed.

That balcony is where Ms Wright spent her last terrifying minutes, after Tostee allegedly locked her outside.

But lawyers for Tostee claim it was Ms Wright who was “increasingly erratic”, and say he was forced to lock her on the balcony to protect himself.

Ms Wright's mother Beth Wright broke down as the court heard how her daughter was allegedly choked and restrained as Tostee abused her.

In his opening address, defence barrister Saul Holt QC said Tostee did not choke Ms Wright but was within his legal right to protect himself and his property by restraining her.

"She is outside, he is inside and he has caused a locked door to be between the two of them," Mr Holt said.

"What happened in this case is nothing like murder or manslaughter, it doesn't fit."

The court heard after Ms Wright fell to her death Tostee attempted to contact a lawyer and called his father.

"She kept beating me up and whatever," Tostee told his father in the recording.

"I forced her out onto the balcony and I think she might have jumped off."
