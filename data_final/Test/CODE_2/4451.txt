Gable Tostee's new girlfriend has claimed the couple are planning to move to New Zealand once he finishes studying architecture.

Daily Mail Australia this week revealed the identity of Lizzi Evans, the mystery blonde who was Mr Tostee's shoulder to cry on through his murder trial.

The pair are understood to have been in a relationship since at least April, when he was on bail accused of Tinder date Warriena Wright's murder.

But the Gold Coast man and his new beau successfully managed to keep their love affair under wraps until after he was cleared of responsibility for Ms Wright's death.

Ms Evans reportedly told the program she and her boyfriend were planning to move to New Zealand together once he finished studying architecture. Mr Tostee has previously told friends he plans a 'fresh start'

Earlier this year, Ms Evans spoke to A Current Affair about her partner in an interview about a dodgy pair of shoes she purchased from an online store this year.

'He's been a good guy and trying to make the girlfriend happy,' Ms Evans laughed.

'I'm sort of upset about these shoes, I'm ranting and raving - "I'm never going to wear these"

'And he said to me let me see if I've had a go, and I'll see if I can modify them into something potentially you can wear'.

She revealed the pair were planning to move New Zealand once her boyfriend wraps up his architecture studies - and shared a picture of him fixing her shoes.

Daily Mail Australia had previously been told Mr Tostee was hoping for a 'fresh start' in life and thinking of leaving the Gold Coast.

Ms Evans has since mounted a defence of her 'partner' online - sending a woman who added Mr Tostee on Facebook recently a message confirming she was his partner

Ms Evans accidentally revealed her identity when she posted a Snapchat of her and Mr Tostee at the weekend.

'All Gable ever does is read about himself,' she commentated, as Mr Tostee apparently flicked through a news story about his life.

'I'm not up myself or anything,' Mr Tostee replied dryly.

In an angry post to a New Zealand journalist, she also described death plunge victim Warriena Wright as a 'drunk phyhco' (psycho).
