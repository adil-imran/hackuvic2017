Image Australia: Julian Assange's father slams British and Swedish lawmakers 2:30 Father of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, John Shipton, stated in an interview from Sydney, Friday, that "you can no longer expect fair treatment from British law," following a UN panel ruling that Assange has been 'arbitrarily detained' in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, earlier on Friday. Furthermore, the expert panel demanded that the Swedish and British governments end Assange's "deprivation of liberty, respect his physical integrity and freedom of movement, and afford him the right to compensation." Yet, regardless of the outcome, UK authorities have said they will arrest Assange if he steps on to British territory since they are bound by a European arrest warrant. For the past three years Assange has lived in the Ecuadorian embassy, where he took refuge in order to avoid extradition to Sweden on a rape charge which he denies. Ecuador has granted asylum to Assange, and its foreign minister Ricardo Patino has said the WikiLeaks founder is welcome to stay in the embassy. Assange fears that should he go to Sweden he will be extradited to the USA to faces trial over WikiLeaks' publication of leaked classified US diplomatic cables.

SWEDISH prosecutors say an Ecuadorean official will interrogate WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on their behalf next month in the South American countryâ€™s embassy in London. Assange is accused of rape in an investigation stemming from his visit to Sweden in 2010. He denies the allegations and avoided extradition from Britain in 2012 by seeking asylum at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London.

Swedish prosecutors said Wednesday they have received notice from Ecuador that an Ecuadorean prosecutor will question Assange on Oct. 17.

They said Swedish investigators will be allowed to be present and ask follow-up questions through the Ecuadorean prosecutor.

The interrogation has been delayed multiple times as the two countries discussed conditions and timing.

Swedish prosecutors say they need to question Assange before deciding whether to formally charge him.
