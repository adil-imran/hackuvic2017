Legal experts are criticizing a decision by Supreme Court of Canada nominee Malcolm Rowe to deny a new trial to a sexual assault complainant who was subjected to “gratuitous humiliation and denigration” in court. The decision, which is being appealed by the Crown to the Supreme Court on the grounds that Rowe made several legal errors and failed to remedy an egregious breach of the rape shield law, has come under fresh scrutiny following the announcement of Rowe’s appointment to the top court earlier this week. In the May decision Rowe, then a judge on the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal, slammed Judge Robert Stack for allowing a defence lawyer to read to the jury for no reason, sexually explicit texts between the complainant and her lover and the graphic transcript of a consensual sex tape she made with her husband. The complainant alleged she’d been raped vaginally and anally by her husband, and assaulted several times. He was acquitted on all counts by a jury. The three judges who heard the appeal unanimously agreed that Stack made serious errors and failed to properly apply the rape shield law that strictly limits evidence about a complainant’s sexual history.

But while Chief Justice J. Derek Green found there should be a new trial since the jury might well have reached a different conclusion if they were not exposed to the sexual history evidence, Rowe and Justice Charles White found a new trial was not necessary. “I have reached this conclusion with reluctance given the unfair manner in which the complainant was dealt with,” Rowe wrote for the 2-1 majority. “Nonetheless, I am persuaded by counsel for the respondent that the complainant, by her untruthfulness and the inconsistencies in several areas of her testimony, gravely undermined her credibility.” “It seems to me that to recognize in the decision that the defence gratuitously denigrates and humiliates the complainant and to turn around and not give a new trial to the Crown risks sending the message that it is acceptable to humiliate sexual assault complainants, or that it can be done without consequence,” says Lisa Dufraimont, a criminal law professor at Osgoode Hall.
