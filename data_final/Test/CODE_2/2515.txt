Prostitution is often referred to as the world’s oldest profession. It is a phenomenon that exists in every society across the world. Our country is no exception. As The National reported yesterday, some areas in Abu Dhabi take on a darker aspect at night when sex workers openly negotiate with potential clients.

While we urge virtuous behaviour, it would be naive for anybody to think that prostitution does not exist. As such, it must be dealt with. It is a matter of grave concern for many reasons, not least because it’s a social nuisance. Residents in some areas along Hamdan Street and in Al Zahiyah complain that it is scarcely possible to walk the streets at night without coming across a woman soliciting. This is taking a toll on local businesses, whose owners fear it is driving away customers, and on families who live near by. One resident said that he does not know how to explain the presence of the women – and their potential clients – to his young sons when he takes them to a popular family restaurant in Hamdan Street.

Despite regular police raids and successful convictions for the crime of soliciting immorality, the women keep on returning. Demand for their services seems to be driven by a gender imbalance, due to the large numbersof male blue-collar workers who live far away from their families. Often the women are brought into the country on false pretences by human traffickers and organised criminal gangs.

As well as being a legal and moral issue, prostitution poses a public health risk. Apart from the risk of STDs, women who live at close quarters in illegal accommodation are susceptible to communicable diseases such as tuberculosis which can be passed on to the general community.

Like any other crime, eliminating prostitution altogether may not be achievable. However, we urge the authorities to continue to clamp down on the activities of the street walkers, especially in areas popular with families, for the safety and well-being of the entire community.
