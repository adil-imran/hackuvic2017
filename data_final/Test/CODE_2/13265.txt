A man who worked as a bodyguard for Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie for a year-and-a-half opens up about the estranged couple's fear their kids would be kidnapped and held for ransom, and much more, in an insightful new interview.

Mark Billingham, a decorated ex-member of the British Army, spoke with The Sun on some of the the eyebrow-raising anecdotes he picked up in nearly 18 months as head of security for the Mr. & Mrs. Smith stars and their six kids.

Among them include the painstaking measures they took to ensure their brood was safe, and the numerous run-ins with stalkers of the former king and queen of the A-list.

Careful: Pitt, 52, and Jolie, 41, were fearful their children could be kidnapped or held for ransom, according to their former bodyguard. The former couple, seen here in February in Los Angeles, broke up last month when Jolie filed for divorce

'The biggest concern for them was the kidnapping of the kids, it’s all about money,' Billingham told the paper of the couple's laser-focus on protecting the six children - Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Vivienne and Knox, eight.

Billingham said that the Pitt, 52, and Jolie, 41, 'trusted [him] with the kids,' so much so that as he bonded with the celeb clan, he 'could take the kids anywhere [he] wanted to on [his] own.'

He also said that the former power couple were constantly uneasy about who would go near their children, to the point that they were mindful of security professionals when the occasion called for it.

'Even when I wanted to bring in extra people, they wouldn’t let any of those near the kids,' he said to The Sun. The added guards 'could look out for them from a distance but they couldn’t physically touch them.'

Billingham spent so much time around the kids, he said he felt like he 'fathered them, basically.'

DailyMail.com has reached out to both Pitt and Jolie's reps. Reps for Pitt have declined to comment.

Special connection: Billingham said the exes and their kids immediately took to him

Billingham - who also has provided protection for stars such as Russell Crowe, Sean Penn and Tom Cruise - said that he spent much of his time keeping Pitt and Jolie protected from stalkers.

He recalled a chilling situation that even reminded him of the December 8, 1980 murder of John Lennon at the hands of crazed fan Mark David Chapman.

'Angie was filming in a crowd and everyone’s got smiles on their faces except for one guy: He looked angry,' Billingham said to The Sun. 'A few days later we were coming off set and this guy came running down the road with photos to be signed.

The security guard said that Jolie wanted to get out of the vehicle to do it but he denied her and instead got the photos himself and took them to her. After seeing them, he said she was surprised how personal the snaps were.

Billingham said when he confronted the man, 'the guy ran off - [but] then reappeared days later near the hotel - so I [had] him arrested.'

Scary: The ex-guard recalled a terrifying tale involving a stalker focused on Angelina, seen here in 2014 in Los Angeles

He later learned that the man had been 'following Angie all over the states.'

Billingham also explained to The Sun that the Fight Club star needed more protection than the Maleficent beauty.

'People love her but hate him,' he said. 'You have to figure out a way of protecting them from all that. It was challenging, but interesting.”

Strange dynamic: The security pro said that while people generally like Jolie, there's some hostility toward Pitt. He added, 'You have to figure out a way of protecting them from all that'

Billingham, who also has six kids, said he eventually had to quit the job because he 'lost direction in [his] own family life' amid the endless hours keeping an eagle eye on the famous family.

'I never had a private life; I was exhausted,' he told The Sun, adding he still does occasional freelance work for the stars, who parted ways amid Jolie's filing for divorce from Pitt last month.

Billingham said, 'In 17 months, I was only home for six weeks - it was just too full-on.'
