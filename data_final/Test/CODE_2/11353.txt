HARARE - Thousands of youths — led by Bulawayo Youth Arise (Buya) — are plotting to protest against President Robert Mugabe’s misrule and the worsening economic situation next week.

The youths, drawn from various political parties and several youth organisations, will for the first time join hands in the demonstration, scheduled for August 31.

“It’s no secret that this party called Zanu PF under its old and clueless leader has failed to deliver and it’s a fact that as youths we have borne the brunt,” Buya spokesperson, Alfred Dzirutwe, said.

“...we are expecting thousands to join us in declaring to government that enough is enough. I guess that’s the language they will understand better,” he said.

The demonstration is one in many anti-Mugabe protests that have rocked Zimbabwe in the past few months.

“It cannot be over emphasised that Bulawayo, once an industrial hub, is now a scrap yard coupled with deliberate marginalisation,” Dzirutwe said.

Meanwhile, church organisations have rescheduled their march to push Mugabe’s government to deal with the country’s persisting socio-economic and political crises to tomorrow (Thursday).

The march, which was previously slated for Wednesday last week, had been cancelled as it clashed with the pressure group Tajamuka’s demonstration.

A representative of the church organisations — Zimbabwe Devine Destiny (ZDD), Prayer Network of Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe Pastors Fellowship, Christian Voice and Zimbabwe Christian Alliance — said they wanted the march to be a purely church-initiated protest.

“We could not join with the other protestors because we wanted it to be a church-initiated march,” ZDD leader Ancelimo Magaya said.

The churches also plan to present a document to the Botswana Embassy directed to Sadc, for the block’s intervention.

“This is because Botswana President Ian Khama is the current Sadc chairman.”

“The church is generally marching in solidarity with the suffering masses

“And we want government to address the concerns that include corruption and poverty, victimisation of protestors as well as church leaders and also what they are doing to war veterans, we want that to stop,” Magaya told the Daily News before the earlier march was cancelled.
