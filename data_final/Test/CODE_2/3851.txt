NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate has taken a legal opinion on Nalini Chidambaram , wife of former union finance minister P Chidambaram, after she had refused to appear before the investigating team at the agency's Kolkata office. The ED is likely to issue fresh summons to Nalini and insist for her presence with documents relating to payments she had received in connection with the Saradha group.The ED had last month issued a summons seeking her presence at the agency's Kolkata office in connection with her association with some of the key accused in the Saradha chit fund scam . She is learnt to have refused to honour the summons taking the plea that being a woman she may be questioned at her home as per the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).A source said a legal opinion, obtained by the ED, has rejected her contention observing that the provisions of the CrPC doesn't apply in her case as the agency is probing the Saradha chit fund scam under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and her presence is sought in that connection.Nalini Chidambaram is being investigated for her role in investments made by the main accused and Saradha group chief Sudipta Sen in some media ventures in the North-Eastern states, and if Nalini had benefited from the deal. Allegations were made by Sen in his letter to CBI that some politicians and their kin had blackmailed him into investing huge amounts in their publications and TV channel.The agency is likely to ask her to join the probe at the ED's Kolkata office under Section 50 of the PMLA where the ED has powers of a civil court for examining a witness under oath.The Section 50 of PMLA is related to powers of authorities regarding summons, production of documents and to submit evidence. The act provides that the director of ED for the purpose of inquiry has the same powers as vested in a civil court and can enforce attendance of any person and examining him/her on oath."The director, additional director, joint director, deputy director or assistant director shall have power to summon any person whose attendance he considers necessary whether to give evidence or to produce any records during the course of any investigation or proceeding under this Act," according to Section 50 of PMLA.The ED had earlier attached properties worth more than Rs 500 crore belonging to several accused in the case, including the assets of main accused Sudipta Sen and his Saradha group of companies. The properties were attached under PMLA in West Bengal, Assam, Delhi, UP and Maharashtra.There were allegations of Rs 42 crore investments in a Guwahati-based channel at the insistence of some influential people, which Sen had claimed was done after he was "blackmailed" and in lieu of bailing him out of legal cases against the group.
