Will fin breid, barley-bree an paintit room. Whan MacLean meets wi's friens in Springburn. Aa thae roses an geeans will turn tae blume. An a black laud frae yont Nyanga. Dings the fell gallows o the burghers doun.

Black an white ane-til-ither mairriet. Mak the vile barracks o thair maisters bare. Sae come aa ye at hame wi freedom. Never heed whit the houdies croak for Doom. In yer hous aa the bairns o Aidam.

Tak the road an seek ither loanins. Wi thair ill-ploys tae sport an play. Nae mair will our bonnie callants. Merch tae war whan our braggarts crousely craw. Nor wee weans frae pitheid an clachan. Murn the ships sailin doun the Broomielaw. Broken faimilies in launs we've hairriet. Will curse 'Scotlan the Brave' nae mair, nae mair.

Roch the win i the clear day's dawin. Blaws the clouds heilster-gowdie owre the bay. But thair's mair nor a roch win blawin. Thro the Great Glen o the warl the day. It's a thocht that wad gar our rottans. Aa thae rogues that gang gallus fresh an gay.

DAVID Mundell has said coming out was “one of the most difficult” things he has done in his life — but also one of the best.

DAVID Mundell has said coming out was “one of the most difficult” things he has done in his life — but also one of the best.

The Scottish Secretary, and lone Conservative MP north of the Border, was inundated with messages of support after he made history in January by becoming the first Conservative Cabinet minister to reveal he was gay.

Last night, he spoke of the decision at the PinkNews awards in London where Kezia Dugdale, who announced in April that she had a female partner, won the parliamentarian category of Member of the Year.

Mundell told the audience: “While coming out earlier this year was one of the most difficult things I have done in my life, it’s also proved to be among the best. There is no template for it and everybody must do what is right for them and their personal circumstances, but I have no regrets.

“I said at the time that I did it for myself and it really has made a difference to personal happiness by allowing me to be completely the person I am. I am so grateful not just to all those who have offered me their love and support since I came out, but to those who went before and helped make my path so much easier than it would have been only a few years ago.”

Mundell added: “I am delighted to be part of this year’s PinkNews Awards, which celebrate a huge range of contributions to LGBT+ equality.

It is right we mark these achievements and the way much our society has changed for the better, but we can’t be complacent and we must face up to and tackle homophobia wherever it exists, particularly where it manifests itself as the bullying too many young people have to endure.

“I also want to see work continue to address the issues that face the transgender community across the UK and bring them the equality they deserve.”

Speaking as she accepted her award, Dugdale also said Scotland must guard against any sense of complacency on gay rights, and urged other LGBT politicians who had not done so to come out, too.

Her speech came a day after the Scottish Government announced it would be bringing in legislation to pardon men convicted of same-sex offences now abolished.

Dugdale said: “We like to say Scotland now has the gayest Parliament in the world, that Scotland is a

wonderful place to be gay. And for many it is ... but we must guard against any sense of complacency. We know from our experience that it is often when people feel at their most insecure, their most threatened, that hate crime and intolerance comes to the fore. We saw that recently with the doubling in reported hate crimes.

“When times are tough, it is too often minority groups – of all types – that are first to pay the price. So we can’t lose sight of the battles that are still ahead for us. Not just in battling the discrimination that still exists in many of our schools and workplaces and hate that still scars our commun-ities, but in the fight for resources and support that we need to thrive.”

She added: “So, in accepting this award tonight, I’m not taking it for myself. I’m taking it for the generations of LGBT politicians who I hope will come after me, and who every one of us in this room has to inspire to come forward.

“And for all the LGBT people in public office, and public life, today who – for one reason or another – have decided not to come out yet. The words of Harvey Milk should ring in our ears: coming out is the most political thing you can do.”

Other speakers at the event included the SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and shadow home secretary Diane Abbott.

John Nicolson, the SNP MP who last week saw his Turing Bill which would have pardoned men in England and Wales for now abolished same-sex crimes blocked, was also shortlisted in the parliamentarian category.

Mundell, MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale, has three children with his ex-wife Lynda

Carmichael. Responding to Mundell coming out, his son Oliver, elected in May as a Conservative MSP, tweeted at the time: “I admire my dad as much today as I did yesterday. Brave decision to go public and the right one.”
