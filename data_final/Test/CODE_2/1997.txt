NO, it wasn’t US presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton or British Royals Charles and Camilla whose motorcade brought King William St to a standstill on Thursday.

It was the Vice Governor of Shandong, a province on China’s east coast, Xia Geng.

While not world famous like previous visitors to the state — more like China’s answer to Deputy Premier John Rau — he arrived in Adelaide leading a 250-strong delegation of Chinese officials and business people.

After arriving at Adelaide Airport at about 3.30pm, the official motorcade was given a “green light corridor” to a city hotel.

Traffic heading north on King William St at about 4pm yesterday came to a holt when the lights and the North Tce intersection remained red much longer than usual to allow the Chinese contingent to pass.

The visit marks the 30th anniversary of South Australia’s a sister-state relationship with Shandong.

To mark the occasion a bronze sculpture called the Bridge, jointly created by South Australian Tim Thomson and Chi Hao from Shandong was unveiled at a welcome dinner at Adelaide Town Hall.

Trade Minister Martin Hamilton-Smith said the Government was delighted to welcome the Shandong delegation to celebrate 30 years of our sister state relationship.

“This week is all about showing the delegation that SA is open for business and investment from China,” he said.

Opposition trade spokesman Tim Whetstone said the sister city relationship with Shandong had been and would continue to be an important link in leveraging export and investment opportunities for the state as well as cultural ties.

“China is South Australia’s largest two-way trading partner and the respect that has built up over 30 years is a crucial element for continually harnessing export opportunities,” he said.

“With adequate support, there is great potential for increased interaction and prosperity between the state and province in years to come.”
