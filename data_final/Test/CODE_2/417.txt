A shocking report said each week at least one asylum-seeker is suspected of being radicalised by the death cult, which expected to lash out as it faces defeat in the middle east. In November last year, Denmark’s Immigration Minister demanded reception centres report all migrants displaying worrying behaviour. More than 50 residents have been reported in less than 11 months, and the cases include adults watching and hailing ISIS execution videos and children beheading teddy bears.

In addition to watching the terrorists’ propaganda videos, some residents have also warned their fellow asylum-seekers about what happens “when you are not a real Muslim”. One of the incidents included several asylum-seekers receiving death threats from a fellow resident after they held a candle lit vigil in memory of the people who lost their life during the Belgian terror attacks. Another case involves a resident expressing a desire to join ISIS and communicating with the extremists with the phone app Tango.

Immigration Minister Inger Støjberg has confirmed there are serious cases of radicalism within Danish reception centres.
