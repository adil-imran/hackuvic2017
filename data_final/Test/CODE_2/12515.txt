The Ramlila organisers at Indraprastha in east Delhi are planning to burn an effigy that signifies “Terrorist nation Pakistan”, on Tuesday.

Every year, on Dussehra, the committee chooses a “social evil” that is to be eradicated from the society and burns an effigy that symbolises this, in addition to the effigies of Ravan, Khumbkaran and Meghnath. “This year we have chosen to burn an effigy symbolising ‘terrorist nation’ Pakistan,” said Suresh Bindal, the president of the committee.

The effigy will feature ‘10 faces of terrorism’, which will include the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, the chief of army staff, Raheel Sharif, along with Maulana Fazal-ur-Rehman, a politician of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam party, and Masood Azhar, the founder and leader of the terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed.

It will also feature some other international faces of terrorism, such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who has been called the chief architect of the 9/11 attacks, and Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State.

“The issue to be symbolised and burnt to the ground is chosen by a popular vote,” said Bindal. “This year, the audience, organisers and other voting members had to choose between terrorist nation Pakistan, road rage, rape culture, and diseases or bacteria. Almost 98% of the voters chose terrorist nation Pakistan as the issue we need to address and fight.”

The effigy is to be set ablaze at 7.30pm on Tuesday at the Indraprastha ground in Pataparganj.

The committee has been organising theme-based Ramlila for the last 25 years. “In the past, we have burnt effigies that symbolised Veerapan, honour killings, Khap panchyats, adulteration, among others,” said Bindal.

Meanwhile, Ramlila committees in the Walled City area said they have not planned for anything like that. “We don’t do such things or burn themed effigies. This year too, we will do it in a traditional manner,” Ashok Agarwal, chairman, Luv Kush Ramlila Committee.
