About Loo

I'm a native Washingtonian - born in Alexandria and raised in Silver Spring. I hardly attended class at John F. Kennedy High School. Was too busy running the school radio station. (The same one I brought in from my bedroom. My parents got sick of all the loud music.) Anyway, 45 years later, I'm on the air at my favorite hometown station, 97.1 WASH-FM. I'm blessed to be married to Wendy, a wonderful New Jersey gurl and have two amazing kids, Max & Bonnie that keep us busy and happily frustrated. Thanks for reading AND listening! Email Loo!

About Chilli

Unlike most people who live in the DC area...I'm actually FROM here. I was born in Northwest, DC and raised in Vienna, Virginia. I'm first generation Armenian-American. Shortly after graduating from Mary Washington College (now it's University of Mary Washington), I was lucky enough to land a radio gig back in DC. I've worked on the air in this market since 1996, as a news reporter/anchor, morning show side-kick, afternoon personality and traffic reporter.

A little more about my personal interests... I'm a book worm (I've been known to read at least one novel a week). My favorite book is "To Kill a Mockingbird". I'm addicted to "Grey's Anatomy", "Boardwalk Empire", "Game of Thrones", "The Following", "The Americans" and "Breaking Bad"...don't even think about calling me during those shows! My favorite movie of all-time is "Rocky." One of the highlights of my career was interviewing Sylvester Stallone.

After several heartbreaks, I finally met a guy who actually MEANT it when he said "I want to marry you someday." My husband (Don) and I met in December 2007... and got married on May 22nd, 2011. Like me... Don is also a native Washingtonian.

Also: I don't like walking on grates, I'm SUPER competitive, I have a tendency to "sing speak" when I get excited (you may even hear me do it on the air sometimes...LOL). I've become a HUGE Washington Capitals fan since meeting my husband. Oh...and I'm a pop culture junkie. My guilty pleasures are bad reality TV and celebrity gossip. Email Chilli!
