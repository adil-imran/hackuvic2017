Cape Town A small community in Malmesbury, known as Riverlands, is the setting for one of the most horrific child sex cases that has found its way to the Western Cape’s specialised sexual offences courts.

A Stikland man found himself a surrogate family, including a six-year-old child who is at the centre of one of the biggest sexual offences prosecutions in the Western Cape.

The child, whose identity is legally protected, turned the 57-year-old man in to the police and set in motion a probe that had investigators’ blood running cold.

The list of charges against the man adds up to 161 155 of which were allegedly perpetrated against the child, who is now 10.

The State alleges he built up a relationship with the girl’s family until they trusted him enough to allow him to take the child out on his own. It is further alleged he took the child shopping, gave her money and bought her expensive items, including a cellphone.

One of the counts against him is the unusual charge of sexual grooming in which the State alleges he provided the little girl with a vibrator in order to encourage her to engage in sexual activity.

He also faces charges of rape, sexual assault and contraventions of the Sexual Offences and Related Matters Act.

The man was arrested in November last year and police confiscated a laptop, a hard drive and a cellphone. Child pornography videos and images were allegedly found on the devices.

The man allegedly created 140 photographic images and six video clips depicting the child in various sexually suggestive positions or engaging in sexual acts, sometimes with sex toys. In one of the images, she can be seen holding a R100 note in her hand. The images were captured late at night on various dates last year.

The man is also accused of sexually abusing the child’s friend - who was 13 years old at the time.

He faces four rapes charges and two of sexual assault as a result of alleged sexual assaults perpetrated against her.

He has been in custody for almost a year, having abandoned his bail application two months ago.

The legislature has prescribed a minimum sentence of life imprisonment for the rape of a minor.

The accused made a brief appearance in the Sexual Offences Court in Parow on Monday.

Prosecutor Dersia Rabie requested a postponement to give the accused more time to negotiate a possible plea bargain with the State.

Magistrate Amanda van Leeve postponed the case to next month when the outcome of the negotiations are expected to be known.
