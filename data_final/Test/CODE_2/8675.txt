Donald Trump’s business reputation and all the products he has branded (as well as his daughter’s) are imperiled for multiple reasons. Most important from the standpoint of his gigantic ego and his contempt for failure, he is going to be a loser on Election Day.

He will not be just any loser, but in all likelihood will be a worse loser than people he’s mocked (e.g. Mitt Romney, Arizona Sen. John McCain). The election will go down as one of the most inept presidential efforts in modern times, and his debate performances will be ridiculed for years. To boot he’ll have lost to a weak candidate, a woman no less.

Couple that with his image now as a creepy groper and a bigot, and you can understand why people with money wouldn’t want to identify with him. (“Experts say the Trump brand is tarnished and at a tricky crossroads as his appeal shifts from the well-heeled, high-income people he has long courted to a more middle-class base, including the fervent fans he cultivated during the campaign,” Fortune reports.) To the extent woman make many purchasing decisions (as much as 80 percent of consumer purchases), his predatory behavior toward young women will come back to haunt him.

Sure enough, it has gotten so bad that his very name is coming off hotels. Forbes reports:

Claiming his personal brand is worth billions, real estate mogul and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has put his name on everything over the years, from hotels to neckties. That’s about to change with Trump’s new line of lifestyle hotels, which will not bear the Trump name. Trump Hotels announced late last month that its newest millennial-focused hotel brand will be called “Scion,” according to a press release. The name means “descendant of a notable family” and is intended to be a subtle reference to Trump–without mentioning his name. The hotel line will be aimed at lifestyle, rather than luxury, customers, the announcement said.

It’s an even bigger problem when you consider that a good deal of Trump’s business is now licensing his name. Last year Forbes reported:

Donald Trump positions himself as a real estate visionary and developer, and he’s created a remarkable brand. In truth, however, Trump doesn’t own a large number of his properties. He licenses his name to developers and offers property management services. For instance, his name is on 17 properties in Manhattan, but he only owns five of them outright. . . . Money from licensing the Trump name makes up an increasing share of Donald Trump’s wealth, although it’s hard to peg how much he actually has. In 2014, he claimed a net worth of $8.7 billion, $3.3 billion of which came from “real estate deal, brand, and branded developments.” Bloomberg Politics, on the other hand, estimates Trump’s net worth at $2.9 billion, but it primarily takes into account the real estate he actually owns. Bloomberg’s report estimates Trump’s licensing take at between $32 million and $55 million.

If he cannot put his name on anything, his earning potential crashes. The irony is as vivid as it is breathtaking: The man who put his name on everything — vodka, chocolate, ties, a fake university, a magazine, a board game, a mortgage brokerage — can’t put it on hotels. (It’s not like you’d want to throw a sweet-16 party for your daughter there or put up your business execs — male or female — in one of them, unless you want guffaws and complaints.)

Trump’s new political fan base is less educated and lacks the financial resources of the rich and famous with whom Trump has tried to ingratiate himself for his entire life. It’s predominately men, who do not drive the consumer-goods market. The boy from Queens who wanted to show Manhattan elites he was important is now decidedly out of fashion, low-end and even seedy. He can’t even use his name in public, so to speak. How disappointed his father would be to see his name in ruins.

No wonder Trump seems more unraveled than ever. He’s about to fail on the biggest stage he’s ever been on. The people whose approbation he lusted after now can poke fun, sneer — and spend their money elsewhere. It must be driving him nuts just thinking about it.
