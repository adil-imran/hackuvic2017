Hyderabad, Sep 9 (PTI) Pandemonium broke out in the Andhra Pradesh Assembly on second day of the three-day monsoon session here today with the opposition YSR Congress members creating a ruckus over the issue of special category status for the state.

Unruly scenes were witnessed as the opposition legislators entered into a scuffle with marshals inside the House, as the MLAs stormed the Speakers podium for the second consecutive day demanding an immediate discussion on the special status issue.

An adjournment of the proceedings did not ensure any order, but only led to more trouble as some of the unrelenting YSRC MLAs climbed onto the House reporters table in front of the Speakers podium.

One MLA was found breaking the Speakers mike while a couple of others broke the railing to the podium.

A television camera, placed adjacent to the Speakers podium, recording the House proceedings was also damaged in the melee.

There was pushing and shoving between the YSRC legislators and the marshals with the latter trying to block the former from advancing towards the Speaker.

Speaker Kodela Sivaprasada Rao then adjourned the House for the second time.

Earlier in the day, the Speaker admonished both the MLAs and the marshals, and adjourned the proceedings for 10 minutes as the opposition protest grew noisy.

The YSRC members, wearing black robes, were on their feet as soon as the House sat for the days proceedings at 9 AM. They demanded that a discussion, through their adjournment motion, be immediately taken up on the special status issue.

Legislative Affairs Minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said the government on its own agreed to make a statement in the House on the announcement made by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley extending a special financial package to AP.

"The Chief Minister was ready to make the statement yesterday but you did not allow it. As decided in the Business Advisory Committee meeting, we can have a discussion in the House only after the Chief Minister makes the statement," Yanamala said. (MORE) PTI DBV GK SMJ
