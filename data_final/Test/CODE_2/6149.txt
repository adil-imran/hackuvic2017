A European Union effort to launch an independent inquiry into Yemen's civl war has been dumbed down after the UK refused to support it.

The Netherlands had proposed that the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) set up an independent inquiry into civilian deaths in Yemen, but foreign secretary Boris Johnson rejected calls for Britain to support the international inquiry last week.

He insisted that the Government is "using a very, very wide variety of information sources about what is happening to acquaint ourselves with the details" about the war in Yemen, where a Saudi Arabia-led coalition is accused of committing war crimes.

In a joint open letter, Human Rights Watch and other NGOs called for the HRC to "establish an international, independent me­chanism to investigate alleged serious violations and abuses of international human rights and humanitarian law committed" in Yemen.

However, after the UK refused to lend its support, the Netherlands' proposal was watered down to suggest the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) dispatch a mission to monitor the situation.

“Blocking attempts to create an international inquiry is a betrayal of the people of Yemen who have suffered so much during this conflict,” Polly Truscott of Amnesty International said.

“It’s shocking. The UK ought to be standing up for justice and accountability, not acting as a cheerleader for arms companies.”

Two senior MPs have since urged Mr Johnson to back the independent probe, saying the matter was urgent in light of the country's growing death toll.

On Friday, the OHCHR expressed "deep concern" over increasing attacks against civilians in Yemen after a total of 180 civilians were killed in one month, raising the death toll to nearly 4,000 since the conflict began in March 2015.

Cecile Pouilly at the UN agency said August also saw an increase in the number of attacks against civilian facilities including hospitals, markets, and places of worship.

Her statement came only two days after airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition bombed houses in the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah, killing at least 32 civilians.

Many migrants reported that prior to their deportation they had been packed into overcrowded makeshift detention facilities where they received little food and water and were abused by guards.

Earlier this month leaked draft report from Britain's Committee on Arms Exports Control said Britain shoult halt its sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia while accusations of war crimes are investigated.

The committee, which comprises 16 MPs from four parties, also said it was likely British weapons had been used to violate international law.

Both the European Parliament and the House of Commons International Development Committee have already called for exports to the autocracy to stop, but the Government says it has not seen evidence of Saudi war crimes.

Tom Brake, foreign affairs spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said: "Again the UK Government are trying to cover up the Saudi Arabian military’s flagrant violations of international humanitarian law.

"A fully independent international enquiry is the least the people of Yemen deserve, yet instead Boris Johnson chooses to put Britain’s interests, in the form of arms exports to Saudi Arabia, over the urgent need for a full investigation into human rights' abuses.

"Under the May Government, the FCO have abandoned any pretence of an ethical foreign policy. It is all about trade and arms sales now "



Meanwhile, rebels known as Houthis have continued to tighten their siege on the city of Taiz, where they are fighting local forces aligned with the internationally-recognised government.
