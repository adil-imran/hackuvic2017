Leader of Senate probe into drug war is ousted

A senator in the Philippines who led an investigation into the president’s bloody anti-drug campaign was ousted Monday from the justice committee in a vote that human rights advocates said could derail accountability in the crackdown.

President Rodrigo Duterte’s allies led the vote that removed Sen. Leila de Lima from the Committee on Justice and Human Rights, which has spearheaded an inquiry into the widespread killings of drug suspects that have alarmed President Obama, the United Nations and rights groups.

More than 3,000 drug suspects have died in the crackdown since Duterte assumed the presidency on June 30. More than 600,000 have surrendered for fear of being killed.

De Lima’s ouster “is a blatant and craven move to derail accountability for the appalling death toll from President Rodrigo Duterte’s abusive ‘war on drugs,’ ” U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said.

De Lima has had a running feud with Duterte. As head of the government’s human rights commission, she had investigated his alleged role in extrajudicial killings of criminals when he was mayor of Davao City.

Duterte has accused de Lima of involvement in illegal drugs. She has denied the allegation, but the president’s allies in the House of Representatives are set to launch an inquiry on Tuesday.

Police: 2 Palestinians killed in West Bank

Two Palestinians were killed Monday as they tried to stab Israeli police officers in the West Bank city of Hebron, while a third Palestinian was shot and wounded after stabbing two Israeli police officers in Jerusalem, police said.

The incidents followed a weekend in which four Palestinians were killed while attacking Israelis, according to Israeli authorities, raising fears of a return to the near-daily Palestinian attacks seen at times over the past year.

Police spokeswoman Luba Samri said that in Hebron, two assailants tried to stab soldiers guarding a checkpoint, lightly wounding one officer before the troops opened fire, killing the attackers.

Earlier Monday, a Palestinian stabbed two Israeli police officers outside Jerusalem’s Old City before being shot and critically wounded, Samri said. The officers were wounded.

Among the four Palestinians killed over the weekend was one who held Jordanian citizenship, 28-year-old Said Amro.

Jordan has demanded a detailed explanation from Israel about the killing of Amro. Israeli police said he rushed out of Jerusalem’s Old City armed with knives and tried to stab officers before being shot.

Pakistan stays execution of mentally ill man: A Pakistani official said the Supreme Court has temporarily stayed the execution of a mentally ill man. Imdad Ali was convicted in a 2001 murder case and has exhausted all appeals. A clemency request to the president was rejected, and Ali was to be executed. But Prison Superintendent Syed Babar Ali said he received an order to halt the execution until the top court hears a petition next week. A state-appointed doctor has diagnosed Ali with schizophrenia and argued against hanging.
