: The government has launched the preliminary steps for setting up the Kerala Cancer Registry so that a realistic estimate of the State’s cancer burden, the reasons for the apparent increase in cancers amongst the population in the recent years, and the geographic pattern of distribution of the disease can be obtained.

Kerala has at present two population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) under the Indian Council for Medical Research, the one run by the Regional Cancer Centre (RCC) in Thiruvananthapuram, and the other run in Kollam district.

Till date, all estimates of the State’s cancer burden has been an extrapolation of the data yielded by these two registries even though these cover only about 25 per cent of the State’s population.

A six-member committee of oncologists and public health experts set up by the government , with the Director of the RCC, Paul Sebastian, as the convener to study the State’s cancer burden, has now suggested that while setting up a PBCR in every district might not be a feasible option, the State can think of setting up a network of hospital-based cancer registries (HBCRs) — in both public and private sector hospitals — as the first step towards the Kerala Cancer Registry.

The Malabar Cancer Centre (MCC) is already attempting to set up PBCRs in two districts of Kasaragod and Kannur. Hospital-based cancer registries are already being maintained by several hospitals in the State, including the five Government Medical Colleges in Thiruvananthapuram, Alappuzha, Thrissur, Kozhikode and Kottayam, the RCC, MCC and some private sector hospitals.

Setting up PBCRs in every district could be a very expensive proposition for the State, as it would cost approximately Rs. 25 lakh annually to maintain a single PBCR.

The committee, it is learnt, has now recommended that if HBCRs can be set up in all government and private hospitals in the State with radiotherapy facilities, about 75 per cent of the State’s population can be covered and a more realistic picture of the State’s cancer burden can be obtained.

If the government issues an executive order that all private hospitals treating cancer patients should mandatorily share the data with the HBCRs, data coverage would improve.

A challenge

One challenge that is being anticipated is that when the number of HBCRs go up, there could be a duplication of records as patients normally move from one hospital to the other. The committee has thus recommended that it is necessary for HBCRs to share data and that all data be pooled to evolve a final picture. A network of HBCRs would certainly help the bio statisticians and epidemiologists design and plan epidemiological studies across districts; draw vital inferences on the State’s region-wise variations in cancer pattern and estimate cancer mortality, survival figures, assess the accessibility to and quality of cancer treatment and monitor the health system’s performance.

“This would be vital data for health planners and policy makers and will help the government channelise its health investment better,” a senior Health official said.
