Aleppo. The U.N. is giving up on plans to evacuate the sick and wounded from the rebel-controlled eastern half of Aleppo, after intense ground fighting and airstrikes again hit the shattered city following a three-day ceasefire that ended Saturday.

While activist groups on the ground say that airstrikes started pounding the city again over the weekend, Russian Defense ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov insisted Russian and Syrian planes had not even flown near the city since last Tuesday. “Flights over Aleppo by the Russian and Syrian air forces have been completely halted for the last seven days,” said Konashenkov in a statement. Syrian government troops kicked off a new offensive in the city on Monday, however, shelling rebel positions and taking a key hilltop in the southern reaches of town.

Mosul grinds on. In another city under siege – Mosul — the slow, bloody fight toward the city line continues for Iraqi and Kurdish forces and their American special operations advisors, supported by withering airstrikes from the U.S.-led coalition.

The U.S. Central Command said coalition aircraft hit ISIS positions in the town of Rutbah near the Syrian and Jordanian borders on Monday in an attempt to push ISIS out. The group stormed the town over the weekend. Around Mosul, coalition jets destroyed 22 “fighting positions,” along with dozens of vehicles, tunnel entrances, mortar systems, communications towers and buildings. Reports are also beginning to surface that ISIS fighters within the city — estimated at about 5,000 — are calling for reinforcements from the group’s de facto capital of Raqqa in Syria.

Because we have to. And what does Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump, think about Mosul? As with most other subjects he mentions, he called the ongoing, and largely successful, assault a “disaster,” as he Tweeted Sunday. Trump followed that up with his continuing befuddlement that Iraqi forces didn’t launch a “sneak attack” — with 30,000 troops across a mostly flat terrain from bases dozens, if not hundreds, of miles away — against the Islamic State held city. He also told Pat Robertson on The 700 Club, “you see what’s going on. You see how badly that fight is going.” At a rally in Florida, he also doubled down on his contention that the fight, which began last week, was launched to tilt the election in Hillary Clinton’s favor, FP’s Molly O’Toole writes.

Iran deal. What’s new? On Capitol Hill, the good news for Democrats is, not much. FP’s Dan De Luce and Molly O’Toole report that Democratic lawmakers in Congress don’t look to be paying much of a political price for supporting President Barack Obama’s deal with Iran last year, despite warnings that their support would be political suicide. Part of the reason? Donald Trump, who with his boorish behavior and outlandish and just plain false statements, has sucked almost all of the air out of the room this election season, leaving much less time or energy for policy debates.

Also, the duo write, “With Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton consistently ahead in national polls and widening her lead in key states, pro-Israel hawks are mostly resigned to a Clinton victory and see no reason to antagonize the next administration — as well as a possible Democratic majority in the Senate.”

New model army. A total of ten U.S. Army soldiers have formally asked to be recognized as their new, preferred gender, just weeks after the service allowed transgender troops to serve openly, the Associated Press reports. In a statement that would have been all but unthinkable a few short years ago, U.S. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley told the wire service, “it’s going to take a little bit of time, but there are some things I don’t think you need to necessarily be trained on. Rule One is treat your soldiers, your subordinates, your peers and your superiors as you want to be treated. Treat everybody with dignity and respect. Period. Flat out. Full stop.”

Where in the world is Qassem Soleimani? Kurdistan, it appears. The often fetishized commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force paid a visit to the family of Kurdish Peshmerga commander Hussein Mansour on Sunday, the Long War Journal points out. Mansour was killed last year in fighting with the Islamic State. The visit was the first time Soleimani has been spotted since the offensive to oust ISIS from Mosul kicked off last week, but we don’t know exactly where he met with Mansour’s family.
