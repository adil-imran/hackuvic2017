Immigration to be a focus in third debate

With help from Nancy Scola

HERE WE GO AGAIN — It’s almost time for the third and final presidential debate, slated for Wednesday at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Moderator Chris Wallace is scheduled to focus his questions on six topics: entitlements and debt; the Supreme Court; the economy; foreign policy; fitness to serve as president; and immigration — a policy area on which tech has been especially vocal. In particular, tech wants to ensure that high-skilled immigrant workers can gain access to H-1B visas. Mark Zuckerberg’s advocacy group, FWD.us, has been dedicated to this issue, while also championing a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally — one of the many policy points on which Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump offer a stark contrast. We’ll be tracking.

— “Even in Silicon Valley, calls for immigration reform shouldn’t just be a matter of keeping high-skilled technologists and scientists in the country,” Laurene Powell Jobs, president of Emerson Collective and widow of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, writes in an op-ed on immigration published in Wired on Sunday. “A much larger group of immigrants — the struggling and maligned 11 million, more than two-thirds of whom have lived here for more than 10 years — remain trapped in an agonizing state of limbo. The result is that some of our nation’s most industrious individuals are barred from employment in the formal economy.”

THIEL CHIPS IN FOR TRUMP — One of the few Silicon Valley leaders supporting Trump, venture capitalist Peter Thiel is now backing the candidate with his own coin. Thiel, who spoke at the Republican National Convention in July, is donating a total of $1.25 million to a collection of super PACs and to the campaign itself, reports The New York Times, which noted that the donation puts the billionaire “high on a very short list of big Trump contributors.” Trump’s fundraising efforts haven’t fared well in the Valley, with one estimate from Crowdpac pegging his haul from tech at just $300,000, while Clinton has raked in nearly $8 million.

— Sam Altman, president of Y Combinator, an organization for which Thiel serves as a part-time partner , responded to criticism of Thiel’s donation, via several tweets on Sunday evening. “Thiel is a high profile supporter of Trump. I disagree with this,” he writes. “YC is not going to fire someone for supporting a major party nominee.”

TESLA’S NEW PRODUCT DEBUT — Tesla’s got two major product reveals coming up this month, the first of which is set for today . Elon Musk first mentioned the unveiling in a cryptic tweet , revealing that what’s coming is “unexpected by most.” Reports suggest the event could include a final look for the Model 3 and/or a potential update to the Autopilot feature, which has garnered significant attention in recent months after crashes that occurred while drivers were using it. Tesla and SolarCity announced they plan to launch a residential solar roof, which will come with an integrated battery, during another event , on October 28.

MT BYTE-SIZED Q&A: VP CANDIDATE MINDY FINN — Finn is a Republican opposed to Donald Trump. She’s an entrepreneur, a veteran of Washington politics — serving previously as a senior adviser at the Republican National Committee — and the tech industry, having spent a couple of years as a strategist at Twitter. And, as of earlier this month, she’s been the running mate of Evan McMullin , an independent conservative presidential candidate. (POLITICO’s Daniel Strauss has more on the McMullin campaign, and its focus on Utah, here .) In a phone interview from her Virginia home this weekend after a swing through the state, Finn talked with Nancy about the role tech will play in the final days of the race, and what the first days of a McMullin-Finn administration would look like.

What's the campaign’s digital strategy? “With no major party infrastructure, we're running a lean and mean campaign relying heavily on digital — especially social media and data. We Facebook Live [i.e., stream video of] every event. Our events in the Mountain West are now standing-room-only. But our first large-scale joint appearance, a town hall in Syracuse, Utah, on Thursday, reached a half-million people between those who tuned in and those who shared it.”

How might tech issues factor into voters’ decision-making in the home stretch? “We're going after voters inclined to vote Republican but who don't want to give their vote to Trump, someone whose rhetoric has been anti-innovation, anti-technology. We stand in great contrast to that. We think America needs to be an engine of innovation — even more so than it is today."

What's on your tech policy agenda, then? “From the regulatory perspective, there are patents being issued, for example, that are too broadly defined, creating barriers for companies producing something new. Then there are rules meant to keep big banks in check that are hurting community banks; we'd lean towards making it easier for them to lend to startups. For another thing, states are recognizing their students need STEM education to be competitive. We'd love them to have more money to incorporate into those programs.”

What are concrete steps on tech to expect from the early days of your administration? “Our philosophy is one of returning more power back to the states, but there are still critical services that are going to be delivered through the federal government. They should be more efficient and cost less. To get there, I'm for creating more competition in procurement; we need to make the user experience more akin to what Americans are used to on a search engine, or Netflix, or Uber.”

INDUSTRY GROUPS PUSH FOR DIGITAL TRADE UPDATES — Timed to the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) negotiations taking place this week, seven tech advocacy organizations, including the Internet Association, Consumer Technology Association and the Computer and Communications Industry Association, are urging U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman to prioritize digital trade issues. In a letter they’re sending this morning, the groups ask Froman to focus on developing policy that will promote the free flow of data across borders, prohibit local data storage requirements, and cover “new services” that may emerge in the future along with existing ones. “TiSA represents a unique opportunity to create a new framework that promotes cross-border trade in digital services, protects the free and open internet, and encourages the free flow of information, both among TiSA’s twenty-three dynamic economies and around the world,” they write.

SNAPCHAT SIT-DOWN WITH OBAMA — As part of an ongoing effort to develop editorial content for its platform, the photo-sharing app has scored an interview with President Barack Obama, reports Playbook . Snapchat’s Peter Hamby, who has also interviewed Vice President Joe Biden previously, spoke with Obama following a Clinton campaign event in Cleveland on Friday. The conversation is scheduled to run within the next few weeks. Snapchat is also in the process of going public, recently locking down Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to lead its IPO, which could be worth more than $25 billion .

‘TECHY THINGS’ FOR CLINTON IN CALI — In one of WikiLeaks’ latest installments of emails allegedly hacked from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, a group of policy advisers notes that it would be good for Clinton to engage in some “techy things” during a visit to California, reports POLITICO’s David Siders . The suggestion, made in a July 2015 email, came as Clinton tried to fight off Jeb Bush — then, a favored contender for the GOP nomination — in the battle to woo big Silicon Valley donors. Other techie mentions in recent email batches include a message about how the campaign could gain venture capitalist Fred Wilson’s support; a warning about the perils of holding a Valley fundraiser featuring Theranos head Elizabeth Holmes; and an email advising Team Clinton to make a speech draft sound more “forward-leaning” on tech, as opposed to a “self-deprecating” approach that made her seem tech-challenged.

— Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Tim Kaine talked of being wary of the content of hacked email messages, during an appearance on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday, reports Pro Defense’s Connor O’Brien . “I don't give credence to any of these dumped documents because I don't even know if they're accurate, and they are part of an effort by the Russians and WikiLeaks,” he said.

ICYMI: PALANTIR RESPONDS TO LABOR DEPT — The tech company on Friday filed a 15-page response to allegations from the Labor Department that it systematically discriminated against Asian candidates in its hiring practices. Palantir denied the allegation and blasted the Labor Department’s 18-month analysis, saying it only focused on 3 of 44 total job titles that it hired for during that time. The Labor Department’s complaint against Palantir, filed last month, stems from what the agency says is a “neutral selection process,” when it reviews the employment and hiring data from federal government contractors. A Labor Department representative told Forbes it has not filed a complaint against another Silicon Valley contractor within the past two years.

DOES DOJ FILING SPEAK TO NEED FOR ICPA? — In a response to DOJ’s recent petition asking the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals to rehear the Microsoft case — which established that U.S. law enforcement agencies could not use warrants to obtain email data stored overseas — the legislative sponsors of the International Communications Privacy Act note that this back-and-forth further strengthens the case for advancing the bill. The Microsoft decision, in July, “emphasized the need for legislative action ‘to revise [the] badly outdated statute’ and recommended that Congress review ECPA ‘thoughtfully and dispassionately’ to ensure that it serves contemporary needs,” write Sens. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Chris Coons (D-Del.), and Reps. Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.) and Tom Marino (R-Pa.) in a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch.

— ACT | The App Association also noted that the DOJ filing reaffirmed the legislative gap that currently exists. “The Justice Department’s petition for a rehearing of the Second Circuit’s earlier unanimous decision only reinforces the need for Congress to act by passing the International Communications Privacy Act and clarifying law enforcement’s ability to access data stored abroad,” writes Morgan Reed, the ACT’s executive director. “Rather than continuing to litigate, the Justice Department should work with Congress to modernize our laws for the digital world.”
