Minister: Bersih court win leaves owners of damaged property in limbo

Datuk Abdul Rahman Dahlan says the practice of one's freedom of assembly should not infringe on the rights of others. — Picture by KE OoiKUALA LUMPUR, Aug 24 ― The Court of Appeal ruling that denied the government the right to sue for property damaged in a protest could leave landowners without legal recourse for compensation, said Datuk Abdul Rahman Dahlan.

Abdul Rahman, who is Barisan Nasional communications director and minister in the Prime Minister's Department, said the practice of one's freedom of assembly should not infringe on the rights of others.

“Orderly civil disobedience and the right to assemble are democratic rights.

“However, where does one draw the line, particularly in providing recourse for individuals or property owners who suffer damage in such instances?” he was quoted as saying yesterday by local daily The Star.

“I still believe that those responsible for assemblies should be held accountable for damage if laws on peaceful gatherings are not followed,” he said.

Abdul Rahman was weighing in on the Court of Appeal's unanimous decision yesterday that the federal government is not entitled to sue electoral reform group Bersih 2.0 for property damage during a 2012 rally.

Dismissing the government's appeal on its main claim for over RM110,543.27 in compensation from Bersih 2.0, the court found that there was no provision in the Peaceful Assembly Act 2012 that clearly stipulates the government's right to claim

The court found that Section 6(2) of the PAA did not create a statutory duty which would otherwise have created “a right of civil claim by the government” if the duty was breached, adding that the federal government was similarly not given the right to sue for negligence under the Government Proceedings Act.

The appellate court also upheld the Kuala Lumpur High Court's findings last January that the government had failed to prove its case against the Bersih 2.0 co-chairs and 13 other steering committee members.

The appellate court allowed part of the government's appeal on the counterclaim by former Bersih committee member Dr Wong Chin Huat, which meant that the government does not need to pay RM6,000 out of the RM21,000 in damages previously awarded to him for the arrest and assault on him after the rally.

Last January 30, the Kuala Lumpur High Court ruled that Bersih 2.0 was not liable for property damage during its sit-in protest on April 28, 2012, dismissing the government's claim for RM110,543.27 in property damages.

Among other things, High Court judge Datuk John Louis O'Hara had noted that the police's own actions and omissions contributed and resulted in the damage, also saying then that the damages occurred after the rally was called off and that it was not proven satisfactorily that legitimate rally participants had caused the damage.
