Rescue teams searched for survivors on Saturday after floods devastated Louisiana for several days, killing at least 13 and forcing tens of thousands of people from their homes.

Teams knocked door to door at wrecked or abandoned houses, looking for signs of survivors or bodies trapped in the debris of homes. Residents who survived piled up ruined carpets and furniture on neighborhood curbs, and people began returning to survey the damage to their homes.

Waters have receded since the rains stopped earlier this week, but the floods forced 30,000 evacuations and damaged an estimated 40,000 homes. In some areas, the waters remained high enough to keep cars submerged, and people rowed boats out to inspect their homes.

“It is devastation, absolute devastation. I mean, these homes, there are areas that have not flooded. They never flood and they flooded,” Stacey Rand, of the Louisiana fire marshal’s office, told the Associated Press. “It caught everyone by surprise.”



Many schools, daycare centers, health clinics and other public services have been damaged by the waters and are closed indefinitely. The state superintendent, John White, said 22 of Louisiana’s public schools were so heavily damaged that they would be unable to open next week for the start of school.

In Livingston Parish, where more than 2ft of rain fell in three days, as many as three-quarters of the homes were destroyed, and families were forced to shelter in cars, hotels and rescue boats. About 4,000 people were still in shelters on Saturday.

Near graveyards, people found caskets buoyed out of the earth by the floods – a yearly ritual after hurricanes sweep over Louisiana, where bodies often cannot be buried more than 6ft deep because of the high water table. East Baton Rouge reported two cemeteries with problems, and at the Plainview cemetery in Denham Springs, families found vaults collapsed and the hollow outlines of empty graves.

Resident Ravonte Thomas, whose relative’s coffin was missing from its plot, said: “It’s just bad. You can’t even come to see people. You don’t know where they’re at.”

At Livingston Parish, coroner John Marston said about 30 caskets unearthed, adding: “As the water table gets high and the ground gets saturated, it’s just like a boat. It’s going to float.”

In East Baton Rouge, where rains caused some of the worst flooding, almost 60% of the city was inundated, according to a map compiled by authorities. A local agency, the Baton Rouge Area Chamber, reported on Friday that as many as 110,000 homes were in flooded areas of the metropolitan area, including 7,300 businesses. The sheriff, Sid Gautreaux, said on Friday that the city would have a curfew from midnight to 6am ET so police can keep shelters safe and so that first responders can safely deliver supplies in the area.

Governor John Bel Edwards announced late this week that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) would help pay hotel costs for people who lack shelter, and that a disaster food stamp program would begin on Monday. On Tuesday, Barack Obama will visit the state and meet with residents and local officials, the White House said late Friday.

Some locals have criticized the president for not cutting short his vacation and visiting the state, but Edwards defended the administration’s response, saying that he has spoken with the White House daily and received help with every request he has made. Edwards said he is “not complaining in any way about our federal partnership”, and said the president would do best to visit after police had restored stability to the area and could safely provide security again.

Also on Friday, Republican nominee Donald Trump briefly visited the state, lingering for about 15 minutes with a crowd of supporters in St Amant before his motorcade left for the campaign trail.
