Iran said Sunday that it had arrested a person involved in the negotiations of its nuclear deal with six world powers last year and accused him of spying.

An Iranian judiciary spokesman, Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejehi, said the accused was detained and released on bail after a few days, but didn't identify him by name.

The spokesman also didn't say when the arrest occurred, which country the person was accused of spying for or what sensitive information he may have disclosed.

"If this charge?is proved or not is another matter, because there is a difference between pursuing someone on a warrant and the charge being proved," Mr. Ejehi said, according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency.

While details were scarce, the arrest is an unexpected turn of events in the wake of a nuclear deal that was hailed by its proponents as a springboard for friendlier relations between Iran and the world.

Under the deal last July, Iran agreed to scale back its disputed nuclear program in exchange for relief from international sanctions that crippled its economy. The deal formally took effect in January.

Reports by hard-line Iranian news outlets said last week that Abdolrasoul Dori-Esfahani, a financial expert who played a role in the nuclear talks, had been detained on suspicion of espionage. Tehran's top prosecutor also said this month that an Iranian dual-national had been arrested and accused of having contacts with British intelligence.

It was unclear if those cases were related, and efforts to reach Mr. Dori-Esfahani were unsuccessful. The U.K. said earlier this month that it was seeking more information on the case involving British intelligence.

While proponents of the nuclear deal hope it will help improve long-strained U.S.-Iran ties, its opponents say Iran has continued with its disruptive behavior in the Middle East despite the diplomacy, funneling support to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Hezbollah in Lebanon, one of Israel's most formidable foes.

The U.S. Navy said last week that Iranian boats twice made dangerous approaches to American craft in the Persian Gulf, ignoring their radio communications. Iranian officials responded by asserting the country's dominance over the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, the critical shipping channel at its outlet to the Gulf of Oman.

Confrontations between U.S. and Iranian vessels in the Persian Gulf have long been a common occurrence.
