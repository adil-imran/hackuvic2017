A hacked email leaked by WikiLeaks on Tuesday showed the "first cut of people" Hillary Clinton's campaign had considered for her vice presidential running mate. In March, campaign chairman John Podesta sent Clinton the short list of 39 potential candidates, which included a number of successful businesspeople. Below are the nine big business names selected and their experiences with leadership that may have contributed to why they made the list: View As: One Page Slides

Mary Barra In 2014, Barra took over as GM's chief executive in the midst of a crisis: fresh off a recession that saw bankruptcy and bailouts for the automaker, Barra led GM through a recall of 30 million cars with faulty ignitions to finishing out the year with record sales. Under her tenure, GM has continued to dominate. The reason for GM's success: "We have total leadership alignment in the company," Vice President Mark Reuss — the No. 2 guy with CEO Mary Barra and the executive responsible for guiding GM's vehicle development — previously told Business Insider. And Barra's sights aren't set simply on changing the auto industry — she speaks about changing the world. "If you truly want to 'change the world,' you need more than talent. You also need to do the work, because hard work beats talent if talent doesn't work hard," she said during Stanford Graduate School of Business's commencement ceremony.

Michael Bloomberg As the founder, owner, and CEO of Bloomberg LP, founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies, and former mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg more than 30 years' cumulative leadership experience. During his tenure as mayor between 2002 and 2013, he worked with Hillary Clinton, who served as a US senator for New York between 2001 and 2009. The two have also joined forces in the past to promote women's rights initiatives. Though Bloomberg, who registered as an independent in 2007, had considered joining the presidential race on a third-party platform, he wrote in March that he could not run "in good conscience" because his candidacy could lead to the election of Donald Trump or Senator Ted Cruz. During a speech given at the Democratic National Convention in July, Bloomberg said, "Trump is a risky, reckless, and radical choice, and we can't afford to make that choice." While he acknowledged that he and Hillary Clinton disagreed on numerous issues, he went on to endorse Clinton as the "responsible choice in this election" and a "sane," "competent" candidate.

Ursula Burns The CEO of Xerox has proven she isn't afraid of tackling challenges. Around 2000, when Xerox was on the brink of bankruptcy, she turned down the severance package offered to her and other executives in favor of helping to keep the company afloat. As Business Insider previously reported, Burns considers the experience of those crisis years to be "the best experience ever" because she was required to make decisions rapidly and respond to tensions as quickly as possible. "I don't think I could have been trained better at business school," she told the audience at a 92Y event in New York last year.

Tim Cook The role of vice president is nothing new for Tim Cook — he served as Apple's Senior Vice President for worldwide operations under the helm of Steve Jobs. Now as the leader of the most valuable company in the world, Cook has experience successfully filling some big shoes. As Business Insider previously reported, it's unknown whether Cook is a Republican or a Democrat. But Cook hosted a fundraiser for Clinton in August and has taken public stances on issues like gay rights and climate change that more closely align with those of Hillary Clinton's campaign.

Bill Gates Apart from starting a computer revolution in the 1980s, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates is also a renowned leader in efforts to fight global poverty and disease. In his capacity as co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which he founded in 2010 with his wife Melinda Gates, he has spoken and written publicly about the importance of foreign assistance programs to US national and economic security. The Clinton Global Initiative, an initiative of the Clinton Foundation, for which Hillary Clinton served as a board member from 2013 to 2015, brings together world and business leaders to discuss solutions to the global issues. The two families have worked together in the past to boost foreign aid in the fight against HIV and AIDS. In a blog post this month, Bill Gates says that developing a vaccine for HIV and a cure for neurodegenerative diseases is an objective the next US president should prioritize over the next decade. According to Hillary Clinton's campaign website, the presidential nominee pledges to "invest in research to end HIV and AIDS" and "increase the number of people on HIV treatment worldwide." "In terms of experience, Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton have more experience on global health," Gates told STAT News in June.

Melinda Gates As co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Melinda Gates is one of the most powerful female philanthropists in the world, and she's particularly devoted to in investing in women. As Business Insider previously reported, at the forefront of Melinda Gates' agenda is expanding the availability of contraception and, most recently, bringing awareness to the concept of time poverty — the notion that hours of daily unpaid work like household chores end up "robbing women of their potential." "When you invest in women, you invest in the people who invest in everybody else," she wrote in a Fortune article last year outlining the benefits of hiring women in business. "And if you gradually start to take action, it won’t be long before you realize that investing in women is good for your mind, good for your soul, and good for your business." Hillary Clinton has said she is proud to "play the gender card" during her campaign and vowed to work to close the gender pay gap and fight for paid family leave, among other things.

Muhtar Kent Muhtar Kent worked his way up through a variety of marketing and operations leadership positions at Coca-Cola to become its chairman of the board and CEO in 2009. The business leader has written several blog posts about human rights issues, including access to safe, clean drinking water and the importance of supporting women's entrepreneurship, both issues Hillary Clinton has spoken to.
