Chandigarh, Jan 8: Banking operations were partially hit in Punjab and Haryana after a section of public sector banks’ employees went on a one-day nationwide strike to protest service rules in associate banks of SBI. Banking services like cash handling at branch level and clearing of cheques were affected in the banks. However, private sector banks and State Bank of India (SBI) functioned normally.

Bank employees held protest rallies at various places, including Ludhiana and Nawanshahar. While addressing the bank employees in Ludhiana, leaders of the Punjab Bank Employees Federation said that there have been attempts to adversely and unilaterally amend the service conditions of the employees in the associate banks. “Right of collective bargaining is one of the most significant achievement of AIBEA and it is a hallmark of our glorious movement.

“But SBI management wants to crush and trample under foot this basic right of the trade union. Our service conditions in the associate banks have been achieved by AIBEA and governed through the industry-level bipartite settlements as well as by our internal settlement through SSBEA/Bankwise Unions. “Today, SBI management wants to ignore and negate these settled service conditions and wants to impose the SBI service conditions which are not acceptable to the employees in the associate banks,” said Federation’s Secretary Naresh Gaur.

He further said that housing loan limits for staff have been increased in every other bank, but not in the associate banks. “Due to the efforts of prolonged agitation by AIBEA/UFBU, a revised ‘Compassionate grounds Appointments Scheme’ on the lines of Central government scheme has been approved by the government for implementation in all the public sector banks from Aug 5, 2014. “But till today, this Scheme has not been placed before the Board in the Associate Banks. “On the other hand, despite protests from our unions, a different scheme denying compassionate appointments and providing ex gratia amount has been introduced by the associate banks,” he added.
