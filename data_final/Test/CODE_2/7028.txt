A cabinet minister has expressed no confidence in the Government's plan for securing the release of Ibrahim Halawa.

Children's Minister Katherine Zappone called for an urgent reassessment of the strategy adopted by Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan.

Her comments came as the 20-year-old Dubliner's trial was adjourned by an Egyptian court for the 14th time in three years. Mr Flanagan has resisted calls for Ireland to seek a presidential pardon for Mr Halawa, who faces an attempted murder charge and a potential death penalty after being arrested in Cairo during protests against the ousting of former Egyptian leader Mohamed Morsi.

The minister has advocated a "firm and measured diplomatic approach" and claims it would be unrealistic to expect Mr Halawa to be released before the judicial process ends. However, his strategy has now been openly questioned by Independent Cabinet minister Zappone, in whose constituency the Halawa family live.

"I firmly believe that securing Ibrahim's freedom must be the priority and I am asking my Government colleagues to carry out an urgent review of the current strategy which to date has failed to secure that goal," she said in a statement. "I share the very real concerns of the Halawa family and their supporters, as well as human rights organisations about Ibrahim's mental and physical well-being."

It was unclear last night whether her comments had forced any rethink in approach by the Department of Foreign Affairs. Australian journalist Peter Greste, who previously shared a prison cell with Mr Halawa, yesterday urged the Government to seek a presidential decree, which was used to secure his freedom. Verdicts had been expected yesterday in the mass trial involving Mr Halawa and 490 other defendants.

However, the court ordered a review of technical evidence, involving a reassessment of video footage, and adjourned proceedings until October 2. The news was greeted with concern by the Dubliner's family and Mr Flanagan.

The minister said he would be conveying his concerns about the latest delay to the Egyptian government and would be seeking more information on the review of technical evidence and its likely impact on the trial. Mr Halawa's sister Somaia said the family was "devastated" by the adjournment, describing it as "deeply troubling".
