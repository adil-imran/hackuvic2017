CEBU, Philippines - A barangay councilman was arrested with at least P118,000 worth of shabu in Barangay Singsing, Balamban town yesterday morning.

Police identified the suspect as Higatmonan barangay councilman Francis Eric Dacua, 39, who has a house in the nearby Barangay Singsing.

Prior to the operation, Dacua was placed under weeks of surveillance, according to Senior Inspector Ramil Morpos, chief of Balamban Police Station.

Morpos said that after validating the suspect's involvement in the illegal drug trade, they applied for a search warrant.

Judge Ruben Altubar of the Regional Trial Court Branch 29 issued a search warrant against the suspect for violation of sections 11 (possession of illegal drugs) and 12 (possession of drug paraphernalia) of Republic Act 9165 ot the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.

Dacua chairs the barangay peace and order council.

He reportedly attempted to escape during the operation, but was eventually cornered by the police.

Evidence recovered from him were a medium-size and 10 sachets of suspected shabu weighing 10 grams and worth P118,000 as per Dangerous Drugs Board estimates.

Drug paraphernalia and a cal. 357 revolver with ammunition were also recovered from the barangay official.

Morpos said Dacua denied the accusation against him, reasoning out that the shabu seized from his possession was for his own consumption.

However, Morpos said they have earlier received information that Dacua is engaged in the illegal drug trade and that he gets his supply of drugs from Cebu City.

The barangay official is now detained pending the filing of complaints before the prosecutor's office.

Arrested in Cebu City

Another alleged drug pusher was arrested in a buy-bust operation yesterday dawn in Barangay Pari-an, Cebu City.

Arrested was Richard Wong, who claimed that he was only framed by a friend.

Aside from the pack of shabu Wong reportedly sold to the poseur-buyer, four more packs of suspected shabu were confiscated from him.

Police said the suspect is known for his illegal drug trade in the area and is in fact on their drug watchlist.

But according to Wong, the drugs were not his and that he was only framed by his friend.

"Di man to akoa sir, nikuyog ra man ko, akong kuyog si Tyrone. Akong amigo naay contact nga bayot, mao 'to iyang gihatdan og shabu, kuyog ra ko. Bali akoy gi-frame," he insisted.

He further alleged that he was only manning his mother's sari-sari store in the area and is not into selling shabu.

Police said the operation was consummated, leading to the suspect's arrest.

In another operation in the same barangay, police also arrested Dennis Reyes, 39, and Reynaldo Mongaya, 48, who allegedly yielded three ampoules of Nubain.

All suspects are now detained at the Pari-an Police Station and will face drug charges. â€” Mylen P. Manto and Mae Clydyl L. Avila (FREEMAN)
