The intervention of the NEC follows a string of similar interventions ranging from President Jacob Zuma to the cabinet and the ANC in Parliament after the Supreme Court of Appeal judgment which ruled against Motsoeneng’s appointment as chief operations officer at the SABC.

Cape Town - Hlaudi Motsoeneng’s days at the SABC appear to be numbered after the ANC’s top decision-making body, the National Executive Committee (NEC) ordered the SABC Board to fire him.

But Motsoeneng and the SABC board have refused to heed the call for him to get the sack.

The call by the NEC on Monday comes a day before the SABC board meets with the portfolio committee on communications in Parliament on his illegal appointment. He was appointed to a new position without due processes followed, the ANC said in Parliament last week.

ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said on Monday the NEC discussed the Motsoeneng matter at the weekend. Motsoeneng had had his salary increased from R3.7 million to R4.1m per annum despite the SABC losing hundreds of millions of rand.

The SABC suffered its third annual consecutive loss, yet Motsoeneng was rewarded with a bonus of R11.4m and another R33m in bonus payment is on the way.

Mantashe said they had serious discussions about the SABC.“On the SABC, the NEC called for the board of the corporation to review the decision to appoint Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng as group executive for Corporate Affairs,” said Mantashe. “The NEC also agreed on the need for a parliamentary inquiry into the board’s fitness to hold office."

The portfolio committee is expected to raise the issue of the inquiry when it meets with the SABC board on Wednesday.

ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu said last week the meeting with the board was an urgent matter to deal with the issue of defying the courts and appointing Motsoeneng illegally.

The defiance of Motsoeneng and the SABC board has been met with fury across the state and Parliament.

The cabinet directed Communications Minister Faith Muthambi to tell the board to rescind its decision on Motsoeneng, and she is expected to report to the cabinet soon.

Zuma had also called on Motsoeneng to respect the SCA decision and not trample on it.

Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe said the SABC must stop being a law unto itself and must begin to respect decisions of the courts as final arbiters.

He said the courts derive their powers from the constitution, and the SABC cannot defy the supreme law of the land.
