NEW DELHI: At the first meeting of Project Vishwajeet- the HRD ministry mission to catapult seven IITs into top global academic rankings- it has been agreed that five state of the art research laboratories will be set up to match international facilities. Internationalization of the seven IITs is the other key part of the projectâ€”one of the parameters where Indian institutes typically lag behind on global academic rankings.As part of Project Vishwajeet , special focus and funding will be granted to seven IITs in namely Delhi, Bombay, Kanpur, Kharagpur, Madras, Roorkee and Guwahati.The IITs, however, have expressed that Project Vishwajeet should be more about bringing a major quality upgrade at IITs than about focusing just on global rankings. Each institution would select 5 areas where they have inherent strength but require world class lab to compete at the global level. They will be funded by providing additional plan grantsOn the larger aim to globalize IITs- on the anvil are plans to fill 20 per cent vacancies with foreign faculty, allow off campus PhD students, 20% international students at undergraduate and postgraduate level, a 1:7 faculty-student ratio and separate capital grants for world class infrastructure.The Government is already working out modalities to ease up visa procedures for recruitment of foreign faculty at IITs. It is envisaged that 20% of all fresh recruitment shall be foreign faculty and by 2020. Special effort will be made to identify Indian students doing research in the top 100 institutions of the World. It is envisaged that 20% International students at doctoral and graduate levels and at least 20% of all M Tech, PhD students shall be offered as supernumerary positions for foreign students.It is also agreed that the GATE exam should be aggressively conducted overseas to draw more foreign students. To push up global collaborations, it is proposed that at least 10% of the total research projects taken up shall be joint research projects with foreign universities in the top 100 universities in the World.Academic leaders teaching in top-100 universities may be requested to accept the position of Distinguished International Professor (DIP) so that they can teach a semester in the IIT for the next 3 years.It is expected that each of these institutions shall build a corpus fund of Rs. 500 Cr by April 2018, and Rs. 1,000 Cr by April 2021 through alumni contributions, corporate donations and CSR funds. The student fee would be fixed by the institute BoG and any marginal addition to the corpus fund will be matched by the Centre from plan funds.The IITs have also indicated to the Prakash Javadekar led HRD ministry that they would prefer to expand intake in post graduate courses and research areas rather than at the undergraduate level. The seven IITs will increase seats by 20% at the M Tech level to focus on research. A teacher student ratio of 1:10 instead of the current 1:15 is also planned to ensure better attention to students. The larger aim, however, is a 1:7 teacher student ratio.
