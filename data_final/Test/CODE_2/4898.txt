The Kano State chapter of Aninri Local Government Union yesterday raised the alarm over alleged plots to remove their son, Senator Ike Ekweremadu as Deputy Senate President.

Senator Ekweremadu’s kinsmen feared that a group of powerful politicians have perfected plans to unseat him, describing the move as act of injustice to Ndigbo.

In a Press statement signed by Chief Moses Odi and Mr. Gabriel Aniude, President-General and Secretary-General of the Union, the union noted that recent political attacks on Senator Ekweremadu is a clear indication that some powerful people are gunning for his seat.

The statement further described Ekweremadu as “a true son of Aninri and good ambassador of Ndigbo who needs the sympathy and support of all Igbo sons and daughters. From every calculation, there is no gainsaying the fact that Senator Ekweremadu remains a beckon of hope to the political emancipation the Igbo race and Nigeria at large.”

The statement further stated: “Going by Senator Ekweremadu’s rising political profile; enemies of democracy who have foreseen his fortunes and prospects have now resorted to cheap blackmail, back-biting and name-calling all in their bid to run him down.”

The statement also frowned at recent comments credited to Imo State Governor, Owelle Rochas Okorocha on plans by the All Progressive Congress senator from Imo State to take over Senator Ekweremadu’s seat as Deputy Senate President.

“In as much as it is not a crime for a political godfather to secure job for his godson, we the kinsmen of Ike Ekweremadu frown at such comment coming from a highly respected Igbo son in the person of Owelle Rochas Okorocha.

“We have taken time to analyze Owelle Rochas Okorocha’s latest comments and attack on Senator Ike Ekweremadu; and we have come to the conclusion that such disrespectful comments were weaved to run down the political career of the Deputy Senate President.”
