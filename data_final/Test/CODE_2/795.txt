The wetlands trail in the Codroy Valley is a remarkable natural wonder on the southwest coast.

But it's a little off the beaten path for visitors to the area.

Thanks to the work of the Nature Conservancy of Canada, however, anyone in the world will soon be able to experience the trail from the comfort of their own home.

Luc Thomas works in the NCC's communications department, looking after the organization's website.

But recently, Thomas has been travelling the country and capturing images of NCC protected areas.

In itself, that's not unusual, but Thomas is using an unusual camera.

Partnering with Google, the NCC has been using a special rig with 15 cameras to capture 360-degree views of protected areas.

The tech giant calls the rig the Trekker. It's a portable version of the camera rig they use on vehicles for the Street View feature on Google Maps.

Thomas said the NCC reached out to Google about a partnership, and last year the Trekker went to some protected areas in various parts of Canada.

"It's a fantastic opportunity to travel the country," Thomas said.

This summer, Thomas brought it east and has been visiting areas in Atlantic Canada. Earlier this week, the Trekker was brought to Maddox Cove on the Avalon Peninsula.

On Thursday, Thomas and NCC conservation biologist made their way to the Codroy Valley and the Grand Codroy estuary.

The NCC has been trying to get the Trekker to every province.

NCC conservation biologist Megan Lafferty accompanied Thomas.

Lafferty said the NCC is trying to connect with Canadians through this project.

Thomas has been travelling with the Trekker across Canada, but at every stop he's shared the load with local NCC staff.

He said the training to use the camera takes about two hours, and then it's just a matter of taking the 50-pound rig out into the world.

"The biggest challenge is some of the tougher inclines," Thomas said. "You have to be very conscious of your footing."

Lafferty said when she took a turn with the Trekker at Maddox Cove, she had one moment where she slipped a bit on a rocky slope. Fortunately both she and the camera were fine.

"I thought 'Gee, I'm glad I didn't take a tumble,' " she said.

Lafferty said the Trekker attracts interest from other hikers, but she noticed a generational gap in terms of how that interest is shown.

According to Lafferty, some hikers know immediately what the rig is and will approach. Others stop and stare at it.

But she said everyone is curious.

The physical work is done in the Codroy Valley, but Lafferty said the technical side will take some time.

She said the images are collected on a disk and given to Google, where all the images are stitched together to create a virtual representation of the wetlands trail.

Unfortunately, the public will have to wait a year to see those images. Lafferty said the areas captured by the Trekker last year will soon be available online, and hopefully by next summer the Codroy Valley trail and other areas will be available next summer.

Thomas said the NCC will profile all the sites on the organization's website.
