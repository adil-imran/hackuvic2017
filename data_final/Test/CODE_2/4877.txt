Not fully holding breath at this time.

Julian had fun with us just last week.

O’Keefe has never really topped his first big reveal about Acorn. Unfortunately, he could have some hot stuff, and either the media decides to ignore it, or law enforcement decides the same thing. We are slip sliding away as a law and order republic.



To: TheRef

Obozo is gonna launch the “Cyber War” against Putin and it will take out the internet...two birds, one stone. No O’Keefe vids on the net... no more wikileaks, no anonymous.

Very very silly. If something really exists release it without the fanfare and tease. Otherwise just dopey attention seeking posturing.



To: TheRef

Clintoon will say it’s fake and her retarded turds in the national “media” will repeat, “Yeah, it’s fake!”

I totally agree... Why wait???? Get it out NOW



To: micmac

Releasing a story on a Friday night is called “burying it”.

Even if true few people will hear about it.The usual suspects in the press will give any knockout blow against Hillary a good leaving alone.



To: Bobalu

You better pray its “Cyber”. Obozo is desperate. If he tries to kill one Russian soldier in Syria , you better have food , fuel water and ammo!!

To: Bobalu

Do you think this cyber war deal Obama may launch would give him an excuse to declare National Emergency and cancel or postpone the election???

James. Learn a lesson from Breitbart. Release it now!

I think there is little doubt that hype can actually help a story get coverage. He worked with Andrew Breitbart, learned from the best. Read through all the posts and you’ll see that he plants to feed a little at a time on big networks. It builds to a crescendo. Political people love the drama.



To: TheRef

These people love “next week”. Release it yesterday.

Yup. James didn’t need publicity stunts for his earlier works. Why now?

Debate is Wednesday.

To: Gay State Conservative

It’s good to remember that while the media HATES Trump, they also don’t like Hillary much either. If this is as juicy as O’Keefe says, and looks like it will amp ratings and sell papers, it’ll play.



To: JBW1949

I think almost anything is possible with this bunch in charge.

To: TheRef

Why is the next big “devastating” reveal” always coming “soon” ? Are the likes of O’Keefe and Assange just plants?

great post..!



To: TheRef

Then he should’ve learned the biggest lesson he could’ve from Breitbart. Either it’s going to be little, or he’s got a toetag in his immediate future.



To: TheRef

It’d be nice, but early voting has already been underway for days in many areas. In an election cycle like this, waiting until late October is probably waiting too long.



To: Bobalu

Would not surprise me in the least....

To: gaijin

thanks



To: seacapn

I think most of the early vote is set. If they’re unsure, they’re probably not early voting.



To: JennysCool

...they also dont like Hillary much either. Can't agree with you there.It's the American people who hate her.Paul Krugman,Chris Matthews and others get a thrill in a place I won't mention when they hear her name.



To: JBW1949

Don’t get crazy eyes waiting for this stuff. If you read this, James clearly spells out his plans for release. It’s being done intentionally. Just wait and see.



To: TheRef

When deciding to release devastating information about the Clintons, sooner rather than later is best. The worst thing one could do is talk about it beforehand, then wait to make it public. There is a large variety of ‘accidents’ that could befall such an individual in the meantime and render the entire thing moot. Does he know who he’s dealing with here?

Not fully holding breath at this time. Yeah, Biden is on TV saying the kenyan “may” cyber attack Russia. That’s not exactly top secret info that this point. LOL.



by 29 posted onby lodi90 (Clear choice for Conservatives now: TRUMP or lose)

To: Gay State Conservative

While they push Her Majesty, it’s only because she’s the Dem nominee, not because they have any great love for her. She has long treated the media like crap. If the choice is between saving Hillary’s ample behind or a billion dollars worth of ratings gold, I’m guessing they happily go with the money and salivate at all the fun they’ll have tearing down Trump for the next four years.



To: Deo volente

Yes, he says he has a plan for the release of this stuff even if he doesn’t survive to do it.



To: seacapn

I would disagree. The majority votes on election day. One could also argue that early voters are pretty solid on their choice, so these released might not have the same effect as others.



To: Bobalu

I read the announcement about the covert cyber attack. Like Trump says, Obama has to announce everything.



To: Deo volente

It’s announced so that it will gain maximum coverage and viewers.



To: lee martell

The whole thing seems odd to me. He says he is releasing it to Mainstream networks hard to believe that the MSM would air something not flattering to Hillary. I think they are pulling his chain or some one is pulling someones chain.

I’m sure it’s Fox News, maybe Newsmas or the Blaze for smaller revelations. All three can get it into the bloodstream, but FNC would be best. I only say those other two because he referenced multiple places, so you got me. Maybe Animal Planet, half their shows have nothing to do with animals anyway, so why not a little Project Veritas action!



To: Bobalu

Didn’t I read very recently that Russia has called for its people to come home from foreign lands, or something like that?



To: TheRef

Media ignores everything he does. The media is corrupt, like they are are in 3rd world dictatorships

To: funfan

Yesm it sounds funny. Plus, why would O’Keefe telegraph his punch in such great detail? Does he wish to gode someone into a misstep? This may be the cyber equivalent of Saber Rattling. It also doesn’t sound like the Knockout Punch we desperately need.



To: TheRef

Miss Breitbart so much. Miss Hitchens, too. Hitchens hated Hillary. I’m SURE he wouldn’t have been a Trump supporter, but he would have given his unvarnished opinion on the Clintons.



To: TheRef

Stay safe O’Keefe.

To: lodi90

The cyber attack may be a pretext to block more Assange leaks as well as Project Veritas. O’Keefe always delivers.



To: hoosiermama

James. Learn a lesson from Breitbart. Release it now! In the linked conversation, James said he knew Breitbart very well, knew he had a heart condition, and knew he barely slept. James further said the Breitbart video was in fact released several days after Breitbart's death. James does not see anything suspicious in Breitbart's death.

To: Bobalu

You didn't read the article, of course. He has the tapes embargoed with mainstream TV stations that WILL release.

To: Deo volente

Read the thread. The information is already embargoed with major TV stations which *will* release it, and there is already a dead-man's switch. Given how the leftists talk among each other, and how they have openly given debate questions in advance to Hillary during the Bernie debates; given the "Correct the Record" having 372 major talking head and over 2,000 local reporters subscribing to their email feed with regular talking points on specific subject areas, I'm sure the *content* of the tapes is already known to top Democrats -- the more so as it is claimed they are *participants*. IF true, this would explain the desperate full-court-press 24x7 on the fake sex accusations, to buffalo Trump out of the race before it hits, and second, the defeated sound and look on Bill Clinton's face (really, remember "Slick Willie?" did he EVER use openly insulting terms like "redneck" on a hot mic with the camera live before), and defeated tone of Obama talking about crazy conspiracy theories. And without the jaunty lilt of his pre-first-election of "a President that doesn't look like the founding fathers" or "we are five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America". And it's just the "Bill Clinton is a RAPIST" t-shirts. And they are not angrily posturing and disputing the point, they are now just shouting "Look, SQUIRREL" and literally saber-rattling for a war with Russia. (Romney and before her, Sarah Palin, deserved better, even if it was Romeny's stooge Steve Schmidt who stabbed Sarah in the back.) The Russians can see Hillary from her server. And now we all can.
