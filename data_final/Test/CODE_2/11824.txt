Zimbabwe People First (ZPF) leader Joice Mujuru, who has come under intense attacks from Zanu-PF, has threatened to "expose" President Robert Mugabe and "revisionists" in her former party whom she accuses of trying to rewrite history.

Mujuru has become a subject of Zanu-PF relentless attacks after she held joint rallies with MDC president Morgan Tsvangirai in Gweru last week.

Yesterday, Mugabe's spokesperson George Charamba said Mujuru should zip up and stop provoking history by belittling the role that the veteran Zanu-PF leader played during the country's liberation struggle.

This was after Mujuru claimed her late husband - Solomon "Rex Nhongo" Mujuru - catapulted Mugabe to the leadership of Zanu during the liberation struggle in Mozambique.

"The history of this country should not revolve around Mugabe, what Charamba and other apologists call history is not history at all," said Mujuru, in a statement issued on her behalf by the party's spokesperson, Jealousy Mawarire.

"We have a lot of people who have done a lot for this country and need recognition; we are not saying Mugabe has not done anything because we are in the current status because of his misrule.

"He is responsible for all the bad things that have affected this country, Charamba wants to celebrate Mugabe's stay in Ghana, but the truth of the matter is that Mugabe's return from Ghana was far from glorious, he was not an ally of Kwame Nkrumah, he is a selfish leader, he was never a socialist," said Mawarire.

In his autobiography, respected Zanu-PF elder Cephas Msipa, who accommodated Mugabe upon his return from Ghana in 1960, insinuates that the 92-year-old strongman, left the west African country under unclear and not-so-rosy circumstances.

"Mugabe supported the idea of a one-party State back then, but did not much about his personal experiences in Ghana. It was as if something had gone wrong while he was in Ghana, which he did not disclose," Msipa said in his book.

Mujuru served as Mugabe's deputy for 10 years and was expelled from the ruling party in 2014 on untested allegations of trying to kill the nonagenarian.

Mawarire said Mugabe should not be treated as super hero.

"He is not a trained soldier and he should not be treated as a superhero, if anything the history that Charamba wants to rewrite is something that was happening from where Charamba was, he himself should tell us whether he was part of (Abel) Muzorewa he cannot dispute Mujuru's account of history, how old was he in 1970," questioned Mawarire.

On Monday, the State media launched a savage propaganda blitzkrieg against Mujuru and tried to soil the political legacy of her immensely-popular husband Rex - whom they blamed for working with Tsvangirai during his time in Zanu-PF.

Rex, Zimbabwe's first black army commander, who was seen as a kingmaker within the warring Zanu-PF, and who is credited with playing a major role in catapulting Mugabe to the leadership of the ruling party in the mid 1970s, died in a mysterious fire at his Beatrice farmhouse, just outside Harare, in August 2011.
