David Ritchie Marius Fransman

UNDER-FIRE ANC provincial chairman Marius Fransman has approached the Western Cape High Court, seeking a copy of the party's integrity committee report into allegations he had sexually harassed a 21-year-old Stellenbosch woman.

Two weeks ago, the committee's report was leaked to a Sunday newspaper. It reportedly found Fransman’s actions had brought the ANC into disrepute, that he immediately relinquish all his elected positions and not be eligible as a public representative of the ANC, and that the decision be reviewed after two years.

In February, the ANC’s national working committee had asked that Fransman “step aside” while the committee probed his conduct.

Last week, while President Jacob Zuma was campaigning for the ANC in Cape Town’s townships, Fransman was by his side.

ANC national executive committee member Nomvula Mokonyane, quizzed about Fransman’s presence, declared he was back as provincial chairman.

Asked for clarification, ANC spokesman Khusela Sangoni said Fransman had not yet been cleared, and the integrity committee's recommendations had been sent to the party's national disciplinary committee to probe possible charges against him.

But yesterday, Fransman demanded that the committee release its report to him.

“Having expended every possible comradely option to ensure that the time-honoured ANC ethos is preserved and promoted in the ongoing consideration of an harassment accusal against me, a media statement earlier today, by Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe, forced me to defer to the injunction of my legal team to ensure compliance by approaching the Western Cape High Court today to ensure I receive the Integrity Commission report and to secure my constitutional rights to fair procedure (sic),” said Fransman in a statement.

He was referring to a news report in which Mantashe reaffirmed that his suspension was still valid, adding that Mokonyane had been “under pressure” when she declared he had been cleared.

But Fransman said: “It is outrageous that the SG (Mantashe) should publicly attack and question the president and the head of elections days before a critical election. The office of the president deserves respect.”

He said despite the ANC’s internal protocols, Mantashe had communicated “mostly” through the media.

He insisted that he had not been suspended.

“I am elected by a properly constituted conference and have both the duty and the right to campaign for the benefit of the ANC, and so also to demonstrate and promote my own political, leadership, and professional standing,” said Fransman.

But ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa said: "He is not back in the position, the ANC has an acting chairman in the Western Cape. "We will challenge it and defend ourselves," he added.

Kodwa confirmed remarks by Mantashe that Fransman imposed himself at campaign events last week and embarrassed ANC elections head Mokonyane into telling reporters he was back in the fold to save face.

Asked for comment, Mantashe said the ANC did not want to be side-tracked by Fransman more than a week before the local government elections.
