Student nurses, midwives and other health professionals will march outside Whitehall and Downing Street on Saturday in protest against the government’s plan to scrap bursaries for nursing and midwifery students from 2017.

The march, organised by students at King’s College London, will be the second time students gather to challenge the plans. On 2 December, more than 500 students, healthcare professionals and members of the public attended a demo near the Department of Health. A petition against the measures has garnered over 150,000 signatures, triggering a parliamentary debate on 11 January, and the campaign hashtag #BursaryorBust has gained traction on social media.

“To think that the opportunity I had is going to be taken from prospective nurses, who like me, just want to help people, means I can’t not fight for them,” says Marina Down, 22, a single mum and student mental health nurse at King’s College London, who will speaking at the march. “I wouldn’t be able to study were it not for my bursary.”

Student nurses, midwives and allied health professionals, including occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, podiatrists and radiographers, currently don’t pay tuition fees. They receive a mixture of a non-means tested bursary, a means-tested bursary and a reduced rate student loan to help with their living costs. The government-funded Health Education England (HEE) decides how many student places are available each year.

However the chancellor’s plan, first outlined in November, will see the bursary replaced by loans in England to cover tuition fees and maintenance costs. The government claims this will allow the cap on student numbers of be lifted, creating up to 10,000 extra training places this parliament.

The government also says students will be able to receive 25% more financial support during their studies as a result of the change.

But many in the sector, such as Dr Carol Hall, director of undergraduate education for the school of health sciences at the University of Nottingham, point out that nursing and midwifery students are far less able than other students to undertake part-time work to support themselves financially while studying, as they must work long hours unpaid on clinical placements. Students are also less able to work part-time during the holidays because of this.

Long-term, student nurses could start their careers with around £50,000 worth of debt, and student midwives with over £60,000 worth, which they will still be paying back in 2050. Because the majority of these graduates will go on to work for the NHS, their earning potential at graduation is fixed at below average, and rounding off a bleak picture, these roles have been subjected to pay freezes for the last few years.

The Royal College of Nursing (RCN), the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) and the unions Unite and Unison are concerned that this could discourage students from poorer backgrounds who would otherwise make talented health professionals.

Danielle Tiplady, 29, a student nurse at King’s College London who organised Saturday’s protest, is from a low-income background and says she probably wouldn’t have applied for her course without a bursary. “To take out a massive loan to work [on a placement] is not attractive. I’ve already had so many people say to me that they won’t do it now because it’s too daunting.”

Tiplady points out that the proposals could mean students end up effectively paying to work for the NHS on their placements.

“You come into it because you care and want to help people, but now the only people who will be able to do it are the ones who can afford it,” she adds.



For others from similar backgrounds, such as Sarah Baker, 20, a midwifery student at the University of Leeds, the NHS bursary opened up a world of opportunities. If the bursary hadn’t existed a few years ago, Baker says she may not have been able to complete the course.



“I wouldn’t have been able to move away from home to university like I have,” she adds. “I would have been restricted to applying to universities closer to home so I could commute.”

A large proportion of those doing nursing and midwifery degrees are mature students with families to support and those with previous degrees. The average age of a nursing student is 29, according to the RCN, and it’s feared that the abolition of the NHS bursary may discourage such students from pursuing these careers, especially when the costs of housing and childcare are already so high.



“Mature applicants bring a depth of knowledge and experience to their student nursing and midwifery roles that we would not want to lose,” says Professor Angela Simpson, head of nursing, midwifery and professional education at the University of York.

Down, 22, who fell pregnant at 16, says: “It would be much easier financially for me to not pursue my nursing dreams, as the cost of childcare, living in London, doing shifts and essays all take their toll.



“However, because I have the lifeline of a bursary, I’m able to better myself, pursue a career doing something I love and set an example to my daughter.”

A survey by the RCM of its student members found that a third of students were already graduates when they began midwifery training, and three-quarters of those had borrowed money when they studied for their first degree. The changes could mean prospective applicants choose to avoid increasing their debt.

One such student is Sophie Johnson (not her real name), 24, who is doing midwifery in London. She says the bursary has been essential because, having previously completed a social science degree, she is already in debt.

“I couldn’t have afforded to do this training if I didn’t get the bursary every month,” she says. “It isn’t enough to cover everything, let alone have money for myself, but it is a huge help.”

The prospect of lifting the cap on student numbers doesn’t impress current students. Many say their courses are already short-staffed and doubt their universities would be able to cope.

Louise Williamson, 21, a student nurse at the University of Liverpool, says: “I’ve heard from students [at one university] who say there have 300 people in their course, and they don’t get anywhere near the support they expected. Healthcare students don’t just need help with being taught, they also need the emotional support of tutors on placements, and would benefit from more one-to-one attention. That probably wouldn’t happen if the number of students increased.”

And what about the next generation of health professionals? How are the measures likely to go down with current sixth-form students and others aspiring to become nurses and midwives?



Many universities say it’s too early to know what impact the changes will have on the number of students applying for their nursing and midwifery courses – which tend to be oversubscribed and highly competitive – but say that in all likelihood the numbers will remain stable.

Professor Simpson points out that the increase in tuition fees for other courses didn’t result in a drastic fall in the number of applicants applying to university, even among those from poorer backgrounds. She says there’s no reason to suggest the number of applicants to NHS courses would be more adversely affected.

Last year at York, she adds, “we received around 3,000 applicants for around 225 HEE-funded places, so we would anticipate still being able to recruit sufficient numbers across nursing and midwifery for the time being”.



Dr Hall says that while a clear link cannot be drawn between the new measures and an applicant’s chances of attaining a place on a course, “an opening up of the cap on the number of places may improve opportunities”.

However, some fields of nursing may be affected more than others, adds Simpson. “Adult and children’s nursing and midwifery are much easier to recruit to than others, such as mental health and learning disability nursing. This is reflected in the numbers of applications received, and it may be more difficult to recruit into these two fields.”

Some aspiring nurses have already been put off by the scrapping of the bursary. Kate Smith, 20, a student studying health and social care at a further education college in Surrey, was hoping to study mental health nursing at university in September and was extremely disappointed to hear about the government’s plan.

“I wouldn’t say it has made me less likely to want to become a nurse as it has always been a passion of mine, but I’m worried about how I’ll be able to pay for expenses,” says Smith. “I wasn’t planning on having a student loan, as that would put a lot of stress on me personally.”

Others have already re-thought their plans. Sarah Vaughan, 20, an aspiring adult nurse and student doing an access to HE course in health at Northumberland College, will now have to take a year out to work and save money before starting university.

“I plan to get a job as a healthcare assistant, but these jobs aren’t easy to get without experience,” she says, adding that she’ll have to continue doing part-time bar work and find a full-time admin job when she finishes college.

If support for Saturday’s protest and the attitudes of current students are anything to go by, the government will face many more challenges to its plans. “Nursing isn’t a job that needs people who can pay for their degrees,” says Down. “It needs people who can care, and listen and hold your hand when your loved one is ill. You cannot put a monetary value on that.”
