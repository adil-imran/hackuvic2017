GETTY Furious ex-BHS employees yesterday demanded Sir Philip Green stopped 'swanning about' on holiday

They lashed out after the billionaire tycoon was involved in a heated clash with a television news team. Sky News broadcast an angry confrontation where Sir Philip lunged at the camera before being heard to say: “That’s going to go in the ******* sea.”

Sir Philip had been trying to evade reporter David Bowden on the Greek island of Ithaca, where his £100million superyacht Lionheart is anchored. As the Sky News crew approached him, the 64-year-old said: “I’m going to call the police if you don’t go away.”

Shamed Sir Philip has been at the centre of a public storm over the demise of high street favourite BHS and was quizzed by furious MPs during a heated select committee hearing two months ago. There have been growing calls for the retail tycoon to be stripped of his knighthood, which was awarded in 2006, with the Cabinet Office confirming that the honour is "under review". Iconic British chain BHS collapsed earlier this year after going bankrupt, putting thousands of loyal employees out of work. And Ex-BHS store boss Lin Macmillan said Sir Philip should be sorting out the failed firm’s pension black hole rather than “swanning around” on holiday. She said: “We would hope that the man has a conscience and would dig deep into his pockets, if necessary sell one of his yachts, and bail out the pension fund.”

One ex-BHS worker tweeted: “Sir Philip feeling unfairly treated? Same as the #BHS pensioners.” Sir Philip was also criticised by a senior Labour MP this week, who insisted that the billionaire should not be holidaying on his yacht at the very moment that BHS workers are losing their jobs. Green, whose Arcadia empire includes Topshop, owned BHS for 15 years before selling it to bankrupt former racing car driver Dominic Chappell for £1 in 2015. During that time billionaire tycoon took more than £400m in dividends from the department store chain, and left it with a £571m pension deficit.
