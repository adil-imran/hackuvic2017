HEALTH CARE: The Ontario Council of Hospital Unions says hospitals in our province are overcrowded and understaffed.

The industrial site is several acres in size and runs along the Montreal River.

SCIENCE: Researchers studying rocks underground in Timmins say they've found some clues to what may lie beneath the surface of Mars.
