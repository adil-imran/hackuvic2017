Syrian Politician: US Rejection of Russia's Plan Meant to Strengthen Terrorists in Aleppo

TEHRAN (FNA)- A prominent Syrian politician underlined that by vetoing Russia's plan, the US and its allies sought to help the terrorists in Aleppo to recruit and rebuild themselves.

"The US had two reasons to gather the UN Security Council members to reject the Russian plan which could end the clashes in Aleppo. Firstly, the Russian plan foiled many plots hatched by the US in Aleppo, including giving the terrorists an opportunity to take control of the entire city; secondly, the US took revenge from Russia for its earlier veto against the French plan," Fajr Zeidan, the secretary-general of the Syrian Forces Union, said on Tuesday.

He said after the UNSC's failure in approving the two proposed plans on the crisis in Syria the situation will naturally remain similar to the past. "This will more benefit the Russians who are defending their and their allies' achievements in Syria."

"After Russia used its veto right on the French plan which proposed creation of a no-fly zone in Aleppo, the US decided to mobilize 9 countries to reject the Russian plan and take revenge, as Washington is seeking to prevent the Russian fighter jets' flights over Aleppo airspace while the terrorists are regrouping," Zeidan said.

The UNSC vetoed two rival resolutions proposed by Russia and France on the escalating situation in Syria and the war-torn city of Aleppo in particular.

In his statement, the Russian envoy to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, said on Sunday that all of the members of the UNSC understood from the beginning that both draft resolutions would not go through.

"Today we are participating in one of the most bizarre scenes in the history of the UN Security Council. We will vote on the two draft Council resolutions, and we are all well aware that neither of them will be accepted," Churkin said.

The official urged all sides to restart the Syria peace process, which he said had been “jeopardized” by the radical groups.

The French proposal implied “upgraded” coordination of monitoring of the situation in Syria and reactivating the cessation of hostilities in Aleppo. One of the key points of the proposal was a halt to Syrian and Russian bombardment of East Aleppo.

However, Moscow and Damascus repeatedly stressed they are targeting terrorist hideouts there, which have been jeopardizing the cessation of hostilities.

The French proposal also included a call for all sides to prevent any material and financial resources reaching individuals or groups “associated with al-Qaeda and ISIL.” In addition, the French urged greater access for humanitarian aid deliveries across Syria.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said that the French-sponsored resolution “distorted” the real situation in Syria after the US refused to stick to the agreement on settling the crisis. The prohibition of flights over Aleppo “provides cover to terrorists from Jabhat al-Nusra” (also known as Fatah al-Sham Front) and those militants who allied with them, the Russian Foreign Ministry stated.

Moscow is nevertheless ready to work together on fulfilling the agreements reached earlier on resolving the deadlock in Syria, the Foreign Ministry added.

Russia for its part submitted to the UNSC a counter-resolution on Syria. According to the document, Moscow called for an immediate halt to the violence in war-ravaged Aleppo, but not for a halt to anti-terrorist strikes in the city. Monitoring should be then evaluated by the International Syrian Support Group (ISSG), the document said.

One of the key elements of the proposal was an urgent need for a separation of militants from terrorist groups like Fatah al-Sham in Aleppo, as agreed between Moscow and Washington in Geneva on September 9.

Commenting on the Russian resolution at the UNSC, the US representative stated that Moscow can’t justify its strikes in Aleppo with “a few hundred” Fatah al-Sham terrorists there.

However, according to the latest estimations by the UN between six and eight thousand militants are currently holding the Eastern part of Aleppo, with nearly a half estimated to belong or act together with the Fatah al-Sham terrorists.

Russian draft also strongly backed calls by the UN envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura to allow safe exit for Fatah al-Sham Front terrorists in order to bring relief to Aleppo.
