LAHORE - A writ petition was filed in the Lahore High Court yesterday challenging return of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to the country through a special aircraft of Pakistan International Airline (PIA).



Barrister Javed Iqbal Jafree filed an application in the LHC and submitted that a hefty amount from public exchequer was spent for sending special plane to London to bring Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif back to the homeland.

He submitted that the PM should bear all expenses for his medical treatment and travelling from his personal pocket instead of using public money.



The lawyer prayed to the court to order the federal government to pay all money spent for the treatment and travelling of the PM back to the public exchequer.



ORANGE LINE CASE: The Lahore High Court sought more arguments from the Punjab government regarding protection of historical monuments falling on the route of Orange line project and deferred proceedings until today (Tuesday).



During the proceedings, the petitioners’ counsel objected to the measures taken for protection of the historical monuments.

They informed the court about reservations of international organizations regarding the preservation of historical buildings on the route of Orange line project.



The law officers, however, opposed their arguments saying that international standard was maintained at sites near to historical monuments.

They assured the court that the buildings would be protected at every cost because they were the beauty of the city.

A division bench headed by Justice Abid Aziz Sheikh of the LHC sought more arguments from the government’s lawyers and adjourned the hearing for today.

The petitioners had challenged construction of the project saying that it would devastate the beauty and cultural landscape of the provincial metropolis.

They said it would also destroy environment and cause pollution.

They had also challenged the budget of the project and requested the court to set aside it.
