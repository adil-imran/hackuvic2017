Mumbai: Kishore Biyani-led Future Group's food arm Future Consumer Enterprise today launched its oats brand 'Kosh' and eyeing a revenue of Rs 200-300 crore in the next 2-3 years.

"Oats is an area where we have been working for the last one-and-a-half years. We have set up a Rs 85 crore joint venture manufacturing facility in Sri Lanka. This is one of our bigger brand launches. We are expecting a huge business coming out of it in the next 2-3 years," Future Group Chief Executive Officer Kishore Biyani told reporters here.

"In the next 2-3 years, we should be looking at Rs 200- 300 crore (from Kosh). By 2021, we are expecting close to Rs 1,000 crore," he added.

The Group currently has 27 brands under 65 categories, including food brands like Sunkist, Karmiq, Golden Harvest, Desi Atta, Fresh & Pure, Premium Harvest, Ektaa and Tasty Treat, among others.

"It (Kosh) will be widely distributed. It is one of the largest advertising spends, we are doing for any brand from our stable at the moment. For the next three years, we have an (advertising) outlay of Rs 65-70 crore," Biyani said.

Kosh will be available in four variants -- Instant Oats, Broken Oats, Oats Atta and Kosh Wheat+Oats Atta. The instant oats, broken oats and oats atta are priced at Rs 89 for 500 gm and Rs 170 for 1 kg. The wheat and oats atta are priced at Rs 62 for 1 kg and Rs 270 for 5 kg.
