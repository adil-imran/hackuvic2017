Kolkata, Sep 28: Gorkha Janmukti Morcha on Wednesday observed 12 hours shutdown in Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) area in West Bengal protesting against state chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Police arrested 12 supporters in various places of GTA area.

On Tuesday, Mamata Banerjee said that there will be no shutdown in the hills. She said that Bengal’s economy was affected by bandhs and therefore there should be no more bandhs and blockades. Last week also Mamata Banerjee had threatened that the government will not allow bandh in the Darjeeling Hills and will resist any such attempt. She also urged several development boards in the Hills to work for the economic growth of the Hills. However, the Gorkha Janamukti Morcha (GJM) chief Bimal Gurung said that they will go for a bandh in the Hills on September 28.

“Yesterday, she had announced that her government has given Rs 400 crore to the Gorkha Territorial Administration (GTA). We want a detail break up of this Rs 400 crore which, according to the chief minister, has been given to the GTA. If the chief minister fails to give any break-up by September 27, we will go for bandhs in Darjeeling from September 28,” Economic Times quoted Gurung as saying on Friday.

The chief minister said that that the the protestors threatened with bandhs and violences whenever there were talks about the election. She added saying that the behavior will not be tolerated. Banerjee said that instead of working for development, they were indulging in politics.

“We want peace in hills. We will not allow violence. Enough is enough. We must work for development. We have developed Lamahatta, Mirik, Tiger Hill, Lava Lolegaon. But they want to destroy it all by violence. We will not stop the process of development in the hills. We want people to get employment. We are here to address the issues of the hills. If the hills smile, we will smile,” Banerjee was quoted saying.
