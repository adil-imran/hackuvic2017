A top aide to Bill Clinton once said that Chelsea Clinton had a blabber mouth and accused her of 'running to daddy' to get her way.

Clinton Foundation executive Doug Band aggressively complained about Chelsea to other Clinton insiders in the weeks that followed her integration into her father's charity in November of 2011, a series of hacked emails reveal.

He told Hillary Clinton's Chief of Staff at the State Department Cheryl Mills, Democratic fundraiser Terry McAuliffe and former Bill Clinton chief of Staff John Podesta that Chelsea was the source of a leak about an 'internal investigation of money within the foundation.'

She told one of George W. Bush's daughters, who told someone else, who told a Republican Party operative, Band opined.

'I have heard more and more chatter of cvc and bari talking about lots of what is going on internally to people,' Band wrote. 'Not smart.'

The CVC in the email was Chelsea Victoria Clinton.

In another email he berated Chelsea for pressuring her father to heed another Clinton Foundation staffer's request that the charity work its annual conference around the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur.

'This is the 3rd time this week where she has gone to daddy to change a decision or interject herself in the process she says is so important to maintain,' the email said.

Band told the group, which included Justin Cooper, the aide who maintained Hillary's basement server, that Bill 'decided to keep cgi as it always was.'

The staffer who requested that the Clinton Global Initiative be moved 'is jewish/didnt like that decision and went to cvc and thus it will be changed,' Band opined.

'Wjc will say I never said it shouldn't be changed.. Sad because it will hurt cgi but the larger problem is that cvc has spent 7 days in her office to date and people will go to her with self interested choices to be made and she will side with them thus hurting the organization.

'Not my problemo any more...,' he added.

Band stepped down as Bill Clinton's chief adviser in 2012 as he shifted his focus to Teneo Holdings, a global consulting firm he helped found and the former president was an advisor to.

As Hillary Clinton geared up to run for president in 2015 Band ended his relationship with the foundation entirely.

Emails from 2011 to Podesta - now the chairman of Hillary's presidential campaign - and others that were published by Wikileaks show a distaste for the former first daughter and a rejection of her authority at the foundation.

'I just received a call from a close friend of wjcs who said that cvc told one of the bush 43 kids that she is conducting an internal investigation of money within the foundation from cgi to the foundation,' Band wrote in a Jan. 4, 2012, email.

He claimed, 'The bush kid then told someone else who then told an operative within the republican party.'

The email didn't say which of the Bush twins, Barbara or Jenna, she blabbed to.

Band unbraided Chelsea in another email, calling her a 'spoiled brat.' A December 2011 chain blamed her for the suicidal thoughts of the charity's chief operating officer.

'She is acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she's doing because she, as she has said, hasn't found her way and has a lack of focus in life,' Band wrote.

He says at another point, 'I realize it is difficult to confront and reason with her but this could go [too] far and then we all will have a real serious set of other problems.'

'I don't deserve this from her and deserve a tad more respect or at least a direct dialogue for me to explain these things.'

In an December 6 email Chelsea wrote to a number of people in her parents' inner circle including Podesta and McAuliffe, a long time Clinton friend who is now governor of Virginia, that 'two people separately' approached her in London and voiced their concerns about Band's firm, Teneo.

One Teneo employee 'called Members of the House and Members of Parliament', "on behalf of President Clinton," for Teneo clients ... without my father's knowledge and inelegantly and ineffectually at best and at worse has now precipitating people in London making comparisons between my father and Tony Blair's profit motivations,' Chelsea said.

'Which would horrify my father,' she said.

Blair has made an estimated personal fortune $74 million at October 2016 exchange rate since leaving office.

He has long been accused of using his office to enrich himself and his family - who now have a vast property portfolio in the UK - with lucrative contracts with JP Morgan, the World Bank and a series of governments, many in the Middle East or others which have faced questions over their human rights records.

The ex-British prime minister was the other member of the two-strong 'advisory board' at the time of Chlesea's email.

The Clinton's own fortune since leaving office has gone from $3 million of debt to an estimated $100 million in profit.

In the course of the bitter dispute about the foundation, Band hit back at Chelsea with the claim that she was a 'spoiled brat' who cared more about Teneo than the fact that she nearly drove a senior staff member to suicide.

'Late last night, laura graham called me as she couldn't reach my brother or her shrink,' Band wrote. 'She was on Staten Island in her car parked a few feet from the waters edge with her foot on the gas pedal and the car in park.'

Band said he had to convince the Clinton Foundation COO not to kill herself over office issues.

'She called me to tell me the stress of all of this office crap with wjc and cvc as well as that of her family had driven her to the edge and she couldnâ€™t take it anymore,' he said, making reference to both Chelsea, 'cvs,' and her father, 'wjc.'
