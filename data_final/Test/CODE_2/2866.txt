The Mail's campaign has gifted him a new legal team looking to overturn it

He has served three years of a life sentence for killing a Taliban insurgent

A sea of green berets filled Parliament Square yesterday as more than 2,000 ex-Royal Marines, ex-servicemen and supporters of jailed Marine Sergeant Alexander Blackman gathered in a mass show of support.

Sgt Blackman, who has spent three years behind bars, was jailed for life for killing a Taliban insurgent in Afghanistan in 2011.

His lawyers, paid for by generous Mail readers, argue he should have been convicted only of manslaughter.

The wheels of justice turn slowly. In some cases, very slowly indeed.

Alexander Blackman, former Acting Colour Sergeant of 42 Commando, Royal Marines, doesn’t need reminding of that.

He is sitting across a table in the cheerless visitor centre at Her Majesty’s Prison Erlestoke, in Wiltshire.

As always, he is obliged to wear the thin yellow sash of the convict rather than the proud green beret of his corps.

As we talk, the crump of gunfire comes drifting over Salisbury Plain from the Royal School of Artillery.

It is the sound of soldiers serving Queen and country rather than marking time in captivity at Her Majesty’s pleasure.

Almost 12 months have passed since Sgt Blackman applied to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) to have his highly controversial 2013 conviction and life sentence for the Afghan battlefield ‘murder’ of a dying Taliban fighter sent to the Court of Appeal.

In January, the CCRC decided his case was worthy of the highest level of priority for consideration.

But its review has since suffered what one MP has called ‘outrageous’ delays.Meanwhile, a steady toll is being taken on the man himself.

During our conversation, Sgt Blackman’s expression is often strained, while his skin — healthily tanned in the photos from his active service days — long ago assumed a prison yard grey pallor.

The 42-year-old is more muscular than when we last met in August 2015, thanks to his prison gym training for a sponsored power-lifting competition for charity.

Alas, that was cancelled by the authorities, who feared the contest would only encourage some inmates to get body-building steroid pills smuggled into the jail.

‘Just a bunch of middle-aged blokes trying to do some good,’ the Marine grumbles of his fellow prisoners’ thwarted efforts.

Since my last visit, there has been one significant development.

This summer, Erlestoke suffered the worst riot in its history.

Afterwards, 168 prisoners out of a total population of fewer than 500 were removed and dispersed elsewhere in the prison system.

They have not been replaced.

That is because the two wings ‘destroyed’ in the disturbances remain unrepaired and therefore are uninhabitable.

Soon after the riot, the prison governor ‘stepped down’ as was previously planned, and a new regime must pick up the pieces.

Such an explosion of communal violence isn’t supposed to happen at a low-risk Category C establishment like HMP Erlestoke.

But then, a man such as Blackman — a veteran of five tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, whose superiors thought him a ‘superb soldier’ — isn’t supposed to be here, behind bars.

One cannot help but feel that he has been pitched from one dysfunctional, ill-managed environment — 42 Commando’s ‘disastrous’ 2011 tour of Helmand province in Afghanistan, marred by undermanning, heavy casualties and failures in the chain of command — to another.

He is stuck in a jail system which, according to the Prison Governors Association recently, is in a ‘dark place’, with unprecedented levels of violence caused in part by chronic understaffing.

HMP Erlestoke was affected like many other penal institutions.

As a result, some inmates were being locked in their cells for 24 hours at a time, sometimes longer. Frustrations mounted.

There were also complaints by staff that B Category prisoners — those not requiring maximum security, but considered a danger to the public if they escaped — were being housed among what was supposed to be a low-risk, relatively placid population.

Tensions leapt in May with the introduction of a smoking ban throughout the jail — part of a phased prohibition across the entire UK prison system.

The new rule was unpopular to say the least; more than 80 per cent of inmates smoked.

One prisoner who recently left Erlestoke told me that overnight the ban had created a black market for contraband.

A smuggled bag of rolling tobacco, costing less than £20 outside, could fetch more than £100 behind Erlestoke’s razor wire-topped walls.

With cigarette papers also forbidden, some inmates identified the soft, thin pages of prison library Bibles as an ideal replacement. Others improvised by smoking teabags.

But for most inmates the ban was insurmountable and unbearable. Smoking was perhaps their only pleasure.

Within weeks, HMP Erlestoke exploded — though the Ministry of Justice has, of course, denied any link.

One summer Saturday evening, a small number of prisoners in two of the seven accommodation wings went on the rampage.

Specially trained staff had to be rushed in from other jails in the region to contain the disturbances, which finally ended in the early hours of that Sunday morning.

By then, most of the fixtures and fittings in the blocks affected had been destroyed.

Sgt Blackman’s cell window happened to overlook one of the rioting wings.

But he wanted no part in the anarchy.

‘Some guys on my wing came into my cell because of its grandstand view and began shouting encouragement to those in the other block,’ he says.

‘I asked them to stop, because if they were seen at my window I would get the blame, and (under the Public Order Act) you can get another ten years on top of your sentence for taking part in a riot.

‘There will always be some here who have an “us and them” approach to the prison authorities and life inside. But mine is a strictly “me and me” or a “me and Claire” [his wife].

‘I have no interest in getting into trouble. I am polite to everyone, and if anyone is rude to me I just don’t react. I don’t know how much longer I will be in here, a year or until 2020, but I don’t want to make it harder for me or for Claire.

‘Our future is the most important thing and I don’t want to jeopardise it any more than it has been already. Claire has suffered enough.’

He says the highlight of his week is ‘the two hours I get to hold Claire’s hand during visiting time’.

I had seen Claire Blackman shortly before I visited her husband.

She is a redoubtable woman, but the separation and delays are increasingly unbearable for her, too.

The couple have no children, so Claire endures their ordeal largely alone.

‘As the wife of a Royal Marine, I try to treat our time apart like just another tour,’ she says.

‘But this is now the longest tour ever, and I just want him home.

‘I know I only have to wait a week until I can visit him again, but at times it’s really hard.

'We both love walking and not being able to share an amazing view, I really miss that.

‘You can be surrounded by friends and family but still feel lonely.

‘Before Al was arrested, we had begun to talk about moving out of our terrace home in Taunton and buying a country cottage.

‘So while I have enjoyed helping a friend find a new house in the country, the house viewings have been tinged with sadness that our life is on hold.

‘Family celebrations are the times when I most expect to miss Al by my side, but it’s also those insignificant moments.

‘Even just ordering a takeaway and settling down for a night in with a film reminds you how lonely life can be without the man you love beside you.’

Sgt Blackman is in Erlestoke because of one moment’s loss of discipline on the battlefield. It took place on September 15, 2011, towards the end of six months’ service in the Nad-e-Ali district

Concerns had been expressed about 42 Commando’s leadership even before the tour began.

The British government had also already decided on withdrawing our troops from Afghanistan.

But small groups of Royal Marines soon found themselves isolated and fighting a ruthless enemy.

Casualties among Blackman’s close colleagues grew.

Body parts of dismembered Marines were hung in trees as trophies by the Taliban.

There was a discussion about the possibility of getting him airlifted to hospital.

Then Blackman drew his pistol and shot the Afghan.

This was captured on film by one of his men, and the film was then by chance obtained by the British police. Blackman was arrested and court-martialled for murder.

He pleaded not guilty.

At trial, he said he thought the Taliban fighter was already dead when shot.

He knew he shouldn’t have done it — the act was against the Geneva Convention — but it could not be murder.

He was not examined for possible post-traumatic stress syndrome.

Nor was the lesser charge of manslaughter offered by the Judge Advocate General or the prosecution, or even sought by his defence team.

Remember, this happened on a foreign battlefield, not a UK street.

Blackman was found guilty.

He received a mandatory life sentence with a minimum tariff before consideration of parole of ten years, reduced on appeal to eight.

Not surprisingly, many saw him as a political scapegoat for an unpopular war, and 100,000 people signed a petition for the conviction to be overturned.

In September last year, fortified with new and compelling evidence that had not been presented at the court-martial, the Mail began a campaign for Blackman to be freed.

Within a month our readers had raised £800,000 to pay for a new legal team to pursue his case.

Meanwhile, Blackman waits at Erlestoke.

One issue that angers him is the activities of the civilian-led Iraq Historic Allegations Team, based a few miles down the road at Upavon.

The Royal Military Police’s Operation Northmoor has been more recently established to investigate alleged wrongdoing in Afghanistan.

Both bodies have been fed thousands of claims of misconduct by UK forces against locals.

Many of these allegations are spurious but have been nurtured by compensation-hungry UK law firms.

The cost to the taxpayer is in the many tens of millions.

Another Mail campaign has secured a government promise of an exemption from prosecution for servicemen in future wars.

But the current legal frenzy carries on.

‘It sickens me,’ says Sgt Blackman.

‘[Marines] on visits here have told me how our boys are being harassed by investigators over ancient incidents for which they were cleared by senior officers on the ground, at the time they happened. Now they have been re-activated.

‘We seem to be the only Armed Forces in the world that pursue their soldiers in this way, yet our military is still magnificent.

‘[A very senior Royal Marines NCO] told me how he recently went to the States and met his opposite number in the U.S. Marine Corps.

'The American said he would swap ten of his guys for one of ours.

‘Over there they are focused on numbers and equipment, while we still turn out the best-trained elite soldiers.

'The defence cuts are going too far and the potential prosecutions are a disgrace.’

He is furious at the way soldiers are silenced.

‘Nobody in the military is allowed their own voice if it goes against the official line. Brexit was a good example.

'The Government wheeled out the former top brass who supported the Remain campaign.

'You were supposed to think no one in the military wanted Brexit, which was untrue.’

Today the former Marine is a library orderly and studying for an Open University degree in social sciences while also taking a course to be a personal trainer

Today, he concentrates on keeping his head down in prison.

‘Do I want to become a personal trainer when I’m released? Not really,’ he admits.

‘But I have to face the fact that unless my conviction is quashed, I will leave here with a criminal record.

'And when you are in that position you need to have as many strings to your bow as possible.

'That can only be done by maintaining discipline.’

Sgt Blackman is hugely encouraged by the support from Mail readers and others.

He still gets a large postbag to which he cannot afford to reply, given his £13-a-week maximum prison wage.

‘At the time of my conviction, it was suggested that I was the most evil man ever to wear uniform, so I want to thank all those people from the bottom of my heart,’ he says.

‘Not only for standing by me but paying for my new legal team. Without them, I wouldn’t have the hope I have today.’

There are tears in his eyes.

By the time you read this, a Criminal Cases Review Commission psychiatrist will finally have paid him a visit.

The appointment was promised in April (it’s amazing what a little encouragement from the Mail and supportive politicians can do to get things moving).

Yesterday’s show of support for his cause by ex-servicemen in Parliament Square was, like last year’s event, awe-inspiring.

‘I wish I could be there, too,’ Sgt Blackman says as we part.
