Whatever happened to the UPI and PPD polls? Where do they stand today?



To: Attention Surplus Disorder

I guess you’re making a point about people not be good at math.

two for $3 is a better deal than 3 for $5

Buying one is the best deal of all.

Whatever happened to the UPI and PPD polls? Where do they stand today? Wait until they take into account Trump's debate performance. That should be in the next few days.

10 years ago I stopped at Mc Donalds for an Ice cream, they were on sale, $1 each or 2 for $2. of course I asked the girl, does that mean I will save more if I bought more, and she said yes. If I wanted 5 would I get them for $5? She said yes. What a deal!

CNN has been running a banner all night claiming Hillary leads by 11 points. Why are they so panicked if this is true?

Wait until they take into account Trump's debate performance.



This, exactly. The media hype over the Access Hollywood tape skewed poll numbers, but the polls will return to the previous numbers once people realize how little the tape and the controversy amount to. And Trump's strong performance in the second debate will reinforce his numbers. The polling will likely get a lot closer as we close in on Election Day.

Fake picture of course but still kind of funny.

No! It’s a real picture (except for the “Hillary Leads” caption which I added) of a real price tag I encountered food shopping tonight!

To: Attention Surplus Disorder

The 3 for $5.00 is for mix and match, while the 2 for $3.00 is not. So, as stupid as it looks at first glance, there is a sort of logic going on, at least from the store’s perspective.



To: Attention Surplus Disorder

The Hillary was obvious but I thought the pricing was a joke.

Good grief!
