Russia must "step up to the plate" to help bring about a diplomatic solution to the Syrian civil war.

Defence minister Lord Howe said the only solution to the bloody conflict was through dialogue but with the Russian war planes carrying out "indiscriminate bombing" of the besieged city of Aleppo, the ball was now in Russia's court on the diplomatic front.

Last week a UN security council resolution drafted by France to ban all overflights of the northern Syrian city was vetoed by Russia.

On Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson raised diplomatic hackles in Moscow when he called for "demonstrations outside the Russian embassy" over its bombing campaign.

After visiting a mosque in Birmingham on Friday, the minister of state for the Ministry of Defence, Lord Howe, said: "The situation in Aleppo is desperate and I think we have to engage on every front to try to bring a halt to the fighting.

"Unfortunately we are in the situation where diplomatic efforts have faltered.

"It's only by a diplomatic solution that we can end the situation in Syria.

"But when you have a UN resolution promoted by France, that was vetoed by Russia, and when you have Russia engaging in indiscriminate bombing of Aleppo, it is actually incumbent on the Russians, I think, to step up to the plate and ensure that that diplomatic process can be re-started."

Lord Howe had earlier addressed community leaders at Birmingham Central Mosque shortly after Friday prayers had finished, where he made a case for greater engagement between different faiths and communities.

He told delegates it was important to build "mutual understanding" between Islam and other faiths, and the British armed forces, highlighting the shared history and heritage going back before the First World War.

Speaking after about 5,000 worshippers had finished prayers, Lord Howe said: "The armed forces are our armed forces, they're your armed forces and exist to protect the whole of UK society, not just a part of it."

He said British forces were fighting to make the world "a better and safer place", including in Iraq where they are tackling so-called Islamic State, and also on peace-keeping operations in South Sudan and Somalia.

Lord Howe, pointing out that 500,000 Muslim troops had volunteered to serve for British Imperial forces in the First World War, said there was a strong and historic bond between Islam and the UK armed services.

He highlighted the death of Pakistani-born Lance Corporal Jabron Hashmi, from Bordesley Green in Birmingham, who was killed in action in Sangin in Afghanistan in 2006.

Lord Howe said: "He (L/Cpl Hashmi) died to stop terrorists using Afghanistan as a safe haven - terrorists that want to obliterate our way of life."

Pointing out there were 550 Muslim soldiers currently serving, he added: "Our nation is made stronger by the service of all faiths and, indeed, of no faiths."

He said: "We live in a volatile world.

"We're united in shared values. Only by standing together and being firm about what we believe in can we secure a safe and prosperous future for our children."

Lord Howe had earlier visited Durga Bhawan Hindu temple, the Guru Nanak Nishkam Sewak Jatha Sikh gurdwara and spoken to pupils at Birmingham's South and City College.

He was also due to address a multi-faith audience at the city's St Chad's Cathedral.
