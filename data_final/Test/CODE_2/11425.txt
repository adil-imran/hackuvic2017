A GROUP of Grade 12 students went on a rampage in their school after realising that the answer sheets they had bought from a man before the national examinations started last week were fake.

Eastern Highlands provincial police commander Superintendent Alex N’Drasal said police were investigating the incident involving the students from Asaroka Secondary School outside Goroka.

He said the students had collected K1000 to buy the answers sheets from the man.

They realised after the completion of the national examinations last Friday that the answers sheets were fake.

“They had memorised all the answers and (used them) in their examination papers,” he said.

“So after the examination, they destroyed school properties. The principal called the police. But the students had escaped (when police arrived). We are now investigating the damage and will soon round them up.”

A spokesperson for the Education department in Port Moresby told The National yesterday that they were yet to receive a report on the matter from officials in the province.

It could not also be confirmed the extent of damage to the school.

N’Drasal said it should teach students not to cheat.

“You study hard and must not cheat. Because if you cheat, you will end up being cheated,” he said.

“The students wanted to take a short cut by not studying hard for their examinations and decided to cheat.

“They got cheated. So they became frustrated and damaged school properties.

“They have to blame themselves for their (cheating) decisions. Not the school.”

He said reports reaching his office indicated that many Grade 10 and 12 students in the province had been buying fake answer sheets which they thought were genuine.

Meanwhile, N’Drasal said a man arrested earlier for attempting to sell Grade 10 and 12 students at the Lufa Secondary School “answer sheets” had been released from police custody.

“The school principal advised us that they were fake answers sheets. The principal also did not bring in the teacher who was with the suspect when they were caught,” he said.

“So we cannot do any thing. We cannot investigate the selling and buying of the fake answers sheets.

“After all, no one is complaining and reporting to us.

“Not even the teachers, parents and the students.”
