More than 100 lighthouses that no longer are critical to the U.S. Coast Guard have been transferred to nonprofit groups and government entities at no cost or sold through public auction under the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000.

The General Services Administration first offers the lighthouse to the entities and nonprofits. If no qualified applications are received, the properties are sold.

As of February, 41 lighthouses have gone to nonprofits, 22 to local governments, three to state governments, eight to federal agencies and 45 were sold.

Here are the lighthouses in 22 states and Puerto Rico, and the type of transfer, with the gross proceeds for those sold, according to the General Services Administration. The list does not include two lighthouses far offshore in Lake Michigan that recently sold at auction but need to complete closing. The North Manitou Shoal Lighthouse went for $73,000 and White Shoal Lighthouse for $110,000.
