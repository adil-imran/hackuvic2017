NEW DELHI: Two of the five major Swachh Bharat awards to be presented by the Centre are likely to go to Gujarat. UNESCO-approved Rani Ki Vav at Patan in Gujarat is all set to get the "cleanest monument award" while textile city Surat is likely to get the tag of the city with cleanest railway station, officials said.These awards will be presented to the winners by PM Narendra Modi himself at the first IndoSan (India sanitation) conference on September 30. Nearly 1,200 stakeholders of Swachh Bharat , mostly district collectors, villages heads, sanitation specialists, NGO workers, mayors and municipal commissioners, are expected to take part in the event that is modelled on conferences held in foreign countries.Officials said all ministries at the Centre were asked to draw up their nominations under Swachh Bharat a few months ago. "The major categories were the cleanest monument, cleanest tourist spot, cleanest school, hospital, railways station, city and village. The ministries were asked to follow rigorous evaluation process before deciding the winners," a top official said.Tourism officials said Rani Ki Vav is an intricately constructed stepwell on the banks of Saraswati river.Built as a memorial to an 11th century AD king, it was added to the list of UNESCO's World Heritage Sites in June 2014. Last year, the PM himself had tweeted asking tourists to visit the spot. Officials in the government said Taj Mahal lost out due to the "approach area." There were eleven monuments and six tourist places that were evaluated for the process, an official added.In the school and hospital category, Kendriya Vidyalaya in Dehradun and PGI in Chandigarh are likely to be among the top contenders but some nominations in Hyderabad, Bihar and Arunachal Pradesh are still being looked at, an official said. The cleanest tourist place is likely to go to Gangtok but Mandya, Halihasar, Trivandrum are among the contenders.Officials said a series of events has been lined up from September 25 ro October 2. Two years after unveiling the Swachh Bharat Mission on October 2, 2014 with a target of 2019 for the country to go ODF (Open Defecation Free), the PM will take stock of efforts and the way ahead."This will be an occasion for everyone to rededicate themselves to the cause of Swachh Bharat. 15-20 more districts in Karnataka, Himachal, Haryana and Gujarat will be added to ODF on October 2. Kerala is set to be the first big state, after Sikkim, to go ODF on November 1. Himachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Punjab and Haryana are also close. Around 100 districts could be ODF by end of 2016-17. But we don't want to be carried away. We have to look at the challenges, it is a long road ahead. There is a recognition that it will not be easy but top-to-bottom commitment is there. Wherever ODF has been done, it has to be sustained," Parameswaran Iyer, Secretary, Drinking Water and Sanitation told ET.Taking stock, "re-dedicating" oneself to the cause of Swachh Bharat and ensuring the ODF status achieved is sustained will be the likely messages of PM Modi to the gathering, officials said. The PM will also release the Amar Chitra Katha series on Swachh bharat at the event.This is for the first time ministry of drinking water and sanitation and ministry of urban development are coming together to host an event of this scale. On September 14, Urban developmet secretary Rajiv Gauba had asked for all media units of the I &B ministry to take adequate steps to publicise the event.At the IndoSan, besides a plenary session focusing on behavioural change, the government will have cross-sectoral sessions on sanitation in railways, schools and the 10 iconic places.
