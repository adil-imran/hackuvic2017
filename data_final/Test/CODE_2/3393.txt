CETA opponents overruled

The nation’s highest court has rejected calls from opponents of a EU-Canada trade deal for an injunction that had the potential to spell an end to the pact. The Federal Constitutional Court yesterday ruled against the complaints against the trade deal with Canada, known as CETA. Tens of thousands of citizens joined in two of those complaints. Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, who is also minister of the economy, had warned putting off CETA’s signing could effectively torpedo the accord.

London home building slows

Sales of London homes under construction dropped 14 percent in the third quarter as uncertainty surrounding the terms of Britain’s exit from the EU hurt demand already dented by higher taxes. The number of residences sold before completion in the period fell to 4,830 units from 5,636 a year earlier, according to a report by researcher Molior London seen by Bloomberg News. A spokesman for Molior declined to comment.

Uniqlo recovery predicted

Fast Retailing Co yesterday forecast full-year operating profit will improve 37 percent as the owner of the Uniqlo casual-wear chain recovers from a slump in the last fiscal year by committing to lower prices to win back customers.

Cathay shares dive

Shares in Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (國泰航空) yesterday plunged more than 5 percent after it scrapped its profit outlook for the second half of the year, citing competition and overcapacity.
