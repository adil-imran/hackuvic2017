Palmer is said to have murdered his girlfriend Shauna Haynes

A man arranged an orgy with his girlfriend and two others then strangled her in a jealous rage before stuffing her body in a suitcase, a court heard.

Joshua Matthew Palmer could face the death penalty if convicted of murder, murder during a rape, murder during sodomy and murder during a rape by an instrument.

After killing his girlfriend, the 32-year-old dumped the suitcase containing her body out with the rubbish, prosecutors say.

Palmer denies all charges.

Chelsea Shea, a witness, testified she had drinks with Palmer at a bar in San Diego on April 4, then agreed to go back to the Chadwick Hotel, in San Diago, California with him.

The pair were having sex when Palmer's girlfriend, 21-year-old Shauna Haynes, and a man named Anthony Kern turned up, Shea said.

Shea, Kern and Haynes then had sex together, it is said, but Palmer just “stood there,” then “told us to leave.”

But Haynes said she wanted to stay with Palmer, reports the Times of San Diego .

A few hours later Palmer called the police and told them his girlfriend was missing.

Detectives found him with red knuckles on both his hands.

They seized video files from Palmer’s mobile phone, one of which shows the victim unconscious.

In another clip, Palmer can be heard saying: “I’m sorry I love you, but I can’t watch you having sex with somebody else.

"God I’m sorry.”

Deputy District Attorney Martin Doyle claims Palmer then stuffed her corpse into a suitcase and threw it out with the rubbish.

On April 6 a guest found the suitcase with the victim’s body in near a row of rubbish bins at the back of the hotel.

Palmer was arrested two days later.

No trial has been set, but a status conference is scheduled for November 9.
