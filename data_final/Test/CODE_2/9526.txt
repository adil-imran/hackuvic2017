1 Teachers protest: Teachers in Poland held protests Monday over a government plan to overhaul the public school system, putting added pressure on the conservative ruling party that already has been facing growing criticism both domestically and internationally. The union says a government plan to eliminate middle schools would introduce chaos into the Polish educational system and cause class sizes to grow. Teachers also fear it will lead many of them to lose their jobs, though the Education Ministry says it won’t. In Warsaw, teachers gathered in the rain and accused the government of refusing to take their concerns into account. “Even the communists didn’t close schools,” one banner read.

2 Buildings collapse: At least 22 people were killed Monday in the collapse of a group of decrepit homes in eastern China, state media reported. The cause of the collapses in the city of Wenzhou is under investigation, although reports said the four buildings were constructed in the 1970s by their farmer owners and were in a highly degraded state. Poor construction quality has long been a problem in China, particularly in the countryside and smaller cities.

3 Pipeline project: The leaders of Russia and Turkey on Monday reached a deal for the construction of a gas pipeline, a plan that was suspended amid tensions between the two countries. In separate addresses to the World Energy Congress in Istanbul, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan said their countries wanted to press ahead with the Turkish Stream project. The pipeline will carry Russian natural gas to Turkey and on to European Union countries. Turkey and Russia are working to normalize ties that were strained last year by Turkey’s downing of a Russian warplane near the border with Syria.

4 Iraq ruling: Iraq’s federal court ruled on Monday that Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi’s move to abolish the largely ceremonial posts of the country’s vice president and deputy prime minister is unconstitutional. Under Iraq’s Constitution, abolishing the posts would require the approval of a majority in parliament followed by a national referendum, the court said. The decision was a slap for al-Abadi, who canceled the posts last year as part of a reform plan. The changes were also an apparent attempt to consolidate power under al-Abadi’s government in order to combat corruption and tackle the country’s ballooning budget crisis.

5 Nigeria unrest: A newly outlawed Shiite Muslim group in northern Nigeria on Monday accused officials of using tear gas, clubs and sticks to round up members including women and children, as pressure grew on a minority group that the military has accused of trying to assassinate its army chief. Africa’s most populous nation is almost equally divided between Christians and Muslims, most of them Sunni. A Kaduna state commission recently said the Iranian-inspired Islamic Movement in Nigeria was responsible for provoking an attack in December during which the army gunned down more than 300 Shiites. The report said the violence began with a blockade that halted the convoy of Nigeria’s army chief, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai. Human Rights Watch has quoted witness accounts that soldiers started shooting at schoolchildren leaving a mosque an hour before Buratai’s convoy approached the roadblock, indicating the raid had been planned. Nigeria’s military is often accused of human rights violations.
