NABLUS: Nablus, the second largest city in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, was gripped by violent protests on Tuesday after the death of a Palestinian detainee shortly after he was seized by Palestinian security forces.

Hundreds of protesters, some throwing stones, marched through the city to denounce the death of Ahmed Halawa, who was seized during a police raid on suspects linked to the death of two police officers last week.

"Security forces detained Ahmed Izz Halawa during a complicated and delicate security operation in Nablus," Adnan Al Dmairi, the spokesman for the Palestinian Authority's security services, said in a statement.

Halawa was killed after he was taken to Juneid prison in Nablus, he said, although the exact circumstances of his death were not clear. Kamal Al-Rjoub, the governor of Nablus, said Halawa was beaten to death by members of the security forces.

Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Al-Hamdallah promised a full investigation, describing the incident as "rare". Halawa was a senior member of the Al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade, a militant group linked to the Fatah party.

In some cases militants have become involved in criminal activity, which the Palestinian security forces have been cracking down on, the Palestinian government said. Last week, security forces carried out a raid in Nablus targeting a criminal group suspected of harbouring weapons. Two suspects were killed, one of them a relative of Halawa's, and two officers were shot dead.

Rjoub, the governor, said Ahmed Halawa was "the mastermind" behind the shooting of the officers. The Palestinian Authority is responsible for security and policing inside Palestinian cities and municipal areas, while Israeli security forces retain full control over around 60 percent of the West Bank, all of which the Palestinians seek for an independent state, alongside East Jerusalem and Gaza.

Meanwhile, Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah said Tuesday that a probe will be opened into the circumstances of the killing of a suspect by Palestinian National Authority (PNA) security forces in the West Bank.

Hamdallah said during the weekly cabinet meeting that the investigation will be led by the justice minister and its outcome will be published immediately after it is concluded, the Palestinian official news agency reported.

Earlier on Tuesday, PNA police spokesman Adnan Damiri said that the deceased man was the main instigator behind the killing of two security men in Nablus on Thursday.

Two Palestinian security members were killed on Thursday in a crossfire in the West Bank city of Nablus, after they killed two armed wanted men in the old city. After the suspect was arrested, security men beat him severely, and he died, the spokesman said. Meanwhile, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) called on Israel to open a comprehensive investigation into the killing of a young Palestinian in the southern West Bank city of Hebron last week. UNRWA voiced concern over the killing of Mohammad Abu Hashhash, 19, in Al-Fawwar refugee camp in an Israeli military operation last Tuesday. "Israeli authorities, as occupying power, is obliged to protect civilians, including refugees," it said.
