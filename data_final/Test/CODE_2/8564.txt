Hillary In Leaked Email: Saudi Arabia And Qatar Are Funding ISIS !!!

The Dailey Caller ^ | 10/11/2016 | ALEX PFEIFFER Reporter

Posted on by WENDLE

Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton sent an email to her campaign chairman John Podesta in 2014, who was then-counselor to President Barack Obama, that said Saudi Arabia and Qatar are both giving financial and logistical support to the Islamic State and other extremist Sunni groups, according to a recent Wikileaks release.

In a rare exception to the serial lies she tells, hillary at least provides us with her private truth about Saudi Arabia and if you will permits a focus here for just a minute we can then return to the germane. Saudi Arabia is by far the greatest exporter of direct religious attacks on the United State of America, well beyond any other country. The "28" pages from the 911 commission revealed shocking truth that that the 911 hijacking attack was supported right out of the Saudi Embassy with direct knowing support of hijackers including money run through personal accounts of the Saudi Ambassador And his wife paid to the handlers of the hijackers or in some cases directly to them on such things as flight training. But here we have the Secretary of State admitting our governments knowledge that the Saudis give "financial and logistical support" to ISIS !! We have had 1200 known Isis incidences in the US according to the FBI director? San Bernadino!! The Mateen gay bar massacre,Nidal Hassan at ft Hood!! All ISIS under the direct support and logistical assistance by the Saudi GOVERNMENT!! Off our shores, we have mass beheading of Christians-- people in cages drowned in hydrochloric acid - Christians set on fire. 200 Chistians slaughter on mount Sinjar-- All financed and logistically supported by Saudi Arabia!! And we just avert our gaze? Back to the election issue. This email of CONFIDENTIAL information to Podesta, a civilian, was a blatant unpunished criminal act by hillary --- again.

Well it’s time to nuke Riyadh.



To: WENDLE

Don’t forget that McCain, Graham and Rubio helped to arm the jihadists that became ISIS.

We should have gone to war with Saudi Arabia after September 11th, 2001. 15 of the 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, the 28 pages and now they are funding ISIS. Saudi Arabia has declared war on us without any announcement.



To: Lurkinanloomin

Dont forget that McCain, Graham and Rubio helped to arm the jihadists that became ISIS. And Bush.



To: Enlightened1

Saudi Arabia leaders don’t want to go to war with us. We make them trillions of dollars. What they want is for us to be The Great Evil their people can hate so that the Saudi Arabian people don’t turn their anger on the leaders.

I’ve been sitting for two days now since this got released and waiting for some dramatic German “what-the-heck” announcement, but state-run news in Germany has basically skipped this ISIS-Saudi Arabia funding story. All of this immigration garbage and spiral in Germany politics....all due to Saudi Arabia....and no one says a word.



To: WENDLE

Was Hillary SOS at the time? Or was she also a private citizen?



To: WENDLE

3000 people, many jumping from 100 stories. 2 firemen friends dead. Had to drive past the wreckage on detour for 2 years. Remember giving blood. So many people there that anyone who knew how to draw blood at all was doing it. She massacred me :) I know this sounds crazy but I saved the blood soaked gauze. I dont know why. I want the Sauds to PAY. I dont want to hear “the alternative is worse” Kill THEM TOO!!!

Trump said Killary created ISIS.



To: Ethan Clive Osgoode

“Well its time to nuke Riyadh.” Well it will certainly be time for President Trump to have a “come to Jesus conversation” with the Gulf States. When the Raghead “royal family” understands that Mecca and Medina (and Ryadi) are all targeted with ICBMs maybe they will rethink their strategy. If not, we should cut off all support for the American A/C they have and reduce their military capability to zero. Then let them have a battle to the death with Iran. Why waste our own arsenal, when Iran is “so handy.”



To: Ethan Clive Osgoode

Thanks. We do make for a convenient pipe for them to blow off steam, don’t we?

2 interesting things from her 8-point plan: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3774 * #4 - she names the ISIL financial support from SA, but fails to mention ensuring it cuts off, other than by diplomatic pressure * #7 - talks about the success of air power used when the Tripoli embassy was evacuated, as if this was a surprise; too bad she didnt grasp this on 9/11/2012



To: Ethan Clive Osgoode

“Well its time to nuke Riyadh.” Yeah, well, first we will have to nuke their well-purchased and well-owned allies that make up almost all of Washington D.C.



To: WENDLE

Wow, now isn’t she stating what most of us already figured out by this point!



To: Personal Responsibility

We do make for a convenient pipe for them to blow off steam, dont we? Yes. We serve many roles for them. Mercinaries, money-making, weapons suppliers, technology providers, oil extractors, and devil incarnate. Every so often Americans need to die at the hands of Saudi-funded terrorists so that Saudis can continue to feel superior.



To: WENDLE

I agree we should be angry, for the way our Representatives and Senators and other government official have helped do everything they can to take down America...but we have to win this election FIRST before WE can do anything... Put the wiki leaks on facebook, twitter, instagram, snap chat, any social media you can find, keep posting them over and over again... Send to Drudge, Rush, Sean, Consecutive Tribune; Gateway Pundit and other places... Send to Trump's face book page, let people that follow him know what is going on... We have to keep high pressure on from today until Nov 9th...we CANNOT at any cost let Hillary steal this election or the RINOs; GOPe; Wall Street; Super Pacs; and government officials put her in the White House... WIN!!! WIN!!! WIN!!! GO.TRUMP/PENCE.GO!!! ALL THE WAY TO THE OVAL OFFICE!!!

What exactly is different now than two and half decades ago when we started a never ending war to protect the Kingdom of Saud with U.S. tax dollars and U.S. citizens’ blood?

I mean aside from TRILLIONS wasted, thousands of American lives lost, 10s of thousands of Americans wounded, and the creation of a vast surveillance state to monitor Americans? Most of the people alive in the Middle East have known a LIFETIME of being bombed by Americans. What have we gained?



To: WENDLE

Add one more dot to your chain, that under Clinton the US exported record amounts of arms to the Saudis.



To: Enlightened1

Michael Moore said the Bushes were owned by the Saudis and thus partly responsible for 911. When you’re right, you’re right

To: pepsionice

There is control asserted both now and in the past over telling the American people the truth the reality of Saudi sunni support of Bin Laden through today’s Isis. The reason is campaign contributions and Donor control over the establishment and the complicit press with the truth about the Saudi dogs!!

I saw Jon Bolton this morning. He is a classic NEO Con Globalist trying to pass as “ Best interest of America” establishment hack. Trump would be well advised in his administration to let this guy even close to the Sate Department. I knew he was going to talk about the Saudi financial and logistical of ISIS knowing he has known this for YEARS!!

I will summarize his “Neo Con” take . He said Hillary was speaking conclusions and he would have to see the “evidence” about Saudi involvement. — really? The SECRETARY OF STATE states unequivocally, on one rare occasion, confirming the 911 commission 28 pages and Bolton goes into denial and wants more evidence? Bolton went was in damage control. The American people have been LIED to about Saudi Arabian sunni attacks on our people to cover for business deals and campaign contributions . The Saudis owe us a lot of money and a lot of BLOOD!!

Saudis are also responsible for the majority of, overwhelmingly Wahhabist-radical, mosques built in the US in the last couple of decades.



To: WENDLE

The Saudis fund ISIS... ...and HILLARY CLINTON’s CAMPAIGN.



To: Personal Responsibility

Saudi Arabia is a welfare state that needs high oil prices” Our fracking etc. has brought prices down prompting SA to want to sell its natural gas to Europe. Russia, the current provider, is in the way. SA has purchased Clinton and the rest of the traitors in our government.

To: WENDLE

Saudi Arabia most likely, given the size of the House of Saud. It’s likely ISIS is getting funding from certain members of the House of Saud, funneled through Islamic banks in Qatar, Bahrain and possibly the UAE.

To: Morpheus2009

Wow, now isnt she stating what most of us already figured out by this point! Partially Ever wonder why Obama’s favorite place to send released Gitmo prisoners was Qatar? Qatar is the home base and safe haven for much of the al-Qaeda/ ISIS leadership and it's center of operations and it is also a base and safe haven for HAMAS upper level leaders doing the same thing against Israel. The five high level Taliban Generals that Obama released, literally on the eve of the first big ISIS invasion of Iraq and Syria, were sent to Qatar. One of the big mysteries of the rise of ISIS was how they were able to pull together a cohesive, Jihadi army of tens of thousands of well trained fighters in the space of a few short months. Consider this - the Five Taliban Generals that Obama released to Qatar , ISIS’s operational headquarters, were the guys who were responsible tor training and indoctrination of the Jihadi fighters who traveled to Afghanistan from all over the world for terrorist training and they were also the ones who taught the Jihadii how organize and train their own networks of al -Qaeda sleeper cells in their home countries upon their return. These Five Taliban Generals were also the handlers of world wide network of al-Qaeda sleeper cell network. It is very likely that these five Taliban Generals worked with the ISIS leaders headquartered in Qatar to bring in al-Qaeda sleeper cell members from all over the world to help staff the rapidly expanding ISIS Jihadi Army

saudi Arabia should have been our first target after 9/11, and when Trump gets in, we should still take them down.

Nuke’m without using nukes. Immediately halt all imports of Saudi oil. Watch the Saudi Royals put their palaces up for sale and move into 1200 sq. ft. apartments. Goodness sakes alive, how much longer are we going to prop up the Saudi royals?

DRILL HERE DRILL NOW

Goodness sakes alive, how much longer are we going to prop up the Saudi royals? We, the most powerful people in history, have been doing the bidding of sand monkeys.



To: Ethan Clive Osgoode

The whole damn gubbamint is complicit. The founding fathers would have been mustering the militia.



To: servantboy777

The whole damn gubbamint is complicit. Yes. The Saudis have (or used to have) more than enough money to buy every politician in America. Perhaps they are running out, so this is why we are seeing things like this 28 page report and approval for court cases against them.



To: thoughtomator

Yes . Arms exports kick backs to these politicians on sales to Saudi Arabia is big reason for averting their gaze.

Let me point this out. I have been carefully watching a Rep Congressman from Texas who was a no name but ended up as chairman of the armed forces budget and oversight committee— Thornberry. 75% of his contributions are defense contractors now. He was uncontested there but raised 1.4 million , when I looked, and had spent 1.3 million on God knows what. But here is the shocker. He hates our nominee. He was always, as I understand it , a Boehner butt boy.

Now we just over rode obama on the Victim’s of 911 being able to sue those Saudis because they financed and provided logistics to the 911 hijacker ( including flight lessons) . We all know that now. But guess who opposed the over ride? THORNBERRY!! why? IMO— His donors want to sell to the Saudis and the fear is a quick disintegration of business relationships. That’s why!! He doesn’t care about the victims of the Saudi sunni Attack!! He just wants the money!! Welcome to the GOPe

“...so that Saudis can continue to feel superior.” I don’t think they need to feel superior. If they don’t give the animals they call “the people of Saudi Arabia” a valve to vent their violent rage then the people will turn that rage on the leaders.

To: WENDLE

But they each made BIG donations to the Clinton Crime Family Foundation so it’s OK.



To: servantboy777

Watch the Saudi Royals put their palaces up for sale and move into 1200 sq. ft. apartments. Yes, it's fitting to see them humiliated, before putting them in the wood chipper.
