Palestine: UN envoy report critical of Zionist criminal regime!

-Dr. Abdul Ruff

________

The flow of Palestinian blood driven out of bodies by the Zionist criminal regime in Mideast still continues to cause anger and outcry worldwide. The history of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict began with the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948. This conflict came from the intercommunal violence in Mandatory Palestine between Israelis and Arabs from 1920 and erupted into full-scale hostilities in the 1947–48 civil war, fueled by Britain. The conflict continues to the present day on various levels as Israel finds fictitious pretexts to attack the defenseless Palestinians.

The Israeli–Palestinian conflict is the ongoing struggle between Israelis and Palestinians that began in the mid-20th century. The conflict is wide-ranging, and the term is sometimes also used in reference to the earlier sectarian conflict in Mandatory Palestine, between the Jewish yishuv and the Arab population under British rule. It has been referred to as the world’s “most intractable conflict”, with the ongoing occupation of Palestine reaching 49 years.

The roots of the longest conflict in West Asia can be traced to the late 19th century, with the rise of national movements, including Zionism and Arab nationalism. Though the Jewish aspiration to return to Zion had been part of Jewish religious thought for more than a millennium, the Jewish population of Europe and to some degree Middle East began to more actively discuss immigration back to the Land of Israel, and the re-establishment of the “promised” Jewish Nation, only during the 1859 to 1880s, largely as a solution to the widespread persecution of Jews due to anti-Semitism in Russia and Europe.

An unwilling Israel and Palestine, affected by the Zionist criminal attacks, engaged in direct negotiation are the Israeli government, currently led by B Netanyahu, and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), currently headed by Mahmoud Abbas. The official negotiations are mediated by an international contingent known as the Quartet on the Middle East (the Quartet) represented by a special envoy that consists of the United States, Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations. The Arab League is another important actor, which has proposed an alternative peace plan. Egypt, a founding member of the Arab League, has historically been a key participant.

The Zionist movement called for the establishment of a nation state for the Jewish people in Palestine, which would serve as a haven for the Jews of the world and in which they would have the right for self-determination.

However, the Jews having become criminals by mindset and action have gone beyond their declaration to create a hell for true Palestinians living in Palestine by killing and kicking them out of Palestine. USA and Europe stood military guarantee for the Jewish Israel and genocides of Palestine Muslims, destruction of Palestine nation and steeling of their lands for illegal colony proliferation for “legalized” Jewish criminals..

USA has also mediated between the two but spoke only behalf of Israel and opposing Palestine, encouraging Israel to back off from the talks, making them a mockery. Israel is eager to attack Palestine, killing people, including children as a favorite pass time to keep the criminal Jewish voters in good humors. USA does not permit either Russia or China (fellow veto members to jointly control he world) to mediate the talks for peace.

USA and Israel have become partners in NATO global terror operations.

UN probe into Zionist crimes

Zionist perpetual crimes against defenseless Palestinians constitute is a grave violation of all human rights, values and dignity world has cherished throughout human history and Israeli arrogance displays wild animal instinct in Zionist Jewish blood.

UN constituted a committee to investigate Israeli crimes –fascist in nature and conduct- against Gaza Palestinians and on August 29 the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Nickolay Mladenov, presented to members of the UN Security Council a biting moral and legal indictment of Israel.

The Quartet’s July report actually points to the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in the same territory where Netanyahu promised before the 2015 elections that a Palestinian state would never be established. According to the Quartet’s data, 70% of Israeli-controlled Area C (which comprises some 60% of the West Bank) have been unilaterally taken over for Israeli use. The report notes that the remaining 30% is inaccessible to the Palestinians, who require permission from the Israeli military to develop those lands and build on them. Such permits are almost never granted. On the other hand, demolition orders are doled out generously. The report further states that in the first four months of this year, Israel destroyed some 500 Palestinian structures, forcing some 800 people, most of them impoverished Bedouin farmers, to leave their homes.

Mladenov accused hawkish Zionist PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s corrupt government of conducting a de facto one-state policy between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River. He complained that Israel, backed by big imperialist powers led by USA, was making a mockery of the July 1 report issued by the Middle East Quartet, which includes USA, on Israel’s systematic demolition of Palestinian homes and illegal construction of West Bank settlements and outposts

Justice Mladenov condemned Israeli colonialist expansionism in Palestine and stressed that there was no difference between Jewish settlements erected on “state lands” with the Israeli government’s blessing and those built without permits on private Palestinian land. He equated a new construction plan in the Jewish settlement town of Kiryat Arba to an expansion of construction in Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem.

Since Israeli fanaticism is deliberate, hard core Zionist Netanyahu’s reaction was no less harsh. Netanyahu does not apologize and no longer makes any effort to wrap his hawkish policy in dove feathers. He adopted the approach of his Zionist rival-partner and HaBayit HaYehudi leader Naftali Bennett. The harsher the criticism of Israel, the more aggressive is Netanyahu’s response. His brief reaction, as usual, was crammed with demagoguery, lies and self-victimization.

Like India, which now claims entire occupied Kashmir as their own and justifies all genocides in Kashmir of Muslims, its strategic partner Israel also says entire Palestine is theirs and they have the right to kill Palestinians at will and keep building terror colonies inside Israel as they wish. The strongest military power of Middle East challenges the Arab world and Iran to fight a war with the Zionist regime and win if they can- or else just surrender before Israel and do exactly what is told them of doing by Israel

Netanyahu rejected the report of Quartet and said Mladenov’s “absurd” claim that Jewish construction in Jerusalem is illegal was like saying that American construction in Washington or French building in Paris are illegal. “Did the Americans or the French unilaterally annex to their capitals thousands of acres and people in complete contravention of UN resolutions? Is a Jewish-American who resides in the eastern part of Washington not entitled to register property in western Washington in his name? Is France signatory to an international agreement that commits it to discuss sovereignty over disputed Parisian districts? Are the towns of Kiryat Arba and Ariel also twin cities of Washington and Paris?”- he asked shamelessly, and what about the outposts and settlements flourishing in the heart of the West Bank?

Israeli rulers, leaders and lay makers are liars. Netanyahu reiterated for the umpteenth time the false claim that the obstacle to peace is Palestinian refusal to recognize Israel as the state of the Jewish people and the Jews’ historic right to their land. The PLO recognized UN Resolution 181 of November 1947 on the establishment of the Jewish state alongside an Arab state. Both Egypt and Jordan signed peace agreements with Israel without being obliged to recognize the historic Jewish connection to the Land of Israel. Nor was this demand raised in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations that resulted in the signing of the 1993 Oslo Accord.

According to Netanyahu, “The Palestinian demand that a future Palestinian state be ethnically cleansed of criminalized Jews is outrageous.” Netanyahu was a member of the restricted ministerial forum that decided in 2003 to adopt the US-initiated road map for Israeli-Palestinian peace that was subsequently accorded the status of a UN Security Council resolution. Resolution 1515 includes a commitment to an immediate and total halt of construction in the settlements and the dismantling of the outposts erected since 2001. Every Jewish ruler violated all UN resolutions and USA defends all Zionist crimes and boldly stands behind Israel.

Like India, Israel which keeps attacking Gaza Strip to kill Palestinians, also calls itself the “victim” of terrorism. Netanyahu even craftily stole from the Palestinians the victimhood reserved for nations under foreign military occupation and subjected to discriminatory agrarian policy.

Netanyahu ridiculed Mladenov’s claim that all the settlements violate international law that no “legal acrobatics” could get around. On Sept. 1, as luck or the calendar of the Supreme Court would have it, the top legal court in Jerusalem ruled that Israel was violating the laws it itself had legislated. The court ordered the evacuation of 17 structures in the outpost of Netiv Ha’Avot in the Etzion settlement bloc that were built without a license on private Palestinian land. In the ruling on the petition lodged by Palestinian landowners and the Peace Now organization, the Supreme Court justices rebuked the political echelon. They reminded the government that it was not empowered to legitimize ongoing illegality.



In 2016 Israel, the judicial branch — like the political left, human rights organizations and, of course, the UN — is not considered legitimate. Minister of Jerusalem Affairs Ze’ev Elkin wrote that the top court’s judges had long ago lost the public’s trust. Education Minister Naftali Bennett claimed that the Supreme Court was being exploited by “radical left-wing entities… to impose the policy of the minority on the majority.” Netanyahu himself was silent. He is probably saving his ammunition of invectives for an informal UN Security Council Arria-Formula debate scheduled for next month on the situation in the Israeli-occupied territories. As far as he’s concerned, the dogs can bark as loud as they like. After all, they don’t dare bite.

Both Israel and USA do enjoy credibility at international level While Israel suffers isolation its strategic lord USA does not have a face to show to the world either, as its insincere mediation for Mideast peace has been a failure. Like Netanyahu who is facing problems within and outside Israel, Obama whose foreign policy has been somewhat disastrous, especially in Mideast, though it has approached Iran with some tact to avoid unnecessary tensions that could be used by Israel to its advantage. Israel’s citadel in the midst of American politics is no longer as impregnable as it used to be. Reports suggest that Israel is most rapidly losing support of the maximum section of the American as well as European public. Most westerns do not like the way Israeli military drinks the blood of even children in Palestine Gaza Strip, being systematically attacked to reduce Islamic population and loot their land and resources. .

Global Jews are against fascist Israel but Zionism is not Judaism. As Israel does not represent Jews or Judaism and it is the bigots and monsters defending Israel in the name of Jews, that even corrupts the use of the Jewish name. There is a difference between Jews and the apartheid defenders like you that want to claim being Jewish. The apartheid label is earned by the state of Israel but the biased do not like it. The majority on the earth is evolving to see for themselves why Israel is incapable of stopping crimes against humanity.

.

Israeli leaders, cutting across their politics, do not want peace in Arab world and do not let Palestinians establish a nation and ensure peace in the region. While now Israel claims ownership of Palestine, earlier Syria had done that. During a meeting with leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1976, Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad referred to Palestine as a region of Syria, as Southern Syria, not eligible for statehood. Israel tells Palestinians, “You do not represent Palestine as much as we do. Do not forget one thing: there is no Palestinian people, no Palestinian entity, there is only Syria! We don’t recognize Palestine and Palestinians.

Israel is destroying itself by living on the lie. It is why the UN and the majority on the earth are beginning to isolate the apartheid and identify the atrocities in writing. The tide has turned. But how long would the world led by USA and EU and Russia tolerate the Zionist arrogance, hypocrisy, aggression, genocides?

Bloody historic conflict

Despite a long-term peace process and the general reconciliation of Israel with Egypt and Jordan, Israelis and Palestinians have failed to reach a final peace agreement. The key issues are: mutual recognition, borders, security, water rights, control of Jerusalem, Israeli settlements,[ Palestinian freedom of movement, and Palestinian right of return. The violence of the conflict, in a region rich in sites of historic, cultural and religious interest worldwide, has been the object of numerous international conferences dealing with historic rights, security issues and human rights, and has been a factor hampering tourism in and general access to areas that are hotly contested.

Creation of Israel and its imposition in Mideast was the dramatic conspiracy of Europe and USA, both still clam to be democracies. Before World War I, the Middle East region, including the Ottoman Syria (the southern part of which are regarded as Palestine), was under the control of the Ottoman Empire for nearly 400 years. Towards the end of the 19th century, Palestine, which was divided between the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem, Syria Vilayet and Beirut Vilayet, was inhabited predominantly by Arab Muslims, both farmers and Bedouin (principally in the Negev and Jordan Valley), with smaller numbers of Christians (mostly Arabs), Druze, Circassians and Jews (predominantly Sephardic). At that time most of the Jews worldwide lived outside Palestine, predominantly in eastern and central Europe, with significant communities in the Mediterranean, the Middle East and the Americas.

Many attempts have been made to broker a two-state solution, involving the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside the State of Israel (after Israel’s establishment in 1948). In 2007, the majority of both Israelis and Palestinians, according to a number of polls, preferred the two-state solution over any other solution as a means of resolving the conflict

On the poll eve in order to get the Jews together, on January 3, 2009, the Israeli ground invasion began. The Israeli operation began with an intense bombardment of the Gaza Strip. Civilian infrastructure, including mosques, houses, medical facilities and schools, were also attacked. The operation resulted in the deaths of more than 1600 Palestinians, including children and women- a proof how much Israeli regime cares for children. . The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights reported that 926 of the reported 1,417 dead had been civilians and non-combatants

Since 2009, the Obama government has repeatedly pressured the Israeli government led by PM Benjamin Netanyahu to freeze the growth of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and reignite the peace process between Israel and the Palestinian people. During President Obama’s Cairo speech on June 4, 2009 in which Obama addressed the Muslim world Obama stated, among other things, that “The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements”. “This construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts to achieve peace. It is time for these settlements to stop.”

However, true to its criminal mindset, Israeli military continued its illegal settlement constructions inside Palestine, and killing Palestinians – considered by USA as a strong slap on Obama and Neocons nuts who promoted Israel as US policy for West Asia. . Obama, like his predecessors before him had done, gave a hope of “continuity of expansionism, also foolishly claimed the right for a “natural growth” in the existing illegal Jewish settlements in the West Bank which Israel consider as a boon or approval for its illegal operations in Palestine. Although on November 25, 2009, Israel imposed a 10-month construction freeze on all of its settlements in the West Bank, repeated announcements to commence the constructions also continued and some more Jewish “structures” have come up in Palestine,, breaking the backbone of Obama-Hillary duo. .

Meanwhile, PLO continued its effort to get UN recognition of Palestine state as a full member. During September 2011 the Palestinian Authority led a diplomatic campaign aimed at getting recognition of the State of Palestine within the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, by the Sixty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly.[On September 23 President Mahmoud Abbas submitted a request to recognize the State of Palestine as the 194th UN member to the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The Security Council has yet to vote on it. The decision was labeled by the Israeli government as a unilateral step.

In 2012, the Palestinian Authority applied for admission as a United Nations non-member state, which requires only a vote by the United Nations General Assembly. Hamas also backed the motion. The draft resolution was passed on November 29, 2012 by a vote of 138 to 9, with 41 abstentions. Regardless of the UN recognition, as of this writing, no Palestinian state exists except on a symbolic level. Israel indicated that an actual, real-world Palestinian state can only come into existence if Palestinians succeed in negotiating peace with Israel

USA and Israel opposes the establishment of Palestine state and voted against it in UN but Palestine secure recognition of UN as a defacto nation. Most of allies of US-Israeli terror twins recognized Palestine, however, giving a slap on the duo.

Israel and its ally USA wanted to show to Palestinians their joint anger over UN recognition. On November 14, 2012 Israel began nonsensical terror Operation Pillar of Defense in the Gaza Strip with the stated bogus aims being to halt the indiscriminate toy rocket fires from the Gaza Strip but they wanted to kill some more Palestine children. Several civilian houses of Palestinians were hit by the Zionist bombs and Gaza Health officials state that 167 Palestinians had been killed in the conflict by November 23. Only success of Palestine defense is Tel Aviv was hit for the first time since the 1991 Gulf War, and rockets were aimed at Jerusalem. A bomb attack against a Tel Aviv bus that wounded over 20 civilians received the “blessing” of Hamas. On November 21 a ceasefire was announced after days of negotiations between Hamas and Israel mediated by Egypt.

Egypt joins Israel in harassing Hamas

Israeli arrogance is matched by Palestinian foolishness, the refusal by Palestinian leaders to present as one nation, capable of taking care of people, nation and vital infrastructure and links.

The mismatch helps the Zionist occupier cum aggressor. Being the target of continuous attacks, Palestinians seem to have lost their mental balance as well.

While Palestinians face serious problems with Israeli military, Egypt adds fuel the crisis by joining Israel to create joint blockades to squeeze the Palestinian youth in Gaza Strip. Disunity among Palestinians a major cause of crisis in Mideast.

Meanwhile, stupid Fatah-Hamas conflict, encouraged by the foolish Saudi-Iran conflict, has been harming the chances o for real peace in Mideast. Hamas-Egypt relations are hanging by a thread amid the instability and tension between them, which some fear could result in a complete severing of ties. The latest flare ignited on Aug. 22 when Hamas members had been abducted a year ago by unknown armed men in the Sinai Peninsula after passing through the Rafah crossing. Dozens of Palestinians participated in an Aug. 18 protest in front of the Red Cross headquarters in Gaza to demand that Egypt reveal the fate of the four men. There has been no word since their abduction. The photo published by Al Jazeera shows two of the four men locked up, along with many others, at the headquarters of the Egyptian State Security Intelligence. Egypt claimed the men were members of Hamas’ military wing, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, and were on their way to Iran for military training. Hamas spokesman and leader Salah Bardawil said “Egypt is held accountable, and it should reveal their detention place.

But, so far, it has refused to disclose any information about their whereabouts and their fate.”.

Egypt is putting tough conditions on Hamas in return for revealing the fate of the abducted men. Egypt wants Hamas to cooperate with it to control the security situation in Sinai, but Hamas has repeatedly refused this demand because it does not want to meddle with the affairs of any Arab state, mainly Egypt.” Hamas-affiliated al-Resalah newspaper revealed Aug. 25 more of Egypt’s demands: First, Hamas should intervene in Sinai to fight the Islamic State and deploy additional security forces along the Rafah-Sinai borders. Hamas should hand over to Egypt Palestinians who are allegedly involved in Sinai violence. And, finally, the movement should turn over certain men in Gaza who are wanted by Egyptian security forces. Egypt has also been trying to instill internal reconciliation in Fatah between Palestinian Authority head Mahmoud Abbas and dismissed Fatah leader Mohammed Dahlan, who have been at odds since 2011.

Consequently, Egypt is not interested at the moment in rectifying relations with Hamas, although it does not want to reach a point of no return with the movement. So it is trying to control the situation, even if that means pressuring Hamas.”

Also fueling tension between Hamas and Egypt is a statement Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry issued Aug. 21, saying he doesn’t consider Israeli military operations against Palestinians to be acts of terrorism. The statement obviously was not well-received. “Whoever does not see the Zionist crimes as acts of terrorism must be blind,” Husam Badrana, a Hamas spokesman who lives in Qatar, told Al-Monitor in response to Shoukry’s statement, which coincided with Israel’s shelling of Gaza on Aug. 21. Shoukry’s comments infuriated Palestinians and Arabs, who took to social media to express their anger.

.

Deteriorating the relationship is Egypt’s continued blocking of the Rafah crossing, which has been closed since July 5. This has worsened the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, especially among the increasing number of people who urgently need to travel. The Ministry of Interior in Gaza announced Aug. 27 that Egypt does not intend to open the crossing soon, although the ministry hopes that Egypt will ultimately open it permanently without impediments.

Hamas wants to build a strategic relationship with Egypt by directing their efforts against their common enemy — Israel with which Cairo maintains normal relations and target Gaza Strip. Although Egypt and Hamas are still in contact, relations deteriorated because of Egypt. The recent events, including, Shoukry’s statements and the ongoing closing of Rafah crossing have added insult to injury, although Hamas wants to mend its relations with Egypt, but not as a result of blackmail and pressure.

Observation

Israel promotes hawkish and ultra fanatic leaders to protect the criminals who commit crimes against Palestinians, to continue the illegal expansionism and continue with genocides of Palestinians. USA the real cause of creation of Israel in Mideast and just defends the Zionist fascist regime as it duty and its criminal military operations by misusing its UN veto. That is the tragedy of Palestinians, global Muslims and Islam.

Within Israeli and Palestinian society, the conflict generates a wide variety of views and opinions. This highlights the deep divisions which exist not only between Israelis and Palestinians, but also within each society. A hallmark of the conflict has been the level of violence witnessed for virtually its entire duration. Fighting has been conducted by regular armies, paramilitary groups, terror cells, and individuals. Casualties have not been restricted to the military, with a large number of fatalities in civilian population on both sides. There are prominent international actors involved in the conflict.

A variety of studies provide differing casualty data for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, 13,000 Palestinians and a few Israelis were killed in conflict with each other between 1948 and 1997.Other estimations give 14,500 killed between 1948–2009. Also, Palestinian fatalities during the 1982 Lebanon War were 2,000 PLO combatants killed in armed conflict with Israel. More and more Palestinians would get killed by monstrous Israeli forces, reinforced by the Pentagon. .

It’s no longer a secret that Hamas-Egypt relations are closer to disintegration than repair. As long as the reasons behind the crisis — including a worsening rivalry between Hamas and Fatah — remain unaddressed, the relations are unlikely to reach the hoped-for detente. Egypt and Hamas could enter a vicious circle of pressure from Egypt and condemnation from Hamas, with both sides ignoring the potential outcome.

Even as they are the target of attacks by their chief foe Israel, the Fatah-Hamas leaders are foolish enough to fight each other, fueled by US-Israel terror twins, killing each other, making Zionist crimes look insignificant.

All said and done, sizeable majorities of normal Jews who seek permanent peace in the region and Israel see the Palestinians’ sincere demand for an independent state as just, and thinks Israel can agree to the establishment of such a state. The majority of Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have expressed a preference for a two-state solution. Mutual distrust and significant disagreements are deep over basic issues, as is the reciprocal skepticism about the other side’s commitment to upholding obligations in an eventual agreement.

PLO AND Hamas should jointly proceed further with their legal route to obtain full statehood at UN and initiate steps to punish the Israeli criminals for their crimes against humanity.

Time is running out for both Israel and Palestine.
