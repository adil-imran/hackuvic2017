The Conservatives have kept hold of David Cameron’s constituency seat in a by-election to replace the outgoing former prime minister.

The party’s Robert Courts, a barrister and local councillor, saw off 13 other candidates to win with 45 per cent of the vote.

Although Mr Courts secured a strong majority, the results are something of a departure from Mr Cameron’s success at the 2015 general election in which he was returned to his seat with 60 per cent of the vote.

The Liberal Democrats succeeded in knocking Labour into third place, representing a considerable improvement from their fourth place in 2015.

The Green Party candidate, US politician Bernie Sanders’ brother Larry received 3.5 per cent of the vote

Turnout in the Oxfordshire constituency was just 47 per cent, down 26 per cent from the general election turnout last year.

Mr Cameron quit the Oxfordshire seat last month, saying he did not want to become a “distraction” to Theresa May’s new government.
