A woman has been accused of cashing in on the death of 21-month-old toddler Mason Lee - selling t-shirts (pictured) outside of court as his mother, stepfather and teenage family friend faced manslaughter charges

A woman has been accused of cashing in on the death of 21-month-old toddler Mason Lee, selling t-shirts outside of court as the boy's mother sat inside, charged with his manslaughter.

The shirts, emblazoned with the face of the child and the words 'accountability for Mason', were reportedly being sold for $40 to supporters outside of the Queensland court.

Little Mason was found with horrific internal injuries including broken bones and a ruptured intestine inside a home in Caboolture, north of Brisbane, on June 11.

His mother Anne Maree Lee appeared briefly at Caboolture Magistrates Court on Tuesday, vowing to fight the manslaughter charges. The boy's stepfather, William Andrew Oâ€™Sullivan, and family friend Ryan Hodson, 17, are also facing the same charge.

Emotions ran high outside the court as scores of people gathered to call for action over his death, holding placards reading 'justice for Mason' and 'fly free now Mason.'

They chanted 'accountability for Mason, we want justice.'

But things got heated as some clashed over claims they were profiting from t-shirts worn by those who turned out in support.

'We are all concerned - it's not just Mason this is all in consideration of every Australian baby out there ... We will fight to the end,' supporter Jennifer Hansell said.

The lawyer of Mason's mother Anne Maree Lee, Brendan Ryan, said the 21-year-old was grieving the loss of her son and should never have faced charges over his death.

'She will be fighting the charge of manslaughter,' Mr Ryan said.

'The charge of manslaughter is the incorrect charge,' he added.

Mason's stepfather William Andrew O'Sullivan and 17-year-old family friend Ryan Robert Barry Hodson were also charged over the young boy's death.

Mason would have turned two-years-old on Monday.

Ms Lee allegedly told the officers - who visited her three days before he died - that he was staying at the home of his stepfather and claimed they were going to visit O'Sullivan's home next.

Caboolture Magistrates' Court previously heard Hodson to get the child medical attention on multiple occasions, telling one person who said the toddler needed a doctor to 'f*** your mouth up, it's not our business, it's not our problem'.

He is also said to have told another person he wouldn't take Mason to see a doctor because he 'wasn't his child'.

He is also said to have been present when the toddler was taken to McDonalds at 3am, days before he died on June 7.

Hodson is heard directing the toddler on a neighbour's CCTV footage, after returning home with the fast food, saying 'Come on c***, you walk like a spastic.'

'Hurry up and grab your f***ing bottle. Mason, get here if you want your f***ing bottle,' he allegedly said.

While there were no allegations Hodson had physically abused Mason, he showed 'no care, compassion or consideration in any way'.

Of the three charged over Mason's death, O'Sullivan and Lee remain in custody, while Hodson was granted bail by the Supreme Court last week after his second application.

Hodson will live with his mother in Brisbane's north and be required to report to police three times a week.

Hodson's approved bail caused national outrage, with over 4,000 people signing a petition to have him put back behind bars.

O'Sullivan's case was also briefly mentioned in the Caboolture Magistrates Court on Tuesday morning.

Both Lee and O'Sullivan's cases were adjourned for mention on September 28.
