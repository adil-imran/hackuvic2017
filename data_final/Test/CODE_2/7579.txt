Garcia: All schools will be ready

By LAUREL V WILLIAMS Wednesday, August 24 2016

ALL schools, both primary and secondary throughout the country, will be ready next month when the school term reopens. Education Minister, Anthony Garcia, yesterday gave the assurance while on a site visit of the New Grant (St Matthews) Anglican Primary School at Naparima / Mayaro Road, New Grant.

On Thursday last, the dilapidated school was demolished to make way for a prefabricated structure which will accommodate an estimated 196 students.



Due to health concerns and infrastructural problems on the 70 year-old wooden structure, classes were suspended on May 10. In June, members of the Parent Teachers Association (PTA) held a massive protest calling on government to rectify the situation.



Yesterday Garcia admitted that were some challenges as it related to this denominational school.



He said, having received the green light from the Anglican Board, the Education Facilities Company Limited (EFCL) intervened and work subsequently commenced.



Every child will have a place in this school. Everyone will be housed here.



The contractors are working diligently and work will be completed by next Thursday or Friday. The concrete base is being done on the site. The superstructure is being done at another venue and it will be transported here, Garcia told reporters.



Also on the tour were Minister in the Ministry of Education, Dr Lovell Francis and other officials. The team also visited the Barrackpore Primary School at Reece Road, Barrackpore, where construction work is ongoing.



On Sunday last, the PTA of the Dr Roodal Moonilal Ramai Trace Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha (SDMS) Primary School at Debe, staged a placard demonstration demanding an urgent meeting with Garcia.



Yesterday Minister Garcia promised that he will make every effort to meet with the PTA so as to settle their problems.



He reiterated that the his main objective is to ensure that every child in every school has a place.
