Malacañang has downplayed speculations the Duterte administration’s politics of accommodation had been demonstrated earlier when he removed Pangasinan Rep. Amado Espino Jr.’s name from the Bilibid drug matrix.

“If you say categorically, I cannot actually say that it was made as a political convenience because there was no political accommodation,” presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella told a press briefing.

Duterte had earlier apologized in public to Espino and Pangasinan provincial administrator Rafael Baraan and board member Raul Sison whom he accused of being protectors in the illegal drug trade.Abella said the removal of Espino’s name was based on facts that have been made available to the President.

“As far as I know, as far as we all know, there is no political accommodation. But definitely, if I know the character of the President, there is no such thing,” he stressed.

The matrix which was released by Duterte last August 25 also includes former Justice Secretary and now Sen. Leila de Lima and former Justice Undersecretary Francisco Baraan.

Abella said Duterte’s apology proved that the Filipino people can trust the President’s intensified campaign against illegal drugs.

“The point is, I think, the one that we trust is not so much the list but the President himself who has the actual humility to be able to accept that he made a mistake,” he added.

The President had publicly named politicians, police officials and judges allegedly involved in the narcotics trade, but insisted the integrity of his so-called narco list has not been compromised.

Probe on 4 ‘narco-judges’

to conclude soon

Meanwhile, the investigation on the four judges named by Duterte as involved in the illegal drugs trade in the country is set to conclude soon.

Chief Justice Lourdes Sereno made the statement yesterday, noting that she has ordered the conduct of an investigation on the four judges who are still in active service after they were included in the President’s drug list.

“We already started the investigation and we hope to conclude soon. There are four judges being investigated and unless anything concrete comes from law enforcement agencies or from the President himself, we hope to conclude the probe,” Sereno told reporters in a chance interview at the sidelines of the 3rd Asian Judges Symposium on Law Policy and Climate Change at the Asian Development Bank headquarters in Mandaluyong City.

The Supreme Court has tapped retired Associate Justice Roberto Abad to head the investigation.

Covered by the investigation were Judge Exequil Dagala of the MTC in Dapa-Socorro in Siargao Island, Surigao, Judge Adriano Savillo, RTC, Branch 30, Iloilo City, Judge Domingo Casiple, RTC, Branch 7, Kalibo, Aklan, and Judge Antonio Reyes, RTC, Branch 1, Baguio City.

Sereno, however, refused to comment further on the status of the investigation.

Earlier, the Chief Justice said even without formal complaints, they have also initiated motu proprio (on their own) investigation.
