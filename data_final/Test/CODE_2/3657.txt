Events in South Africa have once again highlighted the risks involved in investing in emerging markets.

Its currency has weakened, its stock market is going nowhere, its 10-year sovereign bond yield has jumped and the spread on its five-year credit default swap – a measure of its credit worthiness – has surged as talk of a ratings agency downgrade has begun to circulate.

This all reflects a row between the country’s finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, and its police in what some see as an essentially political dispute.

Gordhan has “refused to heed to police over allegations regarding his actions when he ran the national tax agency. After falling 3% on Tuesday after Gordhan had been issued with a warning statement, the South African rand was down another 1% yesterday [Thursday] and is at the lowest level since July 28,” writes Jim Reid, head of global fundamental credit strategy at Deutsche Bank.

Wider implications for emerging markets

This has all had a knock-on effect on emerging markets more generally. “Emerging markets certainly appear to be struggling this week as fears of a hawkish turn from the Fed have halted their rally. Global bond fund allocations towards emerging markets have reached their highest levels in four years according to Morningstar’s data,” writes Angus Nicholson, a market analyst at IG.

“The heightened low-yield environment in the wake of Brexit has seen investors seeking out yield and piling into emerging market carry trades with little consideration for the some of the messy situations these countries find themselves in. Concerns about the police investigating South Africa’s finance minister, and worries about Turkey’s newly launched military campaign in Syria have continued to sap sentiment in emerging markets,” he adds.

Indeed, emerging market risks generally are in the spotlight, according to the currency strategists at Brown Brothers Harriman. As for South Africa “the story is obviously still developing but we think the basic takeaway is that Gordhan remains under fire and that he does not have [President Jacob] Zuma’s (pictured) support to enact the needed fiscal restraint,” they write.
