ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines – Police arrested three suspected Abu Sayyaf gunmen during a raid in a remote village here yesterday.

Regional police director Chief Supt. Billy Beltran said the three suspects were able to slip though the naval blockade in Sulu in avoiding the military offensive against the Abu Sayyaf in the island province.

The three suspects were identified as Jamar Musa Maing, Ahmad Tandih Lawisan and Omar Kumbing Tandih, all natives of Parang town in Sulu.

Police surprised the suspects at their rented safehouse near the City Water District following reports they were seen carrying firearms.

Lawmen seized several ammunitions, a set of camouflage uniform, one MK2 fragmentation grenade with canister and cellphones from the suspects.

Beltran said the regional police has been tasked to conduct road checkpoints under the state of lawlessness proclamation by President Duterte.

He added that the whole Zamboanga peninsula was also placed under full alert following the bombing attack in Davao City and the ongoing military offensive against the Abu Sayyaf in Sulu.

The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), for its part, is monitoring the situation of the villagers affected by the military operation in Sulu.

The DSWD said a total of 3,423 families or 18,783 persons from Albarka, Tipo-Tipo, Ungkaya Pukan have been affected by the clashes between government troops and the Abu Sayyaf.

A total of 1,729 families or 6,218 persons from Sumisip, Tuburan, Moh Ajul and Akbar, all in Basilan, have been advised by the provincial government to take preemptive evacuation even if there was no encounter between the Abu Sayyaf and the military.

No evacuation centers have been opened since the displaced families opted to stay with relatives and friends.

The Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) has poured in more relief and medical assistance to about 4,000 families affected by the military campaign in Sulu.

Myrna Jo Henry, information officer of ARMM’s Humanitarian Emergency Action and Response Team, said close to 4,000 families from at least five towns in Sulu were displaced by the military operation. – With Jaime Laude, Rainier Allan Ronda
