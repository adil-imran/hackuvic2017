Good morning on this toasty Thursday.

Summer is coming to an end, officially giving way to autumn at 10:21 a.m.

And yet, you’d be forgiven if you didn’t notice: The sun continues to needle the eyes aboveground, and the subway is still steamy below.

Today’s high is 84, and it will feel muggy until the weekend.

For those keeping track, temperatures are running about 10 degrees above average this week. (Today’s high is normally 73) This, a day after a record high of 85 at Kennedy Airport.

The culprit: Our weather system is coming from the south, rather than the north.

“And we’ve been stuck in this pattern for a while,” said Jay Engle, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service. “It’s like the continuation of summer.”

But not for too much longer. “A crisp, cool, fall air mass will move into the city” this weekend, he said.

If this year felt especially warm, it’s because we’ve had the most days of 90-degree heat since 2010, and rain hasn’t been cooling us off: We’re still experiencing a drought.

Coming up, the cooler months look less than frigid with the Climate Prediction Center forecasting a warmer-than-usual October and late fall in the Northeast.

And warmth is something we’ll feel more of, according to the New York City Panel on Climate Change.

The panel, in a report last year, predicted that the number of heat waves in the city would double by 2050, with more extreme weather. So brace for increasingly hot Septembers.

It might seem strange now, but there may come a time when shorts, sunglasses — and scarecrows — are the norm for autumn.

And Finally...

Flavor. Portion size. Décor. Service. Ambience.

All categories that come to mind when reviewing a restaurant.

Historical relevance and influence? Not usually.

But for his new book, “Ten Restaurants That Changed America,” Paul Freedman, a professor of medieval history at Yale University, created a list of what he believes are the 10 most influential restaurants.

We weren’t surprised that many — six in fact — could be found in New York.

Like Delmonico’s, a pastry shop that Mr. Friedman believes later evolved into this country’s first true restaurant.

Also Mamma Leone’s, which made Italian food mainstream.

Or Sylvia’s, an example of how a restaurant could become a social center for a neighborhood and which still serves its world famous soul food today.

Also on the list: Le Pavillon (for its influence on French chefs), Schrafft’s (for its feminist sensibilities), and, of course, The Four Seasons, which ushered in the era of seasonal fine dining.
