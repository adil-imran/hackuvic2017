Exactly the right strategy. Exactly. Go after the left. They have screwed minorities for years, literally ruining huge numbers of lives. There is absolutely NOTHING to lose by trying to point this out to potential voters. Join TRUE progressivism - based on freedom, self-determinism, and the ability to be what you want to be irrespective of your ethnicity, color, gender, or your politics.

Trump has no chance with blacks, hispanics, jews or queers. None. You have to respect him for trying though. Dude is a tireless worker and shameless optimist. It stinks he would make a great president but will lose, and the most evil, corrupt, dangerous person in America is going to be our president for the next 4 years. My prediction? After the media is forced to cover all her corruption, Trump will come back and beat her in 2020. He is not a quitter. Reagan lost in 76 to Carter and Carter was so terrible that Reagan was swept into office. It is 1976 again. Hiltery will fix the election and win but the corruption around her will be so thick and the news so constantly bad, Trump will be swept into office in 2020. Bank on it.

You are either a fool, stupid and most like both. Obviously a product of our failing schools as well. Reagan was not the candidate in 1976, Gerald Ford did. Reagan lost to Gerald Ford in the 76 primary. Pardon me if I don’t care to bank on anything you have to say because the safe is obviously empty.

I think the rallies are the tell. If the turn out for the primaries follows history, Hillary is toast.

We are focused on winning in 2016, not “laying groundwork”, or “prepping” for 2020.

There will be no US in 2020 if Trump doesn’t win in 2016.

“Trump has no chance with blacks, hispanics, jews or queers. None. “ AGREE. Waste of time. Those clowns probably called him racist’ the second he shook their hands. “Trump will come back and beat her in 2020.” DISAGREE. There is no 2020 for us. We win or die.

The word is out that Trump is telling these folks that we should find a road to legalization for the illegals already here.

I would presume entry level and good jobs are important to American citizens.

“Trump has no chances with Blacks” ..??????? Really .. You’re not paying attention. When a black college Professor goes on TV and supports Trump .. there’s something going on.

It sounds like we have low information voters here also.

“There will be no US in 2020 if Trump doesnt win in 2016.” Bears repeating again and again.

Already complaints that he invited them to Trump Tower instead of going out to meet them on their home turf - if he showed up tomorrow to announce that he cured cancer, eliminated all nuclear weapons and has jobs for everybody who wants one, the left would complain that he was wearing the wrong colored stockings.....

There is no 2020 for us. We win or die. Hate to break it to ya bro, but America's already dead. At this point, we're just waiting for the corpse to cool.

There shouldn’t even BE “Hispanic leaders.” If there can’t be “white leaders” there shouldn’t be “Hispanic leaders.” What’s good for one race should be what’s good for all races. Do “Hispanics” have special needs and wants that conflict with what other Americans need or want? If so, that means they expect other Americans to suffer or do without, for their benefit. They expect Trump to pander to them, at the expense of Americans of other races and ethnicities. To h*** with anybody who thinks that way.

And you pulled this data out of what ass? I have been among real people for a long time and a lot of Blacks and even Gays are meandering over to the Trump wagon. Like your tagline says, Freedom is not free - we have to invest in it instead of just blowing smoke up others' butts and calling it prescience... There is a full court press to try to demoralize Trump supporters - lots of lies and lots of folks here willing to help by giving them credence. Mid September (and before) will make it a lot harder for the to spread the lies. In the meantime, we can all help him build his infrastructure and gear up for when the time for a media blitz is right by donating to his campaign and Donate to FR while we are at it. Anyone on FR that claims to not want Hillary, and who isn't also donating to Trump and FR may as well be liars who just like a free place to spout off while others do the heavy lifting. There are a lot of adjectives for them and none are flattering.....such as those who really try to demoralize our side - I call them "Tokyo Roses"

The culture and generational system of dependency with the promise of good jobs will not score well with these people. Most want the handout and not an opportunity, “I have to work for what I get for free now”? The rat progressives have done thier job well. We have a socialist system running within a capitalist one

The truth hurts. Blacks, hispanics, jews and queers are autobot Rat voters. They don’t think. They don’t discuss issues. They don’t consider candidates. They go into the booth and pull the “D” lever automatically. That is what they do. The Democrats could be caught committing genocide against them and it wouldn’t matter. They are Rat voting autobots. I see a lot of delusion here thinking “it is different this time” just because Trump’s message is inclusive. Trump’s message doesn’t matter. They hate Trump. Blacks, hispanics, jews and queers hate Trump. They are never voting for him. Blame me all you want. Call me pessimist. Say we can’t survive beyond 2016. Guess what, we DID NOT SURVIVE. Obama DOOMED us already. We did not survive. Trump is never going to get more than a scintilla of the black/hispanic/jew/queer vote. Don’t blame me. I’m just the messenger.

Your post is a bit of a fantasy... In 2012 Romney got 23 % of the black, non white Hispanics vote...5 and 18 precent... That was running against Obama.... Trump is running against a white lying criminal old sickly hag... I am sure he can do better than 23 % in 2016....
