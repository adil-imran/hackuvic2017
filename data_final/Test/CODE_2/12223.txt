Iranian President: Big Powers Playing with Terrorist Groups

TEHRAN (FNA)- Iranian President Hassan Rouhani blasted the western powers for using the terrorist groups in the region as a tool to implement their plots and attain their goals.

"The region has for years faced the problem of terrorism whose impacts have created problems for the region; in other words, the big powers are playing with the terrorists since they can annihilate the ringleaders of these groups if they are willing to given the fact that they enjoy anti-terrorism instruments," President Rouhani told reporters in a press conference in the Central province of Markazi on Monday.

He also underlined Iran's opposition to the foreign states' intervention in other countries under the pretext of fight against terrorism without coordination with the hosting state, implying his criticism of the US and Turkey's military presence in Syria and Iraq. "We see this as a problem since it stirs insecurity. We should respect other countries' territorial integrity and geographical borders."

"The (Iranian) government cares for help and rescue of innocent people," Rouhani said, adding that Iran will help other countries to the extent possible and upon on their demand.

Iran on Monday warned Turkey against the violation of Iraq's sovereignty, stressing that any anti-terrorism effort in the Arab country needs Baghdad's approval.

"Fighting against terrorism in the region and the world is important and it is good if any government fights against terrorism, but we shouldnâ€™t violate another country's sovereignty to this end," Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi told reporters in his weekly press conference in Tehran.

"Any partnership in this field should be coordinated with the central government (in Iraq)," he added.

Asked about the last week summoning of the Turkish Ambassador to Tehran Reza Hakan Takin to the Iranian foreign ministry, Qassemi said that during the meeting different issues related to mutual relations, Syria, Iraq and the Persian Gulf littoral states were raised and he promised to inform Iran as soon as possible on Ankara's positions on certain issues.

The Turkish envoy was summoned the Foreign Ministry last week to inform Ankara of Tehran's strong protest at the recent statements made by a number of Turkish officials against Iran's regional policies.

Relations between Turkey and Iraq deteriorated after Turkey dispatched its troops in Iraq allegedly to fight against ISIL in late 2015.

The Turkish government said its forces would participate in the operation on the liberation of Mosul, however, Iraqi authorities claim they had not given their consent for this participation.

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Abadi said Saturday that Turkey has sent troops to Iraq to extend its influence, but not to combat the ISIL terrorist group.

"Turkey does not fight against Daesh, it fights for its interests and extension on influence," Abadi said.

On Friday, US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said that Iraq and Turkey reached preliminary agreement on the framework of Turkish military participation in the fight against the ISIL.

Iraqi government spokesman Saad al-Hudaythi said later on the same day that no concrete agreements had been reached yet.
