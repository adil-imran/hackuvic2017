With Zach Montellaro, Connor O’Brien, Ellen Mitchell and Bryan Bender

HAPPENING TODAY — CARTER AND DUNFORD ON CAPITOL HILL: Defense Secretary Ash Carter plans to make the case for Congress to approve a spending plan that “doesn’t put warfighters at risk” in his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee this morning, a senior defense official tells Morning D. Carter is appearing with Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joe Dunford at a Senate Armed Services hearing on “national security challenges and ongoing military operations”, which is likely to cover a wide range of issues, from budget battles to the Mosul offensive to the crumbling Syrian cease-fire.

The defense secretary intends to detail recent successes against the Islamic State and look ahead to the looming fights for Mosul and Raqqa, while connecting continued progress against ISIL with a budget plan that invests in the future. “The secretary will urge lawmakers to abide by last year's bipartisan budget deal and resist cutting key investments in new and more capable systems to pay for things we don't need and can't afford over the long term,” the official said. “Echoing the testimony of the military service chiefs last week, the secretary will warn about the very real risk to the nation's security if we see a return to sequestration and the $100 billion in defense spending cuts that come with it.”

For his part, Armed Services Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) told reporters he plans to ask about a possible supplemental appropriation for ramped-up operations in Iraq and Syria. “What they’re saying is they’d have to have additional funds for their military buildup in both Iraq and Syria,” he said. “They’re going to have to come to Congress with a supplemental to pay for the other activities in Iraq and Syria.”

— DUNFORD TO PRESS FOR BUDGET CERTAINTY: Dunford telegraphed his own testimony on Wednesday, saying he’ll press the Armed Services panel on the importance of "predictable and sufficient funding." "In this crowd, I don’t really have to say much about fiscal uncertainty," Dunford said at the Air Force Association's Air, Space and Cyber Conference. The Budget Control Act "might get us through fiscal 2017, but we still have $100 billion in sequestration looming. We have also have those readiness challenges.”

WAR REPORT — THE ISLAMIC STATE IS SUSPECTED OF A MUSTARD GAS ATTACK IN IRAQ, targeting a base with U.S. troops, CNN reports: “ISIS is suspected of firing a shell with mustard agent that landed at the Qayarrah air base in Iraq Tuesday where U.S. and Iraqi troops are operating, according to several U.S. officials. The shell was categorized by officials as either a rocket or artillery shell. After it landed on the base, just south of Mosul, US troops tested it and received an initial reading for a chemical agent they believe is mustard. No U.S. troops were hurt or have displayed symptoms of exposure to mustard agent.”

— IRAQI FORCES READY FOR MOSUL OFFENSIVE BY OCTOBER, DUNFORD SAYS: Iraqi forces will be prepared to retake the Islamic State stronghold Mosul by early October, but the operation could be delayed by the Iraqi government, Dunford said Wednesday. “We assess today the Iraqis will have, in early October, all the forces marshaled, trained, fielded and equipped that are necessary for operations in Mosul,” he told the AFA crowd.

— MILITARY WANTS 500 MORE TROOPS FOR IRAQ, reports The Wall Street Journal: “The U.S. military is requesting authority to send up to 500 new troops to Iraq ahead of a much-anticipated campaign to take back Mosul from Islamic State, according to U.S. officials, adding to an expanding American presence in the country. The new deployment, if approved by the White House, would assist Iraqi and coalition forces in preparing for the battle to capture the northern city, the extremist group’s last major stronghold in Iraq.”

ALSO TODAY — SMITH AT STIMSON CENTER: Rep. Adam Smith of Washington state, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, talks national security and foreign policy at the Stimson Center this afternoon. And at the Heritage Foundation, Reps. Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.) and Steve Russell (R-Okla.), both combat veterans and Armed Services members, discuss oversight of the Pentagon from a veteran’s perspective.

U.S. AND RUSSIA ESCALATE WAR OF WORDS AT U.N., as the U.S. urges a grounding of all aircraft in northern Syria, via The Associated Press: “The United States and Russia are taking their differences over the conflict in Syria to new heights, after trading ferocious allegations of duplicity and malfeasance at the United Nations Security Council. After a fractious meeting of the council on Wednesday, Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov were set to duel again over Syria at a gathering of the roughly 20 nations that have an interest in Syria.

“Thursday's meeting of the International Syria Support Group comes after the two men blamed each other for spoiling the country's cease-fire that they had agreed to earlier this month. Each has blamed the other for violations. Kerry called for all warplanes to halt flights over aid routes, while Lavrov suggested a possible three-day pause in fighting to get the truce back on track.”

— RUSSIA’S LATEST CONVOY STRIKE EXPLANATION: “Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday an armed drone belonging to the U.S.-led coalition was in the vicinity of a humanitarian aid convoy that was hit by an airstrike Monday in Syria, countering an assertion by American intelligence agencies that Russian aircraft conducted the strike,” writes the WSJ.

— ASSAD BLAMES THE U.S. FOR THE CEASE-FIRE COLLAPSE, in an AP interview: “President Bashar Assad rejected U.S. accusations that Syrian or Russian planes struck an aid convoy in Aleppo or that his troops were preventing food from entering the city's rebel-held eastern neighborhoods, blaming the U.S. for the collapse of a cease-fire many had hoped would bring relief to the war-ravaged country.

“In an interview with The Associated Press in Damascus, Assad also said deadly U.S. airstrikes on Syrian troops last week were intentional, dismissing American officials' statements that they were an accident. Assad said the U.S. lacked 'the will' to join forces with Russia in fighting extremists.” The full transcript is here.

CONGRESS’ TANGLED SAUDI VOTES: “The Senate on Wednesday backed a $1.15 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia, even as Congress is preparing to override an expected presidential veto of a different bill allowing 9/11 victims’ families to sue the Saudi government,” we report with Seung Min Kim. “The Senate voted 71-27 to table, or kill, the resolution from Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) that would have blocked the $1.15 billion sale of Abrams tanks to Saudi Arabia, which the State Department approved last month.”

— THE HOUSE WILL VOTE TO OVERRIDE 9/11 BILL VETO…AT SOME POINT, reports our colleague Heather Caygle: “Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday he expects the House will vote to override any presidential veto of a bill that would allow the families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia, despite his concerns that the measure could touch off a wave of retaliatory lawsuits. ‘I really don’t know the answer to that question,’ Ryan (R-Wis.) said when asked if the House would take up a veto override this month before Congress prepares to leave until after Election Day. But Ryan did not say exactly when he expected the override vote to happen.”

— EX-OFFICIALS URGE REJECTION OF THE BILL, via POLITICO’s John Bresnahan: “A bipartisan group of former top executive branch officials is urging lawmakers to uphold an expected veto of legislation that would allow the families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia. The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, passed Congress unanimously despite strong opposition from the White House. … The White House has rallied support for its position on JASTA from national security and law-enforcement officials in the Bush, Clinton and Obama administrations.”

FIRST LOOK — A FEW GOOD WOMEN: Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer of California and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire today plan to offer legislation requiring the State Department to increase the recruitment and promotion of women to help manage foreign military and police training programs. “Women are grossly underrepresented in security forces worldwide,” Boxer told Morning D. “Investing in female leaders is not just about fairness, it is about the vital security interests of the United States and our international partners. And it is about protecting innocent lives. When women are deployed on peacekeeping missions, there are fewer allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation.”

The two senators, who sit on the Foreign Relations Committee, say the Enhancing Military and Police Operations through Women’s Engagement and Recruitment (EMPOWER) Act would set concrete targets for female participation in all State Department security assistance programs.

INDUSTRY INTEL — WHERE WERE THE START-UPS AT AFA? The head of Air Force Materiel Command says it wasn’t surprising more startups weren’t at the Air Force Association conference. "Why would you expect to see a millennial at the opera?" asked Gen. Ellen Pawlikowski on a panel of top Air Force generals. She explained that the "booth concept" is not the environment that the entrepreneurial community comes to.

"It’s not of interest to them; that’s not their culture," Pawlikowski said, adding the Air Force instead reaches out to startups through other means like the Small Business Innovation Research program. Pawlikowski was responding to a question from Air Force Chief Gen. David Goldfein, who had asked why there were no startups on the exhibit floor despite the military’s innovation push.
