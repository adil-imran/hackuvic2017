IG • GETTY Bishop Peter Shao Zhu Min was appointed by the Vatican

Bishop Peter Shao Zhu Min was detained by officials who reportedly took him “on a trip” sparking concern he has been transported to a labour camp. The Bishop had recently taken over as the Bishop of Wenzhou following the death of his 89-year-old predecessor. Despite Bishop Shao being recognised by the Vatican, Chinese authorities say he was not approved by the government.

The 53-year-old was preparing for his predecessor Bishop Vincent Zhu Weifang’s funeral, which was attended by more than 5,000 Catholics according to local media. Bishop Saho and three priests were arrested ahead of the service and local sources claim the men were “taken on a tour of north west China”. Up to 120,000 Christians live in the Wenzhou region with many following Bishop Shao’s government-approved predecessor. Pope Benedict XVI ordained Bishop Zhu in 2007 and approved Shao as his coadjutor which under canon law means he would take over the diocese when the bishop retires or dies. Wenzhou diocese, in the south eastern Zhejiang province, is currently divided with an underground church movement and government-sanctioned worship.

Chinese officials are said to be lining up a government-approved bishop but worshippers say they will wait for Bishop Shao to return. One Catholic from Wenzhou diocese, said: “If Bishop Shao surfaces to lead the whole diocese of Wenzhou, he has to overcome many problems, including the permission of the government, but the priests and the faithful in the open community welcome him.” The communist party strictly monitors religion with Christians expected to attend state-approved churches.

Last month Express.co.uk revealed government officials were preparing to crack down on unregistered churches ordering priests to report to the council. If unregistered churches are not willing to be guided by the council, it’s believed they will be put on record by the secretive regime under new government proposals to deal with unregistered churches. Sanctions were also imposed on Bishop Zhu’s funeral saying only mourners with permits would be allowed to attend the service. Members of the underground church were also warned to stay away from the mass by security officials. The ruling Chinese Communist Party is officially atheist with more than half of China’s 1.4billion population not associated with any religion or belief. Those following one of China’s five officially recognised religions – Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism, and Protestantism – and affiliated with one of the corresponding state-sanctioned “patriotic religious associations” are protected in theory from the government’s crackdown on religion.

But the episode in Wenzhou comes as the Chinese government wages war on Christianity. The United States has criticised China for its restrictions in Zhejiang province. In a scathing report, the US said: “Pastor Bao Guohua and his wife, Xing Wenxiang, were sentenced in Zhejiang Province in February 2016 to 14 and 12 years in prison, respectively, for leading a Christian congregation that was opposing a government campaign to remove crosses atop churches. “Over the past year, the Chinese government has stepped up its persecution of religious groups deemed a threat to the state’s supremacy and maintenance of a ‘socialist society.’ “Christian communities have borne a significant brunt of the oppression, with numerous churches bulldozed and crosses torn down.”
