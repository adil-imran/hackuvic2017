A lawsuit has been filed on behalf of two children allegedly sent home as newborns to deeply troubled and violent parents with almost no support, despite numerous warnings to B.C.'s Ministry of Children and Families.

The B.C. Supreme Court notice of civil claim says a ministry social worker approved twins KP and AP for release from Royal Columbian Hospital on in January 2004, nearly two months after they were born prematurely.

They would return three weeks later.

By then, KP allegedly had bruising on her face and blood in her mouth caused by a fractured skull. Emergency surgery was needed to remove portions of her brain. X-rays showed bilateral fractures to multiple ribs.

AP's injuries consisted of extensive bruising to the head and face and a cut above the eye.

Their father was ultimately tried and convicted of aggravated assault.

B.C.'s Public Guardian and Trustee is now suing the father and the mother as well as the ministry, the provincial director of child welfare and four ministry employees on behalf of the two girls.

"Had the defendants acted in a manner which was in accordance with their policies and standards or the duty owed to [the children], they could not have failed to discover the dangers posed by [the parents] caring for those infants," the claim reads.

"Instead, they ignored their own policies and standards, failed to gather important information which was readily available to them, failed to make inquires of collateral sources of information and minimized or ignored the risk factors that were brought to their attention."

The names of the children and their parents are protected by a publication ban ordered by the court last week.

The Ministry of Children and Families has yet to file a response. They would not comment on the case while it is before the courts.

'Unsafe' without intensive support, monitoring

The 49-page claim begins with the backgrounds of the mother and father, both of whom allegedly had extensive interactions with the ministry since childhood.

According to the claim, the 32-year-old mother had learning and emotional difficulties which may be related to fetal alcohol exposure.

The father is now 31. The claim says he and his siblings were made temporary wards of the state after reports of domestic violence and drug and alcohol abuse in their family home.

He allegedly passed through 17 foster home placements and has had a lengthy series of interactions with police related to allegations of theft and sexual offences both as a youth and an adult.

The lawsuit claims ministry social workers were negligent in ignoring policy relating to numerous warnings about the potential for abuse.

According to the claim, he punched the mother in the stomach during her first pregnancy in an attempt to force her to miscarry.

Their first child, SP, was born in 2002.

According to the claim, the couple were the subject of eight recorded "intakes" from callers concerned about their parenting before the ministry stepped in to seize their children after the twins were injured.

A temporary team leader allegedly sent an "alert" memo in the weeks leading up to the birth of the twins, highlighting concerns about drug use, sexual behaviour and drug issues.

The claim says a home visit was conducted, at which point the father denied the allegations. The workers who visited the home allegedly concluded that "without intensive support and monitoring, SP and his soon-to-be siblings will be unsafe."

According to the lawsuit, the social worker assigned to the file and her supervisor concluded that the memo had noted "no concerns."

'Very serious risk factors'

KP and AP were born at a gestational age of 31 weeks at B.C. Women's Hospital.

According to the claim, hospital social workers were worried about the eventual release of the children, as were their grandparents.

The claim says a doctor at the hospital wrote the following note on a prescription pad that was faxed to the ministry:

"To whom it may concern re: AP and KP, this family/parents require more assistance and supervision in order to prepare for the discharge the [sic] twins home from the Royal Columbian Hospital, This is an urgent matter!"

The twins were discharged two days later.

They were allegedly promised the service of a doula for up to 40 hours a week. But the claim says that didn't happen.

A public health nurse showed up to deal with lactation. And a worker from a First Nations social services agency allegedly made three visits: one for 15 minutes, one for two hours and one for five hours to drive to a doctor's appointment.

"Over three weeks this amounted to virtually no support with absolutely no parental training and minimal effective supervision," the claim says.

"Almost immediately after their discharge, KP and AP began to suffer abuse at the hands of their parents."

According to the claim, the mother later admitted that she had shaken the children and that both she and the father had hit the twins.

The claim cites a report written by social workers at the hospital in the wake of KP's extensive injuries:

"In summary, this is a situation with numerous and very serious risk factors for child abuse and neglect ... The extensive in home support services which had been recommended by various hospital staff were either not provided or were declined by the parents with no requirements by the Ministry that they accept the services."

The claim says the ministry's regional executive director for the Fraser region reached a similar conclusion in his investigation into the handling of the intake reports:

"It would appear that no matter what the circumstances of the report, none were ever designated as child protection ... No assessment of harm or risk was ever made."

The lawsuit is seeking damages for pain and suffering as well as loss of future income and the cost of future care for both children.

None of the claims have been proven in court.
