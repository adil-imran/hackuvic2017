The University of California, Irvine Black Student Union held a protest Friday calling for a total and complete ban on the UC Irvine Police Department.

The protest was in response to UC Irvines New Narratives forum, where LAPD Chief Charlie Beck was leading a talk on police brutality and race. According to the website, the event is designed to bring together leading scholars and innovative practitioners to define the problem, identify challenges, and discuss possible solutions to [police brutality.]

I guess not considering that 3 Southern California police officers were gunned down in the line of duty last week.

Ever read the entire BLM list of demands? There's a lot of black nationalist stuff you'd expect such as "reparations", but down in the fine print it is simply a demand for Communist economics. The old story. Blacks as ideological pawns for the usual suspects.

Disgusting. If they don’t like the country, I suggest they go to somalia, and take bammy with them.

They don’t want cops on campus, then so be it. Next time someone gets raped or there’s a shooter on campus, well, too bad. Sorry to say, but cops not showing up is what it’s going to take to wake these ninnies up.
