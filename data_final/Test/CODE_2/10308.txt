Thailand’s two major parties hold distinctly different ideologies, making cooperation improbable, former constitution writer Komsan Phokong said at a symposium held at Rangsit University.

He said if the Democrat Party opted for such an alternative, it could risk losing some supporters who disliked former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. As a result, the party could find itself in trouble during an election, the analyst said.

Thaksin, having lived in self-exile overseas for many years, is believed to have maintained influence over Pheu Thai.

Komsan’s observation came after Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam on Friday commented that Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha has the power to dissolve Parliament if the two Houses fail to select a new PM after the next general election.

Wissanu said to avoid such a situation, the MPs and the Senate must reach an agreement as soon as possible. Last week, the Constitutional Court ruled that during a five-year transitional period the Senate could join the MPs in calling for the suspension of political parties’ lists of candidates for PM. In the constitution draft that passed a referendum in August, the Senate was also eligible to vote to approve a PM along with the MPs.

Critics said the condition paved the way for a non-elected prime minister who could rule up to eight years. Some were concerned that it would create tension in Parliament, making selection of a premier difficult.

Former Pheu Thai MP Samart Kaewmeechai said on Friday that any government formed on such a premise would be weak and unstable.

He said Pheu Thai was hopeful of winning more seats than other parties in the House, but also acknowledged it was not possible to win a majority and form a government. Samart said if other parties wished to keep out an outsider, they could discuss and join forces to form a government.

The Pheu Thai politician added that if the Democrat Party favoured democracy and wished to see a people’s representative take the top job, the two parties could discuss the matter and form a government. Samart said he was not sure whether the Democrats were currently unified.

Former Democrat MP Watchara Petchthong, however, said yesterday that he believed the Democrats under Abhisit Vejjajiva’s leadership would not accept such a deal. He also accused Pheu Thai of being a corrupt party.

Watchara said the party highly favoured democracy and was united in supporting ex-PM Abhisit to be the next prime minister.
