GETTY The Dutch prime minister made the comments after journalists were attacked in Rotterdam

Shocking footage was released earlier this month which showed a group of men attacking journalists and their cars in a demonstration against the failed July 15 military coup. Speaking during a live three-hour interview, Mark Rutte spoke directly to the attackers to tell them to “go away”. Using the expression for “f*** off” in the local dialect, he said: “My first reaction would be: Go away. Go back to Turkey. “Pleur op I would say in Haags.”

He added that the majority of Turkish-Dutch were well integrated in the community, but there is a minority of “Turks in the Netherlands” did not try to fit in with Dutch norms or laws. But critics have blasted the Dutch leader for his comments, saying the language was un-prime ministerial. Diederik Samsom, the leader of the junior coalition partner Labour Party, said Rutte’s language was “extremely poor.”

Earlier this month the Turkish foreign ministry labeled the remark “inappropriate”, claiming the statements of the prime minister could harm integration "at a time of increasing dislike of foreigners in Europe." Although Rutte was made aware of the opposition to his comments, he chose the stand by them. The leader of the Poeple’s Party for Freedom and Democracy said he was certain others would have said the same, but realised it did not reflect the cabinet’s position. He added: “This is an opinion. I am not prime minister 24 hours a day.”

This is not the first time a Dutch politician has caused a row with bad language, however. In January last year, Rotterdam’s Moroccan born mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb told his fellow Muslim immigrants they too could “f*** off” if they could not appreciate freedom of speech. His comments were made on the day that Islamist terrorists attacked the French satirical magazine Charlei Hebdo because it published cartoons mocking Islam.
