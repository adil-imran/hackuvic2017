CEBU, Philippines - A Mandaue City policeman assigned to the City Intelligence Branch was immediately relieved after he allegedly pointed his pistol and attacked a truck driver and a supervisor of an aircon maintenance company in front of a private school along A.C. Cortes road last Friday afternoon.

Senior Superintendent Roberto Alanas, director of Mandaue City Police Office, said Police Officer 3 Renato Inot, 51 a resident of Sitio Seabreeze, Barangay Mactan, Lapu-Lapu City, will be made to explain his actions which were filmed and posted in social media.

Based on initial investigation by the police, the truck with license plate number GHD 466 driven by Crispen Ricarte, 25, who was with his supervisor Leonardo Orcullo, 27, was heading up to Mandaue-Mactan Bridge en route to their office in Cebu City when Inot, who was with a companion, overtook them onboard his red motorcycle with license plate number QC 8143.

The incident reportedly happened around 5:39 p.m. Ricarte said that when they reached the foot of the bridge in front of the University of Cebu, Inot got off from his motorcycle and challenged him to a fistfight.

"Panaugon mi didto, ngano kuno gibabag-babagan siya. Panaugon ko niya magsinumbagay daw mi, gitionan ko niya og armas," Ricarte said.

Ricarte said he left the truck after Inot reportedly pointed a gun at him. After he disembarked, Inot handed his gun to his companion, who was also armed with a pistol, before punching Ricarte in the left eye.

Orcullo said the policeman also tried to punch him but he managed to dodge the blow.

"Ingon ko, pwede ra man mi isyuhan kung naa mi violaton. Sila ni diretso og harass," Orcullo said.

Orcullo said Inot and his companion also threatened him with their guns, adding that the policeman appeared to be drunk at the time.

The attack was filmed and the video has circulated in Facebook, Inot was the one wearing a black shirt, while his still unidentified companion was wearing an orange shirt.

Glenn Antigua, chief of operations of Traffic Enforcement Agency of Mandaue said his personnel George Candunggo saw the incident from afar and went to the said area, contrary to claims that traffic enforcers did nothing.

Candunggo was on top of a skywalk adjacent to the university when he saw what happened, but when he reached the scene the suspects already fled. He then reported to the Command Center about an armed person.

Candunggo then tailed the suspects on his motorcycle but stopped doing so when he reached a mall because he was afraid Inot might shoot him.

"Gi-try niya nga moapas, wa niya naapas g'yud ka'y nahadlok siya mapusilan," Antigua said.

Another enforcer from the City Traffic Management Systems in Lapu-Lapu City also responded to the incident.

Alanas said Inot was still able to attend to his duties in the headquarters yesterday morning.

"Meron siya'ng tinarbaho kaninang umaga, nalaman ko 'to kaninang umaga," Alanas said.

After he found out about the incident, Alanas them contacted Inot but the latter did not respond to his call. He ordered all police station commanders to contact Inot to hear his side of the story.

Alanas also wants Inot to identify his armed companion.

He said Inot is relieved from his current assignment and will also have to turn in his service firearm.

"Disarmahan, i-hold po siya dito sa Mandaue Police, harapin niya to," said Alanas, who added Inot may face charges for physical injury and grave threats.

Antigua said TEAM is willing to coordinate with the police investigation and will make Candunggo and the CTMS personnel witnesses.

"Willing gyud mi mo-testify, willing sad mo-testify ang taga-CTMS nga personnel, ako man to naistorya," Antigua said. (FREEMAN)
