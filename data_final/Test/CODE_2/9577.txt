BARCROFT MEDIA Student Varvara Karaulova was in an online relationship with her ISIS boyfriend for three years

A-grade philosophy student Varvara Karaulova is currently on trial at a military court in Moscow as Russia's secret service, the FSB, suspects her of attempting to join ISIS to become a suicide bomber. The academic high-flyer is being threatened with a ten-year jail sentence for her involvement with ISIS jihadi Airat Samatov, who she wed online in a virtual ceremony.

Varvara allegedly tried to join ISIS twice to be with her jihadi lover, but was caught after she left Moscow last year to travel to Syria. She was detained on the Turkish side of the Syrian border among 14 Russians believed to have been recruited by ISIS.
