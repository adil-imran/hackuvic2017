LONDON-OPEC pumped a record amount of oil last month, the International Energy Agency said Tuesday, and officials from three of the cartel's member countries say they plan to raise output in the near future.

The increased production shows how much work the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries must do to achieve production cuts it agreed to last month in an attempt to end a crude glut that has depressed prices for two years.

OPEC's Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said Tuesday that officials will meet late this month to discuss implementing the cuts, and officials from OPEC said they're meeting with non-OPEC members like Russia to coordinate output cuts. Russia this week signaled a willingness to go along.

"Now the real work starts," the IEA, which advises industrialized nations on energy policy, wrote in its monthly report. The market-if left to its own devices-may remain in oversupply through the first half of next year, it said.

OPEC boosted its output by 160,000 barrels a day to a record 33.64 million barrels a day in September, the IEA said. OPEC last month agreed to bring its output down to a maximum of 33 million barrels a day.

But the agreement exempted Libya, Iran and Nigeria, OPEC members with recent oil-industry troubles, from any near-term cuts. Now they are presenting a challenge by boosting output at a time when the cartel wants to collectively pull back.

Last month, production from Iran, Libya and Nigeria increased by a collective 120,000 barrels a day over August levels, the IEA said. In the near term, officials from those countries say they aim to boost daily production by another 580,000 barrels or so-an amount about equal to the total volume OPEC said it would cut.

Further increases from those countries "would suggest that bigger cuts would have to be made by others, such as Saudi Arabia," the IEA said. Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest producer, saw output fall by about 20,000 barrels a day to 10.58 million barrels a day from August to September, the IEA said.

Rising production is due to a convergence of disparate factors. In Libya, a militia recently took control of long-closed oil ports and agreed to restart shipments. Libyan officials say the country's production could rise from 300,000 barrels a day in August-the baseline that OPEC used in calculating its proposed production cap-to 700,000 barrels a day.

After years of depressed oil production under Western sanctions, Iran is ramping up its exports now that those penalties are lifted.

Nigeria plans to add up to 200,000 barrels a day after it repaired a key pipeline that had been damaged by saboteurs.

Iraq presents another challenge for OPEC. It says the data OPEC uses understates recent production and could result in the country being forced to adopt an unfairly low cap.

Now, OPEC is trying to coordinate with producers outside the group.

Russia last month boosted its production to a post-Soviet high, the IEA said. But on Monday at an energy summit in Istanbul, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow could join OPEC's cuts.

"It's very important to cut the glut in the market," said Leonid Fedun, the vice president of Russia's largest non-state-controlled oil producer, OAO Lukoil, at the Istanbul meeting on Tuesday. He said his company is ready to reduce output. After Mr. Putin's declaration, he said, "all Russian companies immediately supported this decision as well."

On Tuesday, the Saudi Arabian and Russian energy ministers met to discuss oil markets, Saudi Arabia's energy ministry said. At the Istanbul conference, Russia's energy minister, Alexander Novak, said the men discussed OPEC's plans and ways it can interact with non-OPEC producers.

"At present the freezing of production is the cleverest and best way to rebalance the market to mitigate volatility risk," Mr. Novak said through a translator.

Russian media reported on Tuesday that Mr. Novak said Russia could put a cap on its oil output that could last six months or more. The Saudi ministry said the ministers would hold further talks later this month.

OPEC delegates said Tuesday that Mr. Barkindo and officials from cartel members Algeria and Venezuela are planning to meet with producers outside the cartel on Wednesday to urge them to join the output reduction. Non-OPEC producers attending will include Russia, Azerbaijan and Mexico, they said.
