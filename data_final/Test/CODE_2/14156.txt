The haunting gaze of a twelve-year-old Afghan girl, Sharbat Gula, first captured in 1985, still manages to captivate the world as one of the most iconic renditions of the turmoil of war in Afghanistan. The “Afghan Girl” Gula’s defiant expression and piercing green eyes were immortalised for the National Geographic magazine by Steve McCurry during his visit to a refugee camp near Peshawar. Last week, the poster child for Afghan sufferings again catapulted to spotlight, this time, as a ‘criminal’ in her 40s, in the midst of an intensified crackdown on all illegal immigrants across Pakistan. She was arrested by the authorities on the charges of possessing fraudulent identification documents.

Gula’s arrest has set forth a myriad of reactions worldwide. While her sympathisers including McCurry, an award-winning photographer, have strongly protested against her arrest, terming it as “an egregious violation of her human rights,” it is also being deemed legally justified by many. With a rejection of her bail plea by a special court on Wednesday on top of withdrawal of support by the UNHCR, Gula’s fate appears bleak unless the higher authorities intervene for her release. This particular arrest, however, says a lot about the struggle of Afghan refugees whose purpose yet remains as unaccomplished as it was three decades ago. A forced expulsion of tens of thousands to a country they once belonged to is considered by many as a breach of all moral codes, particularly when an entire generation identifies more with Pakistan than Afghanistan. The United Nations is, hence, quite right in warning of a humanitarian crisis as these deportees head for Afghan borders amid fears for their rehabilitation in a state still struggling to hold firm against Taliban. However, no large-scale relief funds have yet been announced despite UN’s flash appeals to undermine a worsening situation

In hindsight, countless lives could have been saved from falling prey to disorder had Pakistan, the US and the UN implemented a clear policy regarding both Afghan refugees and their future. Their effective integration into the folds of society could have been ensured if a mechanism for their children’s enrollment in schools had been made, and employment opportunities for the youth had been provided. While the country has taken pride in extending hospitality towards Afghan refugees, Pakistan did not invest much in this regard after establishing camps in its border areas. A mere provision of shelter and food supplies may suffice for the needs of animals, but these individuals required many additional amenities for a sustainable rehabilitation. Even though many refugees have already left or rather been forced to leave for Afghanistan, Pakistan along with the international community, can still strive to help overcome the crises that await them back home. The Afghan state, definitely, needs a great deal of resources — both financial and human --in resettling these refugees, especially with winter around the corner.

Despite being known worldwide as a symbol of refugee perseverance, Sharbat Gula’s ‘celebrity’ status was of no use against her sufferings throughout her life. In the light of the hardships she endured as an impoverished widow trying to raise her children, she deserves to at least have a country she can identify as home. The famous Afghan girl’s plight reflects the tragic ordeal of several millions of her fellow refugees as they once again relinquish their houses, their livelihoods, and everything they previously called their own. *
