GETTY Theresa May has been slammed over the roll out of a new 'super priority' visa

And it can be revealed the £300million project is being run by a French company leaving serious questions over Border control. Mrs May, who was last year in charge of immigration for Britain, announced while in New York this week that she plans to send £100m to Africa to tackle the migrant crisis. The Prime Minister announced this despite claims of corruption over taxpayer funds which are being channelled through Europe to war torn African nations. Now it can be revealed the British Government has approved Nigeria's entry into their rapid visa scheme which is costing taxpayers hundreds of millions to staff across their locations worldwide.

Nigerians can now apply for the 'super priority' visa for £750 which can be rubber stamped in the space of just 24 hours. This is despite the fact that the UK Government believes there are up to 29,000 illegal immigrants in the country from Nigeria. The Super Priority Visa service is offered in 23 locations across 12 countries including Kazakhstan, Colombia, China, Turkey and Thailand. In recent years the UK government has come in for scrutiny over net migration figures which now stand at 333,000. The Government insists all decision making is the same for all visa applications, and includes all of the same security and integrity checks.

But they are handing over the processing of the visa to a French company called Teleperformance, it can be revealed. The Home Office initially denied the firm based in Paris was responsible for granting visas to the UK. But they later confirmed that they in fact do operate global contracts for the provision of Visa Application Centres. The Government claims Teleperformance has no role in visa decision-making. They say: "All decisions on visa applications are made by UK Visas and Immigration staff."

But it can be confirmed that delivery of the legal documents are "returned to the customer via Teleperformance" leaving questions over checks. In a statement they said: "The Super Priority Visa service is offered in 23 locations across 12 countries as part of our range of visa application services. "The contract with Teleperformance is one of two global contracts for the provision of visa application centres and is worth £300 million over nine years. "This contract began in 2014 and has since reduced costs and provided better value for money to the taxpayer. "Teleperformance’s role is to capture visa applicants’ biometrics and forward their visa application documentation to the Home Office-run decision making centres. "Once Home Office staff have decided an application, the decision is returned to the customer via Teleperformance."

Now Ukip Mep Mike Hookem says the UK Government is engaging in "dubious" by selling access to the highest bidder. He said: "Nigerian politicians have allowed corruption to flourish with impunity. "Putting a private company in charge of visas to the UK will give bent businessmen and politicians another outlet to channel their dubious practises. "We should be looking to secure our borders to make this company safer by strengthening the UK border force and increasing coastal patrols not by selling access to the highest bidder."
