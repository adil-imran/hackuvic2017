Senate Committee Chairman on Privatization, Senator Ben Murray Bruce has indicated his resolve to facilitate a framework in which bilateral agreements would be firmly kept when a new government emerges.

Sen Murray Bruce who said this yesterday at the “Conference On Privatization/Concession Of Nigerian Airports” held at Sheraton hotel, Lagos, advised that the Federal Government should take more interest in aviation sector.

The Chairman was speaking following the conclusion by stakeholders that governments in the past have not been able to keep joint agreements made in the aviation industry.

“My committee is prepared to facilitate the privatization laws so that no new government will come to reverse what the previous government did. We cannot make progress when there is a change of government all the time”, Senator Ben Bruce said.

According to the Senator, the rate at which airlines are failing in Nigeria must be halted and this can be done by government assistance to the airlines in form of soft loans, tax reduction, patronizing of domestic airlines, secure insurance amongst others .

Acknowledging that the airline industry is going through desperate times, the Senator pointed out the industry also needs desperate approach.

“Ghana is the new aviation hub in West Africa. I have been to Ghana and noticed that the difference between Ghana and Nigeria is their ability to separate critical sectors of the economy such as power, aviation, etc from politics”, Ben Bruce said. He therefore avered that government does not have the management prowess to manage airports and should therefore, hand it over to those who have the expertise to run the airports.

Speaking at the even, former Director-General of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Dr Harold Demuren warned the government to thread with caution in the course of either privatizing or concessioning the airports, stressing that existing issues, litigations, agreements should be reviewed before Nigeria gets into trouble.

Dr Demuren however, advised the government to work with state governments so as to harness the airports in their area just as he suggested that FG should continue to dialogue with the aviation unions
