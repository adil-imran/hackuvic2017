LNG has very energy efficiency, and it is safe and has low costs on maintenance and operations, not being dependant of the land lines. LNG is also used in energy production and land transportation. It is an environmentally sustainable fuel, enabling to decrease the CO2, NOx and SOx emissions significantly and produces practically no soot particles. Tallink has chosen LNG as one of the future development directions to further improve the environmental performance of the company`s fleet and boost the industry`s development towards sustainable operations.

Megastar will be 212 meters long and will accommodate altogether 2800 passengers. Megastar will use LNG as fuel, but will also be able to run on marine diesel. With LNG, her environmental performance will improve much by creating no Sulphur or soot particles and decreasing the Nitrogen and CO2 emissions. She will be a 49 000 GT ship with a service speed of 27 knots. Designed for the Tallinn-Helsinki route exclusively, Megastar will comply with the current and future emission regulations for the ECAs (Emission Control Area), including the Baltic Sea.
