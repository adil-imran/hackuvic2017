Putin Cancels Trip To France After Hollande Accuses Russia Of War Crimes

Zero Hedge ^ | 10/11/2016 | Tyler Durden

Posted on by lafroste

In the latest confirmation of deteriorating relations between Moscow and the West, Russian President Vladimir Putin canceled a visit to Paris next week after President Francois Hollande said he would see him only for talks on Syria.

Over the weekend, tensions emerged between Moscow and Paris after the Russian UN delegation vetoed a French-drafted United Nations Security Council resolution on Syria. French officials' growing anger over a Russian-backed Syrian offensive against rebel-held areas of the city of Aleppo had led them to reconsider whether to host Putin on Oct. 19, Reuters reports.

"I made it known to Mr Putin that if he came to Paris, I would not accompany him to any ceremonies, but that I was ready to continue the dialogue on Syria. He decided to postpone the visit," a questuionably hospitable Francois Hollande said earlier at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg.

The Russian president had been scheduled to inaugurate a new Russian Orthodox cathedral and visit a Russian art exhibition in the French capital on Oct. 19, however that now will not happen as after the US and Russia broke off diplomatic relations regarding Syria, it now appears that France, or at least Hollande, has also joined.

the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the cold war has been over for 20 years. Barack Obama chides Mitt Romney for calling Russia the greatest geopolitical threat facing America. Looks like Obama was wrong about that too.

There’s no need for dialogue; the reality of the situation is that Russia is currently bearing the brunt of trying to eliminate ISIS and meanwhile the Western Europeans are blathering about how politically incorrect the Russians are behaving.

How is Russia a threat? Russia is not making anyone do anything. Russia is one of the few European countries actually doing something about ISIS right now.

The US and France have war crimes problems too - sending arms to Saudis to use on Yemeni citizens: http://www.globalresearch.ca/new-documents-show-us-knew-helping-saudis-in-yemen-could-be-war-crime/5550423

” French officials’ growing anger over a Russian-backed Syrian offensive against rebel-held areas of the city of Aleppo” How DARE a government assault a rebel held position! My only disappointment is that it hasn’t seen a TU-95 version of Linebacker II.

I don’t personally feel threatened by Russia but Obama, Hillary, and others do. I personally think Russia is threatening the petrodollar arrangement between OPEC and America and, thereby, threatening our ability to tax the entire planet by forcing the world to hold massive amounts of dollars to purchase petroleum products and then devaluing those dollars to pay for our welfare/warfare state.

Our rulers want war with Russia. They are beating the drums, louder and louder. Pajama boy progressives will buy camo or American flag iPhone cases, while young conservatives are sent off to fight their war.

What comes first...The Second American Civil War or World War 3? Or does one lead to the other?



To: lafroste

French - bunch of war-time collaborators with the Nazis. Let them answer for their own war crimes.



To: lafroste

War has often been used as the ultimate diversion for an unpopular government and as a means to further consolidate power.

“Pajama boy progressives will buy camo or American flag iPhone cases, while young conservatives are sent off to fight their war.” Conservatives should get out of the military and policing right now. We will need them for the real fight. Let them send the Trannies and the snowflakes and the safe-spacers and the Lesbians out to fight the Russians. That’d be fun to see.

the despicable cesspool that Paris has become. Eric Zemmour was put on trial in France this year simply for saying on the radio: "The Normans, the Huns, the Arabs, the great invasions that followed the fall of Rome, have their modern equivalents in the gangs of Chechens, Roma, Kosovars, Africans, and North Africans who mug, rob, and rape." It ended up with the radio station getting a warning from France's media regulatory authority.

I agree completely. Don’t forget the DAPA dreamers.

When Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, Stalin was compelled to rely upon traditional Russians, whose religion had been suppressed, economic freedom eliminated, private property mostly stolen, and family life trampled upon. Even this ruthless dictator was forced to make concessions to encourage the long subjugated masses of Russians to fight the Germans.



To: Wallace T.

Bring on August 1914. The idiot politicians are

going to lead us right into WWIII.



To: Wallace T.

I saw recently that Hitler said on the eve of invading Russia, “Just kick in the door and the whole rotten place will come crashing down.”

At first, Soviet resistance collapsed in the wake of the German onslaught. What is interesting is how the Communists motivated the Russians to fight. They used harsh measures to punish desertion, but so did the Nazis in the final months of the war. From a practical standpoint, with the exceptions of Jews and Communist Party members, the average Russian would have been no worse off under the Nazis. At least the Nazis would have permitted restoration of the Russian Orthodox Church and broken up the collective farms, restoring land to the peasants. But the common Russians did fight and die in the millions. Perhaps part of the answer is that over two decades of Communist propaganda and the long term effects of the Red Terror was to create a subservient and obedient population. Dissidents had been either dead, imprisoned, or in exile for a long time. Even Communists who crossed Stalin suffered a similar fate. Then there is the emotion of patriotism; Soviet propaganda, focused for years on internationalism, changed focus to fighting for Mother Russia. Art from the period called upon the glories of the despised Tsarist era to motivate the masses of Russians. What lesson can be learned here? Can a Hillary Clinton regime rely upon the "good old boys" of flyover country, the "deplorables", to fight a war against Russia, China, Syria, or Iran? White heterosexual Christians, largely from the South and Midwest, have provided most of the combat units from the Revolutionary War to Iraq and Afghanistan. This is a hard fact the elites must recognize if they plan to challenge foreign powers.



To: RC one

Obama and Clinton are the greatest geopolitical threat facing America. The fallout from their anti-colonialist community organizing, both in the Middle East and in the US, is sickening.



To: Wallace T.

That is an interesting question, why Russia didn’t collapse like Hitler expected. As for modern warfare, I don’t know how much modern technology has changed the situation.
