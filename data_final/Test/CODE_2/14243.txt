The man handed himself in at a police station in Taree, New South Wales, after a man calling himself the 'Coffs Coast Paedo Hunter' chatted to him online while pretending to be a child

The 'Paedo Hunter' claims the accused told him that 'age was just a number' and then asked for nude photographs.

He also claims that the man sent him pictures and videos of him performing a sex act at home and at his workplace.

In the video, the 'Paedo Hunter' said: 'I called Trent at his workplace to organise for him to come and have a look at my laptop.

'When we met, I showed him our chat log and his videos. He totally s*** himself and admitted he had done the wrong thing.'
