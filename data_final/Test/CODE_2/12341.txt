The national NAACP issued a statement Monday in response to a group of armed protesters calling themselves White Lives Matter, who held a brief protest Sunday in front of a local NAACP office in Houston, Texas.

Yesterday, a small group of white supremacists, armed with automatic weapons and waving confederate battle flags, held a brief protest outside our office in Texas, the National NAACP said in a statement on its website.

According to the Houston Chronicle, the White Lives Matter group waved Confederate flags and were armed with automatic weapons.

NAACP on White Lives Matter Protest: Misguided Sense of Victimhood Does Not Justify Brandishing Weapons Full title: They will never use the phrase (m)isguided sense of victimhood about so-called POC though.

The racists at the naacp are such hypocrites.



To: Olog-hai

Question, when whites protest and like blacks put the name of their skin color in it, how do we get to supremest?

They don’t know the difference...If it’s black and scary looking, it’s an “automatic weapon”....

NAACP talking = NAACP discrediting themselves.



To: 2ndDivisionVet; StevenCrowder

I am sure it was, as Steven Crowder puts it, a fully semi automatic weapon. http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/3460471/posts

I am offended by the use of colored people in their name. Change it as they would have us change the Washington NFL team from Redskins.

They just admitted that the entire BLM movement is nothing more than playing at victimhood. gotcha.

They dont know the difference...If its black and scary looking, its an automatic weapon....

So if you believe your life matters you are called a supremacist. Nice.



To: Olog-hai

Black Lives Matter ‘protesters/thugs’ were spitting on white people who attended a Trump event. If White Thugs were spitting on blacks who attended a Clinton Rally it would have made the front page of the New York Times. That’s why we’re victims and they’re thugs. Oh, and that’s just one example of a million possible examples... Wake up Melanie Hunter ...

Does a "misguided sense of victimhood" justify rioting or burning down the town?



To: Olog-hai

False flag. One, the only people who can protest during office hours are democrat progressive losers. Two. How do they know they were ‘automatic’ weapons? Did anyone fire them? Did they check the action for autosears?

You got that right, and if those were truly white supremacists, there would not be an NAACP office left to call and complain.
