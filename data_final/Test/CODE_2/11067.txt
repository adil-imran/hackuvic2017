The US legislation against Saudi Arabia could expose the real deep state structure behind the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, says Dr. Kevin Barrett, an American academic who has been studying the events of 9/11 since late 2003.

Dr. Barrett, a founding member of the Scientific Panel for the Investigation of 9/11, made the remarks in a phone interview with Press TV on Thursday, a day after the US Congress overwhelmingly voted to override President Barack Obama’s veto of legislation allowing relatives of the victims of the 9/11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia.

On Wednesday, Senators voted 97-1 in favor of the “Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA),” which was vetoed by Obama last week. Only Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, voted to sustain the president’s veto.

Hours later, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted against the presidential decree, 348 to 77. Only 18 Republicans and 59 Democrats voted not to override the veto.

The September 11 attacks, also known as the 9/11 attacks, were a series of strikes in the US which killed nearly 3,000 people and caused about $10 billion worth of property and infrastructure damage.

US officials assert that the attacks were carried out by al-Qaeda terrorists but many experts have raised questions about the official account. They believe that rogue elements within the US government orchestrated the 9/11 attacks in order to accelerate the US war machine and advance the Zionist agenda.

9/11 was attack by enemies of Islam

Dr. Barrett said “the US Congress had been intimidated into complete silence on all issues involving what may have really happened on September 11, 2001.”

“And the only way they were able actually to do anything was with this bill, by pretending that the people they are going after are evil Muslims over in Saudi Arabia, when of course 9/11 was an attack by the enemies of Islam, a false flag designed to falsely blame Muslims and to paint Islam in bad light to trigger one hundred years of war on Islam and Muslim countries, especially in the Middle East, on behalf Israel,” he said.

“So Congress of course cannot say that, because the media and the financial establishment in the United States are dominated by Zionists, which is of course the group that did 9/11. So instead they’re doing a sort of end-run around that Zionist power configuration, as James Petras calls it, and they are pretending that this really about Saudi Arabia,” the analyst said.

“So this JASTA bill will allow the families of victims of the 9/11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia, overriding the traditional sovereign immunity that prevents people from suing governments.”

On Wednesday, Obama said the JASTA bill sets a "dangerous precedent" in international law that could have repercussions for the United States.

"If we eliminate this notion of sovereign immunity, then our men and women in uniform around the world could potentially start seeing ourselves subject to reciprocal loss," he said.

9/11 bill to open floodgates of lawsuits against US

Dr. Barrett said “the Obama administration’s reaction against this is quite telling. They claim that this bill is a disaster, because it will open the floodgates for people in other countries who have been victimized by US-sponsored state terrorism, to sue the United States’ government.”

“So essentially Obama and his allies who are against the JASTA bill are admitting that the United States government commits massive amount of state terrorism all over the world, which is in fact the case,” he stated.

“According to the book by Noam Chomsky and Andre Vltchek On Western Terrorism, the Unites States government has murdered between 50 to 60 million people around the world in terrorist attacks since World War II -- 50 to 60 million people! No wonder Obama and his friends are afraid of losing sovereign immunity, and the lawsuits that will come pouring in against the United States as soon as this suit against Saudi Arabia commences,” the scholar said.

Why is JASTA bill ‘wonderful’?

“From the perspective of those of us who care about justice and making a better world, this is wonderful,” said Dr. Barrett, the author of Questioning the War on Terror.

“The lawsuit against Saudi Arabia for 9/11 has a chance of exposing the real deep state structure behind 9/11 – which did involve elements of the Saudi government including Bandar bin Sultan, who smoked a celebratory cigar with George W. Bush right after the 9/11 attack on the White House balcony – but also more importantly the neoconservative faction here in the United States and its masters in Tel Aviv, that’s the Israelis who were the real force behind 9/11, which was designed to destroy seven countries in five years as General Wesley Clark said,” he explained.

“Those seven countries are the so-called enemies of Israel. I hope that the entire truth will come out. I hope that the millions of survivors of US terrorist attacks around the world will sue the US government. And I am hoping that that this JASTA bill will open the door for a better world,” the researcher said in his concluding remarks.
