Industry "has implicitly... caused, the unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of healthy greyhounds'

'Even if the industry could reform, "the outlook for the industry is bleak'"

'The report is clear and the right decision has been made,' he said

'I encourage everyone to read report... I did. I didn't need to read it twice'

Mike Baird quoted at length from a special commission into the industry

When Mike Baird announced he was shutting down the greyhound industry, he said in a series of social media posts he 'didn't need to read the report twice'.

But perhaps he should have - with the New South Wales Premier reversing his decision and announcing he was 'wrong' to shut down the industry.

Mr Baird's own words have come back to haunt him following the dramatic backflip announced on Tuesday.

Political opponents have seized upon a blizzard of tweets and Facebook posts Mr Baird wrote in July where he tried to justify his controversial decision.

New South Wales Premier Mike Baird has backed down on a plan to ban greyhound racing - admitting he was 'wrong' to shut down the industry

In July, Mr Baird fired off more than a dozen tweets quoting from a scathing landmark report into the greyhound industry.

Quoting from the special commission of inquiry's report, Mr Baird tweeted: 'Even if the industry could reform, "the outlook for the industry is bleak"'.

He also tweeted 'The industry "has implicitly condoned as well as caused, the unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of healthy greyhounds"'.

He pointed out how the report found only 'eight countries allow commercial greyhound racing' and crowds were dwindling.

Another extract Mr Baird tweeted said: '"It appears unlikely that the issue of the large scale killing of healthy greyhounds...can be addressed successfully in the future.".

In his missive, Mr Baird said: 'I encourage everyone to actually read the report into greyhound racing. I did. I didn’t need to read it twice.'

'I feel deep empathy for innocent participants & we will work to support them. But the report is clear and the right decision has been made.'

Many of the tweets were resurfaced on Tuesday as Mr Baird confirmed his government was backing down.

NSW Greens Senator Lee Rhiannon pointed out a tweet where Mr Baird quoted from the special report.

'Giving the industry further time to address overbreeding and “wastage” appears likely to be fruitless,' Mr Baird's tweet said.

Ms Rhiannon quipped: 'Mike Baird, three months ago. Today, he abandons principle to save his own skin.'

Former NSW Labor Premier Kristina Keneally quoted a July tweet where he declared: Ending this cruelty is simply the right thing to do'.

Ms Keneally said: 'Apparently re-instating it is an even better thing to do.'

The NSW cabinet has signed off on plans to REVERSE the ban on greyhound racing

The ban was previously due to come into effect in July next year. Now it will not

The Premier told a press conference: 'I got it wrong. The Cabinet got it wrong. The government got it wrong'.

He said the greyhound industry would be given 'one last chance'.

Mr Baird instead promised to introduce stronger regulations for the industry, including harsher penalties for animal cruelty.

He said he previously thought the industry could not reform itself - but said Greyhound Transition Taskforce Co-ordinator-General John Keniry suggests it can.
