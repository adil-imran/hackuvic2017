Ibrahim Apekhade Yusuf recounts fond memories of Facebook’s founder Mark Zuckerberg’s visit to Lagos

The two-day whistle stop visit last week by Facebook’s Chief Executive Officer, Mark Zuckerberg, to Lagos and Abuja, in one of his first visits to sub Sahara Africa, is instructive. He made quite an impression and may have left indelible marks on the minds of the people he met during the brief encounters.

Although a world renowned celebrity, he came into the country without the usual razzmatazz and fanfare you would expect from a man of means. His visit was shorn of all the media blitz as well.

When The Nation visited the headquarters of Co-Creation Hub, Yaba, Lagos, the local innovation centre, where the Facebook’s chief made his surprise visit, there were no visible traces to show that they had welcomed a VIP during the week.

But of course, for those who had personally met and received the August guest, the memories lingered still.

Speaking with Adebayo Adegbembo, one of the software developers who met the tech guru, you could tell he was still savouring every moment of their encounter.

“One would have expected that as a ‘big man’ by every standard, he would have announced his visit with some kind of hullabaloo but he came in unannounced to the surprise of everybody. Nobody around was expecting such a calibre of a person in our midst,” he recalled.

“Here was a man who did not come with gun-toting policemen and all the bodyguards of this world. He put on no airs whatsoever.”

Adegbembo who is the founder of Genii Games, a platform to make it easier for kids to learn about African culture both in Nigeria and the Diaspora, said Zuckerberg came in donning just a jean and a T-shirt you would see on any regular guy. Such, he said, was totally surprising.

“I guess the long and short of everything about him was his simplicity. There was no cosmetic about it, or anything fake. The interesting thing again for me is that having met that kind of August visitor, at first it doesn’t hit you but later you sit back and say to yourself, come, did I really meet someone as great as Mark Zuckerberg? C’mon that guy is richer than many nations of the world put together!

“When I shared it on Facebook for example, the number of shares and likes it attracted was just so much. You had a lot of people commenting and all that… And having him come to this place, straight from the airport and down here, says a lot about the ideals he stands for. I think the takeaway for me is that you can keep doing your own thing and not know anybody and someone who understands what it takes would come all the way to add value to that thing you’re doing and trace you to wherever you’re even if it’s in one thick forest…For me, young people recognised him as a hero. I don’t know who would have driven that kind of movement. I don’t know if it’s a Buhari or anyone else here…”

For Bayo, the one thing he is very proud of is getting the imprimatur of support from the Facebook originator himself.

Echoing similar sentiments, Tunji Eleso, one of the Directors at CCHub, who also met with Zuckerberg, said he was the catalyst the centre had been waiting to turn things around for good.

“Most importantly, Mark’s visit for us is a big stamp of approval on the technology ecosystem as a whole, especially for people who have been here for the last five years, people sweating and toiling trying to create the future they want to see. So this visit is so pleasant to us particularly because it’s the first place he visited on his first visit to the continent. That shows there’s a lot more that can come out of here.”

Besides CCHub, the Facebook founder also visited another company, Andela in Lagos, just a stone throw from CCHub. Andela, a company that recruits the most talented technologists in Africa and embeds them into engineering organisations worldwide, had received $24milion in Series B funding in June led by Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI).

When The Nation visited Andela, the unofficial account by some of the staff was that an uncommon visitor had come.

“We were not expecting anybody of his calibre. But what were told that a staff of his company was coming. Of course, when it was confirmed that he was around the staff were asked to stay wherever they were. Only the top level staff were allowed to receive him. We were also told not to take selfies too,” one of the staff who asked not to be named confided in The Nation.

However in response to an enquiry, Mohini Ufeli in an email said Zuckerberg met with Seni Sulyman, Director of Operations, and Nadayar Enegesi, Director of Learning & Development, to discuss the learning science powering Andela and the company’s success placing world-class African software developers with technology companies around the world.

He was also said to have sat down with Andela developers Innocent Amadi, who runs the Facebook Lagos Developer Group, and Blessing Ebowe to learn about the highlights and challenges of being a software developer in Lagos.

“We were excited and honoured to welcome Zuckerberg to Lagos,” said Sulyman, Director of Andela Lagos. “His visit reinforces not only his support of Andela’s mission, but his belief that indeed the next generation of great technology leaders will come out of Lagos, Nigeria and cities across Africa.”

At the Landmark Event Centre, Victoria Island, Zuckerberg had an interface and discussion session with Nigerian software developers and tech entrepreneurs.

Of course, he capped his visit by going to Aso Rock, where he met with President Muhammdau Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.

The president, who could not hide his excitement, said he was impressed by the Facebook founder’s humanness. “I am impressed by your simplicity in sharing your knowledge and wealth with those with less income,” he said. According to him, the simplicity and magnanimity of the entrepreneur, who is among the world’s richest men, has also challenged the culture of lavish wealth display and impulsive spending that has become peculiar to Nigerians.

“We are not used to seeing successful people appear like you; we are not used to seeing successful people jogging and sweating on the streets. “We are more used to seeing successful people in air-conditioned places; we are happy you are well-off and simple enough to always share.”

The import f the visit would continue to ricochet in the Nigerian tech world for a long while.
