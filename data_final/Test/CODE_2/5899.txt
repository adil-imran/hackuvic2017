A German undercover journalist enrolled as an intern at the RT Deutsch studio to spy on "Putin's propaganda broadcaster," but things didn't exactly go as planned.German youth magazine Neon planted journalist Martin Schlak at the RT Deutsch office in Berlin. His mission was to find out how "Russia's truth" - to use his own term - is being made."I'm a spy," Schlak admits.He writes he was eager to learn if RT's daily work would live up to the terms used by German mainstream media to describe it, such as "Putin's propaganda broadcaster" and "the Kremlin's weapon of hybrid warfare."To do that, Schlak enrolled as an intern and became "Putin's man" for several weeks."What did I actually imagine would be there? A fax in the middle of the newsroom, sending orders from the Kremlin every minute?" Schlak asks himself ironically.Reality turned out to be a bit more mundane. The self-styled spy mentions friendly co-workers, coffee machines and an intelligent chief editor speaking perfect German."I'm asking myself whether you're a spy sent to us by the Bild newspaper," an RT Deutsch employee joked, given how many questions Schlak was asking.Fearing for his guise, the 'mole' tried to act by the playbook - but then something quite unexpected happened."Deutsche Welle is the taxpayer-funded international broadcaster in charge of giving coverage to the German and other perspectives on politics, culture and economy," his article goes on. "Is it exactly the same what RT is doing, to promote understanding of Russia's position?""Do I rashly call it propaganda because Russia, this giant kingdom, is foreign to me?"He turned to Markus Appel, a psychology professor at the University of Koblenz-Landau."A human being has an inclination not to comply with the majority," Appel said, citing a number of scientific experiments that examined human behavior in groups.RT Deutsch - RT's German branch - was launched in November 2014 to offer the German audience an alternative to mainstream online news and comments. Before it was launched, over 30,000 people signed a petition for RT to start a German-language channel.In 2015, RT Deutsch's YouTube channel had over 20 million views and 44,000 subscribers.The channel immediately drew criticism from German politicians, who claimed that its programs were one-sided and "biased towards Russia's position." This even led to a probe into a regional channel that aired an RT Deutsch show. No breach of broadcast laws was found.The mainstream German media's own bias against Russia has been exposed in numerous cases. In February 2016, a retired head of the popular German broadcaster ZDF, Dr Wolfgang Herles, admitted the network and other German media outlets take orders from the government on what, and what not, to report.During the Ukrainian crisis, the head of the influential Süddeutsche Zeitung's foreign policy department, Stefan Kornelius, put himself in the spotlight by taking an extremely one-sided stance in numerous reports.
