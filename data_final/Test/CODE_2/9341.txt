The Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Matthew Hassan Kukah, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to work on resolving Nigeria’s economic woes.

He also told Buhari to stop blaming the former President Goodluck Jonathan’s administration for the current economy recession.

Kukah, spoke with reporters at the Catholic Bishops Conference Dinner Night held at the International Event Centre, (DOME) in Akure, the Ondo State.

The Bishop said, “the previous government did not only do bad things; he did a lot of good things.

“And I think the business of government is not our business; our business is if the previous government did bad, that is why we voted a new government.

“We did not vote a government to complain about yesterday. If we wanted yesterday, the new government would not be there. It is really about taking responsibility.

“No matter how much you praise or abuse Jonathan, he is not the President of Nigeria. I think that people must understand that you take power to solve problems not to agonize.

“As the head of a family, no matter how bad things are: no food in the house; you as a father cannot enter the house crying.

“It is the question of developing the mechanism, else you can’t solve the problem.

“Even my best friends in APC now realize that nobody can sing the song about Jonathan being responsible for the problems we are in.

“We are not asking you to change the whole world, but Jonathan created problems: we are now riding a train between Abuja and Kaduna now; the train was not there before.

“Things that Jonathan did that can help Nigeria, let us continue with them.

“The bad things that Jonathan did and those who deserve to go to prison should go to prison.

“But sending people to prison will only be useful if it puts bread on the table of people”.

Governor Olusegun Mimiko, who was at the event in his remarks stressed on the need for the government and the people to diversify the economy.

He, however, said that the only solution to the crisis rocking the country is restructuring.
