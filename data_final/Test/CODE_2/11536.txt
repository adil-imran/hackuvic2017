Incident leads to heated exchange of words; visitors forced to turn back

ild trouble ensued outside the University of Hyderabad’s (UoH) main gate when activist Teesta Setalvad and three Lok Sabha MPs from Kerala were prevented from entering the campus by security personnel. The incident led to a heated exchange of words, after which the gate was literally locked for over an hour by the security personnel, forcing Teesta and the others to turn back.

“I reached UoH around 1 p.m., after which I was not allowed inside. I was invited by some faculty members to talk about human rights, communal conflicts etc. After that, Prof. K. Y. Ratnam had come outside to escort me in, and the security personnel had even agreed to let me in. But when I told them my name, they said that I was not allowed inside,” recalled Teesta, who later addressed students outside the gate.

The Lok Sabha MPs who tried to enter the UoH campus were M. P. Rajesh, P. K. Biju and A . Sampath (CPI-M).

The incident led to a commotion for a while, as students objected to the gate being locked up.

After a day of violent protest on March 22 at vice-chancellor Prof. Appa Rao’s lodge, the varsity administration had clamped down on entry of all outsiders, journalists and politicians.

When contacted, a UoH official said that there were no plans to ease the restrictions on entry of outsiders as of now. “There is an order by the administration and depending on the situation, it will be withdrawn later,” he added.

It has also emerged that at a meeting held on March 24 between the VC, deans of schools and other UoH officials, the administration had decided to remove ‘unauthorised things’, i.e. the set-up at ‘Veliwada’ or the ‘Dalit ghetto’ from the Shopcom area. On asking if the varsity will go ahead and take action soon, the official said, “There is no such plan as of now to remove anything from there.”
