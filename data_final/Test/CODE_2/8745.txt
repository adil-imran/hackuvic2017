Rawalpindi - Police yesterday obtained four days physical remand of three accused, arrested in connection with stealing kidneys, from a court of law.



The accused were brought from Adiala Jail for court proceedings.

According to details, a police team produced the accused before the court of Magistrate Waqar Mansoor Baryar and pleaded for physical remand for four days.



The judge while accepting police request granted four days remand of Zafar Iqbal, the owner of the plaza, Faqeer Hussain and Shehzad Qayyum alias Shani.



The investigators in their request for physical custody stated that they wanted to interrogate the men for recovery of valuable things taken away from the detained persons.

They said that they wanted to question the accused to get information.



Furthermore, the magistrate turned down post-arrest bail plea of Balqees Bibi for her alleged involvement in the case of kidnapping and detaining 24 persons including four women in the basement of a plaza for purpose of removing their kidneys.



Rawat police had to have a legal battle to obtain the physical remand of the three accused who were arrested on October 15 from a private housing society.



The police had already sealed Kidney Centre Morgah where allegedly operations were to be carried out for illegal transplantation of kidneys.

Police, however, are yet to arrest accused Dr Zahid Iqbal, Dr Mukhtar Ahmed, Dr Tauseef Ahmed, and Laeeq Ahmed, cashier of the kidney centre.



A day ago, Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Amjad Iqbal Ranjha granted physically remand of three alleged members of a kidney racket for three days.

The accused were held by police for detaining 24 persons in a private plaza for stealing their kidneys with the help of a racket operating in twin cities.

The accused including Zafar Iqbal, owner of the plaza, Faqeer Hussain, Shehzad Qayyum alias Shani and Balqees Bibi are detained in Adiala Jail on judicial remand.

The court, however, said that under the law the police could not obtain physical remand of the woman.



According to details, ADSJ Amjad Iqbal Ranjah allowed police for obtaining further physical remand of the accused while accepting the plea filed by the police against the decision of a magistrate who sent the arrested accused to the jail on judicial remand and denied further physical remand on October 17.



In his order, ADSJ Amjad Iqbal Ranjah noted that one day physical remand was not sufficient for the police to complete their investigation and the investigators needed more time to complete the investigation.
