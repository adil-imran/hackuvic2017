The Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) has submitted a letter to the National Election Committee (NEC), asking them to help Cambodian migrant workers in Thailand to register to vote in communes along the Thai border.



The letter, signed by acting party president Kem Sokha yesterday and sent to NEC president Sik Bun Hok, said Cambodian workers employed in Thailand have come to the border almost every day trying to register to vote after hearing appeals from the NEC and government leaders.



Due to money and time constraints, almost all are unable to travel to their home provinces from the border. Instead, they have asked government officials whether they could register to vote in communes along the border.



The letter says border officials made registration efforts difficult and they had tried to dissuade people from registering to vote in next year’s elections after a number of Cambodian migrant workers asked to be allowed to register in communes near their workplaces in Thailand.



“We request that the National Election Committee intervene for Cambodian workers who are working in Thailand and want voter registration at polling stations located in communes near the Cambodia-Thailand border in accordance with the law,” the letter says.



The CNRP says that on July 9 and on Sunday, about 600 Cambodian migrant workers in Thailand came to register to vote in commune offices along the Cambodia-Thailand border in Battambang and Banteay Meanchey provinces.



But commune chiefs in those areas refused to give out living certificates – a document necessary for voters trying to register – and turned them all away.



The letter adds that to ensure the voting rights of every Cambodian citizen, as stipulated in the constitution and Election Law, the NEC must rectify this situation and allow migrant workers to register to vote in communes along the border with Thailand.

Koul Panha, president of the Committee for Free and Fair Elections in Cambodia, said officials had difficulty in the past when it came to the locations for voter registration for populations that did not work in their home communes.



The issue cropped up recently concerning soldiers and the NEC was forced to say that army units could vote in the communes closest to their garrisons after local residents expressed fears of roving military trucks full of soldiers moving through the streets on election day next year.



If they can do this for soldiers, the NEC should cooperate with authorities to implement a confirmed living certificate for Cambodian workers who need to register near their jobs, Mr. Panha said.



“In the future, they also need to discuss and change some voter registration systems allowing people to register where they live or allowing them to arrange for registration in Thailand and to confirm the place where they live and transfer the data through computers so they can register from anywhere for everywhere.



“They need to have a place to vote with their identity card,” he said.



The government has given several reasons for the lack of an absentee voting system for voters who live abroad. NEC officials say it would be expensive to register voters and set up polling stations in embassies and argue that there is also a large risk of voter fraud.



But analysts say that political influence – not the high price tag – is the real reason Cambodia still has no absentee voting system.



“It’s not a problem of financial commitment, it’s a problem of political commitment,” Mr. Panha told Khmer Times last year. “It’s not easy for political parties to control [voters abroad] or influence them. They live far from here, from the [political] campaigns and engagement.”



“Many [voters abroad] don’t like the ruling party,” said Sourn Serey Ratha, the head of the Khmer People Power Movement. “If the ruling party allows the overseas people to vote, then they will not vote for them.”



Opposition party members have aired concerns in the past about the government’s refusal to create systems that would allow Cambodia’s sizable expatriate population to vote in elections. Some within the opposition say the government’s refusal is rooted in the fact that most Cambodians living abroad are to varying degrees supporters of the CNRP.



NEC spokesman Hang Puthea did not respond to requests for comment.



The NEC announced that an estimated 5.85 million people have registered to vote after the first 47 days of voter registration, representing almost 60 percent of the country’s voting-age population.
