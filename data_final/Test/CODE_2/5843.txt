Theresa May admitted today she knew of 'tension' between members of the child abuse inquiry and its chair when she was still Home Secretary but defended her decision not to intervene.

She has come under increasing pressure to explain what and when she new of concerns raised by members of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) over the New Zealander chair Dame Lowell Goddard, who quit in August.

Earlier this week she said she only knew of 'stories around about the inquiry' but said it would have been wrong of the Home Secretary to intervene 'on the basis of suspicion, rumour or hearsay'.

Theresa May (pictured giving a press conference in Brussels today) admitted she knew of 'tension' with the child abuse inquiry chair when she was Home Secretary but defended her decision not to intervene

But pressed on the when she became of the concerns today, she went a step further and said: 'I was aware of tension between the inquiry panel and the chairman, but I was also very clear - and it is clear - that the Home Secretary cannot intervene in a judge-led public inquiry on the basis of suspicion, of rumour or of hearsay.

'When the Home Office was officially made aware of issues, then the Home Office acted on these issues.'

At a press conference after her EU summit in Brussels today, she said: 'Let's just remember why this inquiry was set up and why I set it up, which is that there are people in the United Kingdom who suffered sexual abuse as children who for many years have been searching for justice and who have sadly had the experience that their voice has not been heard and they have not been given justice.

'We owe it to victims and survivors to ensure that they can have that justice.

'For many of them, they have felt over the years that people in positions of power have intervened to stop their voice being heard. And that's why it is absolutely crucial that people in positions of power do not just intervene on the basis of hearsay and rumour.'

The inquiry raised 'concerns' over New Zealander chair Dame Lowell Goddard (pictured) with a Home Office official in April, MPs were told earlier this week

Earlier this week the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee heard that concerns about Dame Lowell were raised with a senior Home Office official as April - months before she resigned in August.

But the department's top mandarin, Mark Sedwill insisted he was completely unaware of the worries until the end of July.

Some MPs remain angry that when current Home Secretary Amber Rudd appeared before committee last month she made no mention of the issues that had been raised, saying simply Dame Lowell had resigned because she was homesick.

At yesterday's set-piece evidence session, the new chair of the troubled inquiry, Professor Alexis Jay, hit out at her predecessor Dame Lowell.

She said Dame Lowell had shown little interest in working with the expert panel, and it would have been 'very difficult' if she had not quit.
