New Delhi:JNU Students Union on Monday approached the varsity Vice Chancellor seeking action against a student who has been accused of sexual assault by a fellow mate. A 28-year-old JNU student had yesterday approached Delhi Police and filed a rape case against an activist of the left-affiliated All India Students Association (AISA), accusing him of raping her in a hostel room on the university campus. The woman, a Ph.D student, alleged that Anmol Ratan, also a Ph.D student, offered her a copy of a that she was looking for, took her to his hostel room and offered her a spiked drink. She told police that he raped her when she was unconscious. He also threatened her and asked her not to report the matter. Taking strong note of the incident, AISA had on Sunday expelled Anmol from the party which ended his primary membership. "We condemn the incident and call for speedy action in the case. Since the complaint has been filed with police, we demand that the force takes all necessary steps to ensure justice and arrest the accused without delay. Also, the University must take necessary action against the accused student," a statement issued by JNU Students Union (JNUSU) said. Meanwhile, the complainant could not record her statement before the magistrate citing illness. "The victim was sent for recording of her statement before a magistrate under Section 164 of CrPC but she cited illness due to which it has been postponed now," said RP Upadhyay, Jt Commissioner of Police, southeastern range. He said that the statement is expected to be recorded on Tuesday. The accused student has not joined the probe and is unavailable for questioning, he added. The university authorities condemned the incident as a blot on the university's image and urged the JNU community to remain vigilant against such incidents. "JNU administration strongly condemns an incident of heinous rape in a campus hostel. It has completely shaken the JNU community and has tarnished the image of the university. "The administration does not tolerate such incidences and resolves to take appropriate measures to prevent them in future. We appeal the students, staff and teachers to remain vigilant against such incidences," an official statement said. The BJP's student wing-ABVP which is locked in an ideological battle with the left-groups on campus on Monday staged a protest in university demanding rustication of Anmol. They also submitted a memorandum to Vice Chancellor Jagadesh Kumar in this regard. "We will not let JNU become a rape capital. The way these people conduct anti-national activities on campus similarly they indulge in rapes and are habitual offenders," alleged a statement from ABVP.
