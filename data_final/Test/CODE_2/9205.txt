Actor Amitabh Bachchan refused to comment on the political call to ban Pakistan actors in the wake of the Uri terror attacks. Addressing the media on his 74th birthday, Bachchan said, “This is not the time and I don’t think it is right to put forward these questions. Who said what, where and how… this is not the time.”

Standing by the army in these troubled times, Bachchan echoed the sentiments of Akshay Kumar and said, ” The nation is incensed we all know that. People of this country are very angry by the incidents that have been happening at the border. I think it is the time to show solidarity to our jawans and our armed forces who are sacrificing their lives so that you and me can be safe here. That is what needs to be put in question. Nothing else.”

While few have opined that actors from across the border should issue strong statements condemning terrorist attacks, others have vociferously protest against the ban. Radhika Apte recently expressed that banning Pakistani actors is not the solution. “Pakistani actors should also be allowed to come here and do films in India. I don’t think they should be banned,” the actress opined.

I’ve received numerous requests from the media and from well wishers worldwide asking me for my thoughts on the sad incidents that took place in the past few weeks. As a father of two little children, I pray and wish like many others that together we can build and live in a more peaceful world. I believe we owe it to our children who will shape our tomorrow. This is the first time I have spoken on the matter. Please disregard any other words attributed to me during this time because I have not said them. I thank all my fans and fellow artists from Pakistan, India and people in general all over the world who have shown continued support for their belief in love and understanding to unite a divisive world.”

I will always hope for and dream of a world where my child can live without it, and always plead with everyone to imagine a peaceful world. It has also been in this time my faith in saner minds and goodness has been restored, thank you for the messages, love and support.”
