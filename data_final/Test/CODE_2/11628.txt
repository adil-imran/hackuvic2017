She's been enjoying a relaxing holiday in the States, after quitting reality show, The Only Way Is Essex earlier this year.

And Jessica Wright looked incredible as she put on a stylishly slender display in Los Angeles on Monday night.

The TV personality, 30, showcased her svelte legs in some white skinny jeans as she headed for dinner at upmarket Koi restaurant.

The Essex lady looked stunning in some white skinny jeans, showing off her enviable pins, and a matching white off-the-shoulder blouse.

The top, which hung loosely around her womanly curves, bared her decolletage and shoulders, showing off her new golden tan picked up from the trip.

The blouse was adorned with candy-coloured tassels hanging off a crochet lining at its top hem, adding a pop of colour to the bright white look.

Jess paired the outfit with one of her own creations - the Allegra nude t-bar heeled sandal from her own collection Jessica Wright Footwear, released last year.

The former TOWIE star kept the simple look trendy with a funky denim clutch bag, complete with a vibrant green lining and sophisticated chain strap.

Keeping things co-ordinated, Jess accessorised with some huge gold hoops, bracelets and rings, picking up on the metallic detailing of the shoes and bag.

Styling her hair into a sleek blow-dry and sporting some hot pink lipstick, the brunette beauty did not look out of place in the glamorous Hollywood location as she headed into the swanky Japanese eatery.

Jess appears to be having a ball over in the USA, documenting her luxurious getaway for fans on social media.

Having been spotted soaking up the sun in Las Vegas last week, Jess took to Instagram to reveal she had moved on to glitzy Los Angeles, by posting a snap of her spinning excitedly on the streets of Beverly Hills.

Beaming in a glamorous white mini dress, Jess announced to fans in the caption: 'Everything's better with palm trees & sunshine'.

It seems Jess is embracing the single life, too, as she enjoys her American adventure not with a lover but with a multitude of close pals instead.

Spilling all on her love life to MailOnline back in February, Jess teased: 'It's always exciting. There's always potential guys, but I'm really, really waiting for the right one.'

She explained: 'I don't want to rush into anything and settle down with someone for the sake of it or on a whim. I genuinely am happy living on my own and being independent.

'My career is the main thing at the moment and it would take someone quite special to make me settle down.'

Having recently quit ITVBe's The Only Way is Essex after six years to pursue other projects, Jess recently confirmed that she has no plans to return to reality TV.

Addressing recent rumours after a one-off appearance on TOWIE last month, Jess revealed to OK!: 'It's so annoying! I was filming a one-off with (my dog) Bella and Bobby [Norris] as his dog Beau passed away.

'I'm definitely not going back â€“ if anything, appearing with Bobby cemented why I wanted to leave.

'It was a brilliant period of my life but it's done and dusted.'
