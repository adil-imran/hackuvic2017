Residents of a rural Idaho town are fighting to stop a camp for children with cancer from purchasing property in the area, due to fears it would increase traffic.

Camp Rainbow Gold announced in August they planned to purchase the $3.75million property in the neighborhood of Triumph for its first-ever permanent campsite.

Directors of the camp said the grounds in the Sawtooth Mountains were nearly perfect, located just 10 miles away from the hospital but with plenty of land to offer the children freedom.

A permanent location would also allow Camp Rainbow Gold, which currently leases land on two campgrounds near Ketchum, to specifically design cabins and other structures for the property and increase the length of time children can stay.

Elizabeth Lizberg, the camp's executive director, said it would allow the children to get around easily and 'make them realize they're just like every other kid'.

'There's no camp in Idaho designed for medical children,' she told the Idaho Mountain Express. 'That's huge.'

There seemed to be only more good news for the camp when partial property owners Rich and Nancy Robbins offered to donate their portion of land to Camp Rainbow Gold, worth $1.76million of the property's price tag.

And yet many residents of Triumph believe the camp, whose activities would mainly run from May to October, would be throwing the neighborhood 'under the bus'.

Dozens voiced their opposition at a community meeting last week, sighting concerns about sewage and the effect wildfires in the area could have on the children.

But many made it clear that an increase in traffic was the issue they were worried about most.

And when camp directors laid out the plans for 22 months of construction, which would include 14 cabins and 11 other camp buildings, there was only more opposition.

Lizberg said a permanent location would not increase the amount of campers attending Rainbow Gold, approximately 80 per camp, as the nearby hospital can only accommodate so many potential patients at once.

And camp board members argued that the property was a beautiful escape for the kids in an area where the camp has had a major donor base in the past, according to the Idaho Mountain Express.

But some donors at the meeting have already threatened to pull their support if the camp's board goes through with purchasing the East Fork location.

'To hear that people want us to leave, that's hard to hear,' Lizberg said.

The decision is ultimately up to the Blaine County Planning and Zoning Commission and Lizberg said the camp will continue to move forward with its permit application.

But Lizberg said Camp Rainbow Gold was shocked and saddened by the neighborhood's response.

'After years of generous support in the Wood River Valley, we are disappointed at how this project is being perceived.' she said.

'Comments were made that are hurtful to the children and families we serve and the mission we fulfill.'
