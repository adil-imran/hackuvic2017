The New York Times has taken steps to secure the famed newspaper's leadership remains in the firm grasp of the family that has been running it for decades. Arthur Gregg Sulzberger, better known by A.G., has been named the deputy publisher of the Times, the newspaper formally announced Wednesday.

The move was hardly a surprise, as Sulzberger's father and current publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger had been grooming his son to ultimately take over what has become the family business. A.G., 36, has worked his way up from being a metro and national reporter to a metro editor to becoming more involved in newspaper's business handlings. He was named senior editor for strategy in July 2014.

“A.G. brings a compelling combination of journalistic experience, genuine strategic insight and a sense of urgency about the need for change and development in the company,” said Mark Thompson, the New York Times' chief executive officer.

Sulzberger Jr., who has been publisher of the newspaper for nearly 25 years, turned 65 last month, which the New York Post reported was a signal he was ready to step down from his post sooner rather than later.

"The task of choosing my successor has begun," he told New York Times employees almost a year ago, according to CNN Money. "This is a formal process involving the board of our company, senior management and the family trustees," he added. "It is our intention to be as transparent as we can as this unfolds."

Three finalists emerged in August 2015 for the position of deputy publisher, New York Magazine reported at the time. They are all cousins and members of the Sulzberger family: A.G.; Sam Dolnick, 35, an associate digital news editor; and David Perpich, 39, a senior vice president on the business side.

The news of A.G. Sulzberger's ascension was announced ahead of an anticipated report from Executive Editor Dean Baquet about plans for the newspaper's future, especially as it pertains to its digital and mobile endeavors. Dozens of its employees were offered buyout packages in May and the paper was preparing to lay off hundreds of others, the New York Post reported in April.
