Update@3:10 p.m. (Oct. 11):

Dwight E. Gehring, 67, of Englewood, has been sentenced to 13 years in prison for sexually assaulting a 5‐year‐old child in 2015, the Montgomery County prosecutor’s office announced in a press release Tuesday.

On May 10, 2015, Gehring was captured on a home security surveillance system sexually assaulting the child. At the time of the incident, Gehring was a licensed massage therapist.

Gehring was found guilty on Sept. 21 after pleading by Bill of Information to one count of rape by force, a first‐degree felony, and one count of gross sexual imposition of a child under the age of 13, a third‐degree felony. In addition to the 13 year prison sentence, Gehring was designated a Tier III sex offender for the rest of his life, and a Tier II sex offender

for 25 years after his release from prison, the release said.

First report:

Dwight Gehring, a former licensed message therapist accused of sexually assaulting a 5-year-old girl, is on his way to prison at least 13 years for admitting guilt Wednesday to felony charges of rape and gross sexual imposition involving a child.

The 67-year-old Englewood man, whose assault was captured on a “nanny cam,” pleaded guilty in Montgomery County Common Pleas Court.

We’ve learned, from information developed through his defense counsel, that the pleas came in exchange for a 13-year prison sentence with time served. Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 11.

Gehring remains in the county jail, where he has been since his arrest in May 2015 on charges accusing him of assaulting a 5-year-old girl.

He surrendered his medical license that same month and a county grand jury in June 2015 indicted him on one count of rape of a victim under age 10 and two counts of gross sexual imposition of a victim younger than 13 years old. At the time of his arraignment that same month, officials with the county prosecutor’s office suggested Gehring could get a life sentence if convicted as initially charged in the indictment.

According to online court records, Gehring was headed to trial Sept. 26 on five charges — two counts of gross sexual imposition of a child under 13, two counts of rape of a child under 10 and one count of rape by force or threat of force. The plea agreement was completed at a scheduling conference on Wednesday.
