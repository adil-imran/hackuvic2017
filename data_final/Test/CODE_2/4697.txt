Chinese technology firms are ready to share their wealth of experience in the information communication technology (ICT) with Nigeria to pull the country out of recession, the Consul-General in Lagos, Mr. Chao Xiaoliang, has said.

The envoy, who gave the assurance during the inauguration of the $6 million Huawei Customer Service Innovation Centre (CSIC) and the University of Lagos-Huawei JointLab in Lagos, at the weekend, said China was responding to the lull in global economy by restructuring its industries while Nigeria has chosen diversification as its strategy to fight the recession scourge.

He said: “I am quite confident that ICT will be a new and strong growth point among our future pragmatic cooperation. China is willing to share our experience in ICT and help boost the social and economic development of Nigeria.

“Against the backdrop of sluggish global economy, China is restructuring its industries while Nigeria is diversifying its economy. The highly complementary economies and development strategies of our two countries would ensure that our cooperation would achieve win-win results. The better Nigeria becomes, the better Chinese companies in Nigeria would be.

“I would like to congratulate Huawei on the successful commissioning of the Innovation and Experien2ce Centre. Chinese companies, such as Huawei, are willing to share their experience in ICT innovation in order to boost the social and economic development of Nigeria. I wish China and Nigeria a long-lasting relationship and prosperous future.”

Speaking on the occasion, Communications Technology Minister Adebayo Shittu said it was an epoch making event for a number of reasons, “but most importantly, the fact that the present government is easily the first government to come on stage leveraging the benefits of the digital revolution with strategic partnership with Huawei Chinese company as a leading global supplier of ICT products, solutions and services”.

He went on: “Therefore I would like to use this opportunity to express my appreciation on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria to Huawei Technologies for partnering the Ministry in the area of human and institutional capacity development.”

Huawei Technologies Company Nigeria Ltd., Managing Director, Mr. Frank Li, said the firm was dedicated to investment of industry innovation driven by both customer needs and new technologies. “Huawei will continuously adhere to its strategic focus, investment, and the relentless pursuit of strategic breakthrough to face all challenges together with its partners,” he added.

He said continuous investment and resources would be put into ICT innovation to drive the digital economy in Nigeria and other African countries.

Huawei Innovation and Experience Centre was built under the concept of cloud, which enables visitors to share Huawei global resources. It was set up to be an experience centre where people can witness global best practice, exchange ideas, explore business solutions through innovation and also a platform to develop win-win ICT ecosystem with latest cutting edge ICT technologies such as 4.5 G, Internet of Things (IoTs) and digital service innovation.
