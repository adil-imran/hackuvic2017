… Condemns attack on guber aspirant, Joe Agi

Cross River State APC governorship candidate in the 2015 general election, Mr. Odey Ochicha, on Tuesday advised Nigerian youths to take advantage of the current economic recession facing the country to embrace the opportunities that abound in Agriculture.

Ochicha, who spoke against the backdrop of recent crime wave across Nigeria, via a release in Calabar, noted that the best way out of the current economic crisis was for the youths to support efforts of the Federal Government to diversify the economy.

He said the quest of an average Nigerian graduate to secure a white collar job upon graduation from school has contributed negatively to the startling rate of unemployment in Nigeria.

The APC stalwart advised that at this critical point in Nigeria’s political history, every patriotic Nigerian should think of how they can help government rather than engage in the archaic politics of “Pull Him Down” syndrome.

“Nigeria is going through a stage that requires the support of everybody who means well for her by contributing in one way or the other to the strong will of the federal government to diversify our economy.”

“The youths, especially, have a critical role to play here. The culture of every graduate, even those who studied agriculture wanting to secure an office job won’t help us. Therefore, young people should take advantage of the opportunities the recession is presenting and embrace agriculture.

“The bible says every development is a blessing, this recession could just become and is actually a blessing in disguise for us” he said.

Ochicha, who was reluctant to speak on the ongoing legal battle between Governor Ben Ayade and Mr. Joe Agi, (SAN), however, condemned the recent activities of some Cross River youths, who displayed a coffin with the inscription “RIP Joe Agi”, during a solidarity match in support of the governor in Calabar.

Shortly after Ayade’s emergence as the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) flag bearer in its primary for the 2015 governorship election in Cross River State, Agi, his closest rival in the contest, faulted the governor’s election, alleging that he falsified his age and subsequently filed a lawsuit against him.

The final ruling on the lawsuit, which is currently before the Supreme Court, is slated for 9 December, 2016.

According to Ochicha, “There is nothing wrong in the people showing solidarity with their leader, but why take it to the extreme? There are certain things we do as leaders that the implication may hunt us down forever”, he added.
