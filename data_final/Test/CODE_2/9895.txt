His beloved chat show Chatty Man has reportedly been axed.

Yet Alan Carr refused to mope surrounding the reports after he scooped the role as guest editor-in-chief of Heat Magazine for this week's issue, where he divulged a hilarious anecdote.

The 40-year-old TV star claimed that following Kanye West's 2006 appearance on The Friday Night Project, the rapper, 39, invited Alan and his partner Paul Drayton to 'hang out' when they were on holiday in California.

Kanye's performance on the Channel 4 show was widely-discussed as he larked around with Alan and Justin Lee-Collins in an uncharacteristically light-hearted manner before later starring on Alan Carr Chatty Man in 2009.

In his collaboration with Heat, the hilarious comic has now revealed that he formed a bond with the rapper, who invited him to 'hang out' when Alan jetted to LA with his now-husband Paul.

Alan however took the invite as a joke and dismissed the suggestion, leaving him stunned when Kanye pursued their meeting.

He said: 'Oh my God, I love Kanye. He came on the chat show and my Paul said we’re going on holiday to California and Kanye said: "Let’s hang out".

Firm friends: The 40-year-old TV star claimed that following Kanye West's 2006 appearance on The Friday Night Project, the rapper, 39, invited Alan and his partner Paul Drayton to 'hang out' when they were on holiday in California

Uh oh! Alan however took the invite as a joke and dismissed the suggestion, leaving him stunned when Kanye pursued their meeting

'I thought it was like one of those: "Yeah, yeah, lets hang out” and then you turn up and their bodyguards Taser you. And then there we were at the airport on the way back and Kanye emailed Paul and said: “Hey are you guys in LA yet?”

'I was like: "S**t I didn’t know he was genuine!" I felt SO bad. I threw the phone (away from me) and told Paul to deal with it, because I’d go: "Yo, fo’shizzle". and all that and it would look like I was being stereotypical or racist at worst.'

Back in 2011, Alan once again discussed the meeting, as he gushed once more about the divisive rapper in an interview with The Sun: 'Kanye came on the Friday Night Project and was ever so sweet.

Pals: Atop his love of Kanye, he also divulged some truths about the rapper's wife Kim Kardashian, who appeared on Chatty Man in 2012: 'I love her, she has a great sense of humour and is beautiful. They both turned up with hardly any entourage, talked about anything and then she asked me to touch her bum'

Cheers! Of Kim's bum he said: 'I mean it was like being given a guided tour round StoneHenge or something, well, you have to say yes. So I touched it and it was like a Babybel or an Edam. It was very nice.'

'He invited me and Justin Lee Collins to go on his jet to see him perform in Oslo. But I was doing a charity night... I was very tempted to throw a sickie!'

Alan admits not every guest was as easygoing as the rapper as he discussed who was the biggest diva he has met: 'Mariah Carey was up there because she could only be filmed from the left side, which meant we would have to rotate the whole of The Friday Night Project studio!

'I just sort of went, ‘HAHAHAHA, what you like?!” when she said it. Then she asked for an ostrich feather to fan her down. This was in Regents Street, there was no Ostrich Feathers R Us!'
