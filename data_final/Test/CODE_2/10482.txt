One of the main trade unions in Dublin Bus has expressed caution about the prospect of planned talks this week successfully averting a series of bus strikes scheduled to take place in September.

Talks are to get underway on Friday afternoon in an attempt to head off six days of planned strikes next month at the State-owned bus company, as part of a dispute over pay.

Dublin Bus services in the capital are set to come to a halt on Thursday, September 8th, Friday 9th, Thursday 15th, Friday 16th, Friday 23rd and Saturday 24th, after unions at the company balloted for industrial action.

Last month, staff at the company rejected a Labour Court recommendation which proposed pay increases of about 8.2 per cent over three years.

Following the announcement of strike action, Dublin Bus management said it would arrange to meet with trade unions “to outline the company’s position, to discuss the issues in the dispute and to seek a way forward to avert industrial action”.

Minister for Transport Shane Ross had welcomed the planned talks between unions and management.

However, the National Bus and Rail Union (NBRU) - one of five staff representative organisations that have served strike notice on Dublin Bus - said on Wednesday it would “advise caution in relation to the possibility of a resolution to the Dublin Bus dispute” in the talks on Friday.

NBRU general secretary Dermot O’Leary said it was important that the Minister for Transport would “assist by using his good offices towards providing the necessary assistance to the company to enable it to address the legitimate pay claim made on behalf of all staff.

“Neither staff nor commuters will tolerate being treated to the spectacle of a Lannigan’s ball-type charade of the unions being asked to step in to be told that there is no more to offer and then having to step out again and trundle towards the inevitably of an unnecessary dispute.”

Resolution

Mr O’Leary said the NBRU would attend the talks on Friday “in resolution mode.

“We have already demonstrated, along with trade union colleagues, that we are prepared to build our way towards realising the ambitions of our members on a step-by-step basis.

“The first building block in the process is the requirement for the company to recognise and address the challenge thrown down by the rejection of the Labour Court recommendation.

“However, both parties’ ability to come back to the table unfettered is fundamental in achieving a resolution to this dispute.”

Unions at Dublin Bus are seeking a 15 per cent pay rise over a three-year period, as well as the payment of an award of six per cent dating back to 2008.

The NBRU is also seeking pay parity for drivers at Dublin Bus with drivers on the Luas light rail system.

Luas drivers secured pay increases of about 18 per cent over four years as part of a settlement reached in June following a lengthy dispute at the Dublin tram service.
