When PM Narendra Modi raised the issue of Balochistan in his 15th August speech, he was praised all over Agra for taking a firm stand against Pakistan's oppression of the Dalits, but until last week, there was a very small percentage of Agra residents, who were aware of the fact that there are hundreds of ethnic Balochs living right in the heart of Agra, in a locality aptly named "Billochpura".

"AGRA BALOCH COMMUNITY WILL SUPPORT THE MOVEMENT"

However, this fact became known to all, when Mazdak Dilshad Khan, the leader of Free Balochistan movement contacted this minority community for support and Razak Khan, the leader of local Baloch community came forward and assured that the Agra Baloch community will support the movement within the framework of Indian law.

Talking to India Today, Razak Khan said that he will soon lead a delegation of local Balochs to areas of western UP that have ethnic Balochs living there, including Bagpat in Haryana among other cities. He said that they were waiting for the festival of Eid-ul-Adha to get over before making their move.

"MODI FOLLOWING POLICY OF QUID-PRO-QUO"

Social activist Vishal Sharma said that although some may term Modi's mention of Balochistan as interference in Pakistan's internal affairs, in fact, Modi was following a policy of "quid-pro-quo" with Pakistan by mentioning Balochistan in reply of Pakistan's mention of Kashmir. He said that there were two Billochpuras in Agra, one near the Taj Mahal and one closer to Agra Mental Asylum. In fact, he said, the Mental Asylum itself was often known by the name Billochpura, which is an etymological derivative of "Balochpura".

He said that although it was quite heartwarming to see scenes from Balochistan where Baloch leaders were praising India and shouting "Bharat mata ki jai", but if the local Baloch leaders are willing to support the separatist movement in Balochistan, they should be aware of the fact that India officially frowns upon groups causing unrest in other countries, which includes Pakistan and its occupied territories.

He said that opposition parties who are criticising Modi for mentioning Balochistan and blaming him for sparking in that Pakistan-occupied territory should also have the guts to criticise the separatist leaders living in India who openly voice pro-Pakistan statements.

Sharma said that this new turn in Modi's diplomacy towards Pakistan will have far-reaching results and could deal India a better hand in the global power game.
