Growing influence of outsiders on party and family

LUCKNOW: During a recent meeting of members of Uttar Pradesh 's ruling Yadav family in Lucknow to resolve the escalating family feud, one issue dominated the proceedings, but without consensus: the growing influence of "outsiders".Insiders say UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav was at pains to convince the elders — his father, SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav; and his uncle, senior minister Shivpal Yadav — about the "evil" influence of these "outsiders" on the party.However, when he found his arguments had not cut much ice and the elders remained resolute on the issue, Akhilesh reportedly said he would quit "everything" and offered to limit himself to just campaigning. Those privy to the details of the meeting, held at Mulayam's official residence on Vikramaditya Marg here, told TOI the "outsiders" issue was discussed at length and Akhilesh tried his best to convince his father and uncle that this was the root of the ongoing tussle.When Mulayam and Shivpal reportedly tried to argue about the practical "utility" of these people, Akhilesh went to the extent of saying that "they first create a crisis and then present themselves as saviours". The meeting ended abruptly, without any long-term solution to the intra-family feud, making Akhilesh even more determined to stand for his view-points.He also argued that had these outsiders not been interfering, all family issues would have been resolved as they had been in the past. However, his argument found no takers and the stalemate, which is jeopardising the party's election campaign, continues."The internal situation is fluid and may take any shape. It's for this reason that the election campaign plan has been frozen for now," remarked a senior minister. In an interview to TOI on Thursday, even Akhilesh had admitted the campaign was already late by a month and that there was no green signal yet from the party. On Friday, Mulayam, too, talked about the SP's jubilee celebrations, but there were no clear words about the poll campaign.Political analysts feel a lack of communication among Yadav family members is aggravating the situation. "Many a time deadlocks are broken within the family through informal interactions. But here even formal communication is not happening," said an analyst.Another key member of the family, Mulayam's cousin Ram Gopal Yadav, has been completely marginalised after expressing open opposition to Mulayam's decision to install Shivpal as the state chief in place of Akhilesh. Ram Gopal was the first to opine, in 2012, that Akhilesh should be made CM and continues to be on his side. On Friday, Mulayam openly pronounced that "Shivpal hi sab kuchh hain, vahi karta dharta hain (Now Shivpal controls everything. He is the one in charge of party affairs)All eyes are set on the CM's next move, particularly after his recent comment that the one who holds the maximum trump cards wins the hand. Those close to him told TOI that the recent turn of events has saddened him and that he had felt humiliated on several occasions. Last month, after a truce was forged, he lost the post of state chief of the party and young leaders loyal to him were sacked.A month on, despite his public appeal for their reinstatement, the party is yet to act on this issue. On the contrary, his decisions were reversed one after the other. Gayatri Prajapati, sacked by him on corruption charges from the Cabinet , has been reinstated and Shivpal openly announced the merger of Qaumi Ekta Dal (QED) with SP. Akhilesh had vehemently opposed — and stalled — the merger as long as he was the state chief.There are several other issues, say people close to Akhilesh, which have bogged him down. According to reliable sources, the CM is under tremendous pressure to transfer the Rs 10,000-crore Agra theme park — allotted to Bollywood actor-director Sanjay Khan — to a BJP-supported businessman and also expedite the tender for the Rs 4,000-crore high-security number plate project in the state.Similarly, he is also reportedly under pressure to allot the Rs 15,000-crore Poorvanchal Expressway. He was also reportedly not in favour of appointing Bollywood actor Jaya Prada to the post of UP Film Development Corporation vice-chairperson but was pressured to do so. Besides, sources say, he is also warding off intense lobbying to reinstate Deepak Singhal as chief secretary.Last month, when he was removed from the post of state SP chief, there was a groundswell of support for him from the party's youth brigade who took to the streets in Lucknow and marched to the residence of the party supremo, which is unprecedented. However, Akhilesh showed laudable restraint and reined in his supporters. "Non-violent struggle is what I learnt from Lohia ," he told TOI on Wednesday.However, there has to be a limit to this tolerance, say his supporters. Realising that he has a long way to go, he is preparing for the next elections without crossing the "Laxman Rekha" of restraint. He has actively taken part in the opening of the new office of the Janeshwar Mishra Trust which has given his young supporters shelter. And even if he is not whole-heartedly backed by party seniors, he is ready to hit the roads on his own.FLASHPOINTS
