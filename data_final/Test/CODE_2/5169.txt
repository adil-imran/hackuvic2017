America’s Asia Pivot: US THAAD to target Russia, China!

-Dr. Abdul Ruff

_____

America is the most formidable military state with multi arsenals of terror goods in store, including WMD, wanting to sell or use them in war in alien territories. Entire world has supported US plan to conquer the globe by allowing the Pentagon-CIA duo to commission military bases in many strategically important nations. Many third world nations, like India offer their own airbases to the Pentagon for exclusive military purposes.

Washington tries all possible permutations to make Russia and China pro-US proxy states to pursue exclusive NATO agenda while China outrightly ignores all such coercive efforts, Russia counter plays them, causing obstacles to US resolve to control the world single handedly.

For instance, the Putin government sees Syria as part of a broader struggle against the US drive to militarily encircle Russia. Targeting Russia-China duo is the top agenda of USA. Neocons and US regime in general are not entirely happy about emerging Russo-China equations and their increasing military ties. US President Obama’s Asia pivot agenda is taking a more advanced level now with the plan to deploy US THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system) to target Russia and China and now it is clear by Asia pivot Washington means both Russia ad China. Earlier Obama signaled USA is only trying to weaken China alone and had no plan to antagonize Russia. But now Syrian conflict has led to bilateral crisis too.

The planned deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile system to the Korean Peninsula is part of US policy to provoke a war against Russia and China. It is extremely dangerous as part of the overall policy of the Obama govt to encircle Russia and China with the most advanced anti-ballistic missile systems which they openly declare are intended to be able to take out a counter strike force from Russia or from China. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang, however, urged Washington to cancel the imminent deployment, stressing that militarization of the Korean Peninsula could “seriously harm the strategic interests of China.”

Back in July, the USA and South Korea said they had made a final decision to deploy the THAAD missile system in the South, claiming it will only be used in defense against what they called North Korean threats. The decision came after Pyongyang conducted its fourth nuclear test in January, which was followed by a satellite launch and a string of test-launches of various missiles.

As pressure had been mounting from Russia, China and other nations on USA to dismantle the dangerous western military alliance NATO, USA moved ahead with a well planned strategy of creating the threat perceptions to retain NATO. This could on one major cause for the USA and imperialist allies to plan the Sept-11 which was executed in perfection by employing CIA agents including high profile Osama in the world’s most advanced country, has worked miracle for the USA, Europe and all their anti-Islamic nations to advance their global anti-Islam agenda more vigorously. The attacks helped USA and its NATO to invade and occupy and destabilize many Muslim nations, loot or destroy their energy resources. Syria may not be America’s last Muslim nation to be destabilized and thousands of Muslims killed as per the Neocon strategy.

Washington is intervening in Syria not to fight ”terrorism” or champion human rights, but to further its longstanding drive to assert unchallengeable US hegemony over the Middle East and its vast energy resources, and to deny access to both Russia and China. It is prepared to prolong the bloodshed as long as necessary to bring about regime change and prevent Russia from consolidating a government under current President Bashar al-Assad, or a successor that is amendable to Russian interests.

Russia

Domestic exploitation and colonialist looting plus genocides had been the order of the old world controlled by capitalist nations led by USA and Great Britain. Rocky opposition Soviet Russia offered to US unilateralism and militarism for decades forced the enemies of humanity to revise their exploitative imperialist and colonialist programs to enslave the third world nations. Exit of Soviet system has emboldened US led colonialist nations to resume invasion process to cripple the third world nations.

New world that emerged after the end of Cold War, has witnessed a new kind of international coalition of USA and Russia confusing and threatening third world nations.

One would feel shaky that the confrontational systems have merged to some extend leading to a confrontational cum cooperative attitude of both USA and Russia, fighting to dominate the world affairs, keeps the terror war and world alive with their regular conflictual rhetoric and interferences in the affairs of other countries. But that is not a healthy tendency as it threatens and wrecks the weak nations that do not fully obey Washington.

While USA does everything only advance its global interests, Russia fights against USA but only for itself.

Russia entered Syria, began attacking Syrians and others in Syria. Besides domination in the region, Moscow is eager to upset US plans in the region and for Russia.

Russia is beefing up Russian air defense systems inside Syria, deploying an advanced S-300 surface-to-air missile battery to protect the Russian naval base in the Syrian port city of Tartus.

Friction between Ankara and Washington has mounted in relation to the US use of Syrian Kurdish separatist militias as their main proxy force in northern Syria. Turkey is determined to drive back the Kurdish forces and prevent them from consolidating an autonomous territory on Turkey’s border.

Russian President Putin is scheduled to meet with his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in Turkey on October 10, the first such visit since Turkish military shot down a Russian jet on the Turkish-Syrian border in November 2015, presumably on instruction from the Pentagon and NATO.

Putin is said to guard the system that covers up the crimes (like journalist Anna Politkovskaya in 2006 or opposition leader Boris Nemtsov in 2015)—a system so corrupt that it would be very hard to decide where to let the truth emerge without having everything unravel

Permanent war advantages

USA is on war mode because that helps it control the world and its resources, militaries, intelligences, polices and media. After 15 years of waging aggressive war in the Middle East at the cost of millions of human deaths and the destabilization and destruction of entire Muslim societies as the target for ‘collective punishment” for the 2001 Sept-11 hoax in USA, , Washington is the last one to deliver lectures on “war crimes.” UN officials estimate that as many as a million people may be driven from their homes in a US-backed Iraqi offensive, expected as early as next month, against the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, which is under the control of the Islamic State. Washington’s NATO ally in the region, Turkey, has issued public warnings about the upcoming Mosul offensive. Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim described US plans as “dangerous”

The breakdown of the Syrian ceasefire talks and the menacing military escalations by both sides are the product not merely of individual truce violations. On the US side, these were egregious, with the US-backed militias carrying out hundreds of attacks. Even more decisive was the September 17 US bombing of a Syrian government outpost near the town of Deir ez-Zor, killing and wounding nearly 200 troops. It served to blow up the ceasefire deal and prevent the implementation of a joint targeting and intelligence-sharing agreement with Russia that the US military command openly opposed.

USA takes care that Russia does not take any credit to end the war in Syria or anywhere in Arab world. So, USA is keen to escalate the war ignoring international law, though Obama pretends to be innocent, as usual a good boy, But in order to placate White House concerns over launching such direct military attacks against another country without authorization from the United Nations Security Council, it has been proposed that the strikes be carried out “covertly and without public acknowledgment. Both the CIA and the Pentagon bosses have already “expressed support for such ‘kinetic’ options because the fall of Aleppo would undermine America’s counterterrorism goals in Syria. This is of course a propaganda pretext for the launching of another direct US military intervention in the Middle East.

USA wants to escalate war in Arab world and hence opposes Russian proposals for ending the Syrian war. The Obama government reportedly considers escalating US military intervention in Syria In the wake of breaking off bilateral talks with Moscow on efforts to achieve a genuine truce and political settlement in the war-ravaged Arab country,. The classified military proposals include bombing Syrian air force runways using cruise missiles and other long-range weapons fired from coalition planes and ships, as well as other acts of military aggression. President Barack Obama may likely reject the proposal for military action, the combined pressure of the CIA and the military command may well force a shift in policy

The US military and intelligence apparatus seems fears is that the Russian-backed Syrian government offensive to overrun eastern Aleppo will deprive the so-called “rebels,” who have been armed, funded and directly paid by the CIA and US regional allies—Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Aleppo is their last stronghold in western Syria’s major population centers. This would spell a crushing reversal for the five-year-old war for regime change orchestrated by Washington. The claim that this would “undermine America’s counterterrorism goals” only underscores the fraud of the US war on terror.

Some countries like India have learned from experience that by antagonizing the formidable USA they could only invite troubles even from their neighbors, allies and friendly nations. India made “friends” with USA without straining historic ties with Russia as Russia remains India’s major arms exporter. India pumps out plenty of hard earned resources to USA in order to make USA in good humors and themselves to be its “good books” so that it could continue to occupy Jammu Kashmir and kill Muslims there. For USA the Kashmir issue concerning the life of Muslims, in fact does not concern and it has made India a profitable ally temporarily. India is terribly happy about new love of Americans towards them because it could play the “new energy” against Pakistan fairly easily. USA has no reason to be genuinely an ally with a nation is very close to Moscow- the chief target of NATO.

The “rogue” elements

USA seeks to make nuclear war feasible. US Defense Secretary who has openly called for a complete modernization of the entire nuclear stockpile in the USA just over the last few days and of course is the person pushing for the THAAD deployment in South Korea, for the deployment of anti-ballistic missiles in Hungary and Romania and on the Russian border in Europe.

Not wanting any kind of opposition to its continued domination worldwide in all respects and domains, USA argues that the end of Soviet communism has not made the world safe as there are still other “rogue” elements existing and emerging “fresh” in the world. Obviously Islam is the important enemy of west and capitalism although many Muslim nations have adopted capitalism a profitable aspect of their “faith”. Apart from Islam, Russia, China and their allies are the target of USA and its imperialist allies.

Meanwhile, Iran warns USA against targeting Syria army. A senior Iranian official and veteran diplomat has warned the United States against direct military intervention against the Syrian army, saying that would amount to “suicide” for the American forces. The Syrian nation, backed by Russia, can fight back potential American aggression.

So far, the USA has been supporting, with the provision of military hardware and likely intelligence sharing, the “moderate” militants fighting the Syrian government. Despite a recent case in which the USA directly targeted Syrian soldiers, which it said happened by mistake; Washington has refrained from direct military involvement in the Arab country.

President Barack Obama has previously portrayed involvement in another Middle East war as harmful to US interests. His reluctance to invade Syria, despite numerous past threats, has angered a number of Arab dictatorships opposed to President Assad. Recently, however, militant sources claimed the USA was resolved to prevent the fall of the Syrian city of Aleppo, a bastion of anti-Damascus militants that is the target of an ongoing Syrian and Russian campaign for liberation.

The US State Department also recently warned that it would be considering the suspension of “bilateral engagement” with Russia in Syria unless Moscow took “immediate steps to end the assault on Aleppo.”

Russia is more estranged from Europe and the USA than at any point since the end of the Cold War, and perhaps much longer ago than that. The president of Russia is simply a poor judge of the country’s interests.

The problem of unquestioning acceptance of information circulated by intelligence services—exists everywhere, but it seems especially acute in the Russian system where communist ideology has overpowering impact on the media. USA says this aspect makes defaming the USA and doubting its actions all too easy.

White House and Pentagon have no answer to genocides of millions of Muslims in its illegal war in Islamic world.



Observation

US worry is childish, to say the least, that Moscow would further strengthen its military deals with regional governments by selling weapon systems to defend against Israeli aggression if any.

The Kremlin fears that a successful US regime-change operation in Syria would serve as a stepping stone toward direct intervention in Russia, including through the unleashing of CIA-funded Islamist fighters drawn from Russia’s Caucasus region. Russian strategists argue that a US-backed client regime in Damascus could help funnel separatist forces, already trained on the Syrian battlefield, back into Russia to serve as Western proxies in a campaign to destabilize and ultimately dismember the Russian Federation.

It is almost six years that the people of Syria have been resisting interference by foreigners, especially the Westerners, with the USA at the top with a permanent war agenda. The Syrian nation has the capability to withstand US military intervention, and the Americans will not do that launch aggression.

Thus USA has not directly involved in Syrian war and it only arms and promotes the opposition rebels. Recently, there has been talk of a scenario in which the USA would directly target the Syrian Arab Army, which is the army of the Syrian Arab Republic. A US led foreign-backed militancy has been going on in Syria since March 2011, with a plethora of armed groups — each supported by one foreign country or another — fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad.

USA thinks Russia and China are still considering a new world order to check US imperialism. If the USA is panicked about the fact that a new paradigm based on humanity and progress has been put in place and they are willing to go to war to stop it and that is what is behind the THAAD missile as part of that policy. It is quite likely that pushed by the Neocons who recommend client states to serve the US causes globally, the USA might be willing to go to war first with China and then with Russia in order to stop the emerging new world economic order that is a “severe threat” to the British-American banking system which indeed is in a state of general collapse.

However, White House is weary about a new war that too against Russo-China, wasting more resources and losing solders. The USA has suffered a defeat in military campaigns both in Afghanistan and Iraq and a third adventure, in Syria, would hand Washington its third defeat — a more stinging one. Russia is eager USA loses war and Mideast is free of wars. If the Americans take military action in Syria, it will be a suicidal action; and their third military defeat in the region after Afghanistan and Iraq will be a stronger defeat.

USA stands fully exposed as coup maker in Turkey and more and more Turks hate USA. Turkey’s tensions with Washington and pursuit of its own regional (Kurdish) ambitions in Syria only serve to heighten the geopolitical tensions that could turn the Syrian war for regime change into a new world war. USA is concerned about hat.

It is well-known that the deployment of the US advanced missile system is just a check post against Russia as is “useless” against the North Korean provocation, so both the THAAD missile and the radar systems are aimed at encircling China and the Russian Far East. THAAD has been designed by USA to intercept ballistic missiles inside or just outside the atmosphere during their final phase of flight.

US actions do bring Russia and China together and stronger.
