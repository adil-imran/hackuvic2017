Macdonald Hotels gets serious about food

HOTEL group Macdonald Hotels has reinforced its commitment to premium dining by appointing a food and beverage director.

Andy Lowe arrives at the privately-owned chain with more than 30 years’ experience in the hospitality sector.

His remit is to work with the Macdonald Hotels board and chefs to create and deliver a food and drink strategy.

Originally from Sutton Coldfield Andy has worked at board level in the hotel and hospitality industry for a decade with GLH Hotels, David Lloyd Leisure, and Spirit Pubs among others. The running enthusiast has also worked in some of the world’s top kitchens from as far away as Bermuda, New Zealand and Australia.

Mr Lowe said: “The Macdonald Hotels Group’s dedicated ethos to delivering a quality food and beverage provision across its entire portfolio and their commitment to sourcing the finest and freshest local ingredients is what really attracted me to the role.”

Simon Jackson group sales director, and chief executive at Macdonald Resorts, said: “It’s another great addition to the Macdonald team to have someone with the depth of Andy’s experience now on board.

“Andy’s vision for where he wants to take the food and beverage side of our business is exactly the direction we want to be travelling.

Andy’s appointment comes soon after the announcement of Michelin starred chef Tony Borthwick joining the Macdonald Rusacks Hotel in St. Andrews as the executive head chef.

Border Biscuits eyes innovation

BISCUIT manufacturer Border is hoping to bring further new products to the market following the appointment of Victoria Lee as new product development (NPD) manager.

Ms Lee joins the Lanark-based business from Paterson Arran, where she was responsible for leading strategic NPD projects to drive growth for food service and retail channels.

She comes to the business with experience of developing a number of new products for the likes of Finsbury Food Group, Weightwatchers and New Primebake and will lead the development of new recipes for the family-owned firm.

Commenting on her appointment, Ms Lee said she was looking forward to bringing “new and exciting recipes” to the market.

“I am keen to apply my knowledge and experience at Border as it is a business that cares about the consumer, its employees and the world around it,” she said. “Border only uses the finest ingredients and this gives me a great platform to use during this exciting time in the company’s history.”

Lesley Ann Gray, brand and innovation director, added: “Victoria is a talented and creative individual who will play a key role in creating distinctive products that our consumers will love.”

Doctors in the house at Morton Fraser

LAW firm Morton Fraser has become the only practice in Scotland to have two intellectual property lawyers with doctoral degrees after the appointment of Julie Nixon as a senior solicitor in its corporate team.

She joins Peter Galloway as Morton Fraser’s second IP specialist with a scientific background. Ms Nixon holds a PhD in molecular biology and genetics from the University of Edinburgh while Mr Galloway has a PhD in physics from Oxford.

Ms Nixon’s appointment comes as demand for Morton Fraser’s IP advice from the life sciences and engineering sectors continues to increase.

She will be responsible for advising clients on IP and commercial contracts, including IP protection and commercialisation, e-commerce and IT agreements, as well as on corporate matters.

Austin Flynn, Partner and head of Morton Fraser’s corporate division said: “Attracting someone with Julie’s scientific expertise and experience is a huge boost to our corporate team. Having two IP lawyers with scientific backgrounds gives us the ability to offer clients a unique and multifaceted service.”

Morton Fraser’s corporate division has also been strengthened by the recent appointment of Callum Murray as a senior associate.
