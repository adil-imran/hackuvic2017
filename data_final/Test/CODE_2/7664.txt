DAMASCUS, Oct. 11 (Xinhua) -- At least 12 people were allegedly killed in airstrikes on Tuesday in Syria's northern city of Aleppo, a monitor group reported.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that 12 people were killed by intense Russian airstrikes on rebel-held areas on Tuesday. The report cannot be independently verified.

Four children were among those killed in the airstrikes, which targeted the neighborhoods of Fardous, Bustan al-Qaser and other areas in the rebel-held eastern part of Aleppo, said the report.

The UK-based watchdog group said the death toll could likely rise due to the high number of critically wounded people, and those still under the rubble.

The Observatory, which relies on a network of activists on ground, said the airstrikes are the most intense following a relative lull that lasted for a few days in eastern Aleppo.

The escalation on Tuesday comes a day after the Syrian Foreign Ministry resent another invitation to the Syrians in rebel-held areas to leave, promising them secure passages into government-controlled areas, and safe accommodation.

The invitation is the latest in a series of calls by the Syrian government on the civilians to leave the rebel-held areas, and for the rebels to lay down their weapons.

On Sept. 22, the Syrian army declared a new offensive aiming to dislodge the rebels from the eastern part of Aleppo city, triggering a series of accusations from the Western countries, who charged that Russia and the Syrian army are committing war crimes in Aleppo.

On Tuesday, the head of the Observatory, Rami Abdul-Rahman, said the people in the eastern part of Aleppo "doesn't trust" the Syrian authorities, as they fear to face imprisonment and integration.

He said instead of having the civilians leave eastern Aleppo, the government-imposed siege on such areas must come to an end in order for the relief aid to enter those areas.

Aleppo, located near the borders with Turkey, is Syria's largest city and once an economic hub. It has been a focal point of clashes between the Syrian army and the rebels.

The rebels laid siege to western Aleppo districts after cutting the international road to Aleppo in 2014, a siege broken later by the Syrian army with the help of Hezbollah.
