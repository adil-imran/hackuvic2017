The Council of State is an advisory body. Its membership include serving and former Presidents of Nigeria, former and serving Chief Justices, serving Senate President and Speaker of the House of Representatives and 36 state governors.

Speaking to State House Correspondents after the Council’s meeting, Jigawa State governor, Abubakar Badaru alongside his Lagos State counterpart, Akinwumni Ambode disclosed that the decision to confirm IGP Idris, who has been in acting capacity, was unanimous.

Badaru said, “we deliberated on the confirmation of the Inspector General of Police (IGP). There was almost unanimous acceptance of his confirmation. So, the Police Council do resolve to confirm the Acting Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris.

“Most of the comments received proved to us that the IGP is of impeccable character and we expect him to conduct himself as such. We believe he is very honest and transparent. We also believe he will continue to be honest and do his best for the country,” Badaru said.

The governor noted that beyond the Police Council’s resolution, the IGP has to be presented to the Senate, specifically for confirmation.

On his part, Governor Ambode said that the Council deliberated on the appointment of six national commissioners for INEC.

“You know INEC is supposed to have 12. We had earlier approved 6 sometime last year and additional six were actually approved today. And those six represent six nominees from the six geo-political zones.

“You may wish to know that we approved five new commissioners for the National Population Commission (NPC) in addition to what was actually approved for INEC,” Ambode said.

He listed the names of the INEC commissioners as Mohammed Haruna (North Central); AVM Ahmed Tijjani Mu’azu rtd (North East); Abubakar Nahuce (North West); Professor Okechukwu Ibanu (South East); May Agbamuche Mbu (South South); and Dr. Adekunle Ladipo Ogumola (South West).

While the new commissioners for NPC are Dr Eyitayo Oyetunji (Oyo); Barr. Patricia Iyaya (Benue); Egr. Benedict Ukpong (Akwa Ibom); Dr. Halu Bala (Kebbi); and Gloria Isofo (Bayelsa).

On the economic recession, Ambode said: “the council was also briefed on the state of the economy. The Minister of State from the Ministry of Budget and Planning actually made a presentation to council on the ways and manner in which the federal government is approaching the way to rescue the recession path that we are going through.

“Council was confident and also approved the measures the federal government is putting in ensuring that Nigeria goes on the path of recovery as quickly as possible,” he said.

Baduru further pointed out that: “Majorly, there is a very good focus on the diversification of the economy. Serious focus on agriculture and solid mineral development as well.”
