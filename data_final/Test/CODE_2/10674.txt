The following factors are likely to influence Malaysian palm oil futures and other vegetable oil

markets.

FUNDAMENTALS

* Malaysian palm oil futures declined for a second straight session on Monday evening, weighed

down by higher September end-stocks and on a technical correction.

* U.S. wheat futures rose more than 2 percent on Monday on short-covering and spillover strength

from the crude oil market, analysts said.

* Oil prices jumped as much as 3 percent on Monday, with Brent hitting a one-year high, after

Russia said it was ready to join OPEC in curbing crude output and Algeria called for similar

commitments from other non-OPEC producers.

MARKET NEWS

* U.S. stocks strode higher on Monday, lifted by Hillary Clinton's widening lead in the U.S.

presidential campaign and by a surge in oil prices, while sterling was under pressure on

concerns Britain will make a hard exit from the European Union.
