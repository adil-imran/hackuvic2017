SARA-data is a clinical data platform designed to integrate data from the SARA clinical trials, beginning with the SARA-OBS study, from all sources and in real time. Key elements of SARA-data include:

Electronic Case Report Form (e-CRF) and electronic Patient-Reported Outcomes (e-PRO), that will be used for more reliable and cheaper data management compared to standard paper- based clinical questionnaires;

The opportunity for senior patients to utilize a web-based portal to complete standardized e- PROs remotely at home;

Storage of bio-imaging source data and bioanalytical results, including biomarkers, for secondary research;

Spontaneous physical activity will be recorded on a continuous basis via a connected accelerometer.

Biophytis selected Bluecompanion and eClinicalHealth, two innovative European e-health-focused firms, as partners for the design and implementation of SARA-data.

Following successful completion of SARA-OBS, SARA-data will also be utilized in the Phase 2b SARA-INT clinical trial, providing a comprehensive system for assessing the effectiveness of Sarconeos.

Stanislas Veillet, CEO of BIOPHYTIS, declares: "We look forward to leveraging our proprietary e-Health platform, SARA-data, to more accurately track physical activity and analyse other clinical outcomes in sarcopenia patients. I am confident that the use of SARA-data will add significant value to the quality of the clinical data we will generate. Our use of SARA-data represents the exciting convergence of biotechnology and e-Health technology that can make the difference in better understanding sarcopenia in aging patients and better evaluating the effectiveness of Sarconeos."

He adds: "With Bluecompanion, we have designed SARA-data in order to capture, integrate and make available on the same digital platform different source data: patients' questionnaires, physical activity sensoring and recording, and DXA imaging, combined to standard clinical data reporting."

Karl Landert, CEO of eClinicalHealth, comments: "We are pleased to be selected as the Biophytis technology partner to support the implementation of SARA-data. Through the use of Clinpal, we can work collaboratively with Biophytis and Blue Companion to move important innovative research efforts forward in sarcopenia patients."

About SARCONEOS

Sarconeos is a first in class drug candidate based on the activation of the MAS receptor (major player of the renin-angiotensin system) restoring muscular anabolism, inhibiting myostatin, that has demonstrated meaningful activity in animal models of muscular dystrophies. Sarconeos is developed in the treatment of sarcopenia, an age-related degeneration of skeletal muscle, leading to loss of mobility in elderly people. This condition, for which no medical treatment currently exists, was first described in 1993 and has entered the International Classification of Diseases (M62.84) in 2016. It affects more than 50 million people worldwide.
