GETTY A single mother will be spared jail because she was domestically abused in the past

A judge told Zena Bromley that an abusive relationship in her past enabled him to put her attack “into context”. He said it explained why she 'reacted and acted' in the way she did when she lashed out at Shane McKenna at a bar in Rochester, Kent.

Maidstone Crown Court heard yesterday that Zena Bromley, 26, accused Mr McKenna of owing her £90 when she saw him on a night out. She had previously dated a friend of his but Mr McKenna had not seen her for about six months. Prosecutor Bridget Todd said he refused her “persistent and relentless” demands and tried to walk away. At one stage he even asked a bouncer to intervene.

But Bromley then struck Mr McKenna four or five times in the face, with both her hands, causing bruising, cuts and a swollen cheekbone. She later admitted assault causing actual bodily harm, having told police she believed that Mr McKenna was going to assault her first. Imposing a six-month community order, Judge Philip St John-Stevens referred to a “previous abusive relationship” which was “of significance” in explaining her behaviour that evening in September 2014.

“Clearly you have in your life been subjected to situations which perhaps you have witnessed which led you to react in a way that is wholly out of character,” he said. “It places into context why a mother of 26 years of age, with a young child, who has worked hard, perhaps reacted and acted in the way you did and that provides strong mitigation because it places it into context.” The judge added that he had also taken into account her immediate admission of guilt when arrested, the depression she suffers from and the delay in the case coming to court. Mr McKenna was awarded £150 compensation but Bromley, from Rochester, Kent, was given a year to pay.
