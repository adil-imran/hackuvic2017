British troops will return to Jordan and Turkey to train moderate Syrian forces to fight Islamic State.

A similar programme to ready 5,000 fighters for battle ended in farce last year when the ‘moderates’ were either kidnapped or joined extremist organisations and UK forces pulled out.

But in a U-turn yesterday, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon announced 20 soldiers will return to the region to start the training again.

Under the new plans, recruits will be subject to ‘strict vetting procedures’ in an attempt to stop them slipping through the net and working against Western forces.

Speaking ahead of a ministerial meeting today in Paris to discuss IS, also known as Daesh, Mr Fallon said: ‘Daesh are on the back foot. The RAF is already playing a leading role in the air, hitting them hard in Iraq and Syria.

‘Now we’re stepping up our support to moderate opposition forces in Syria, through training them in the skills they need to defeat Daesh.’

Last year Britain sent around 100 soldiers to Turkey and Jordan to take part in the US-led training programme.

But only around 100 moderates were thought to have undergone training because of problems finding Syrian recruits untainted by extremist affiliations.

The first trained batch of about 50 were kidnapped by Al Qaeda and the second group of around 30 ‘betrayed the US’ and defected with their weapons to another jihadi group, Jabhat al-Nusra.

The British soldiers returned home in an admission the plan had failed. Yesterday a Whitehall source said: ‘Syria is a basket case and we need to try to do something.’

UK personnel will train the moderate Syrian opposition fighters on basic infantry tactics, and medical and explosive hazard awareness skills. The Ministry of Defence said in a statement: ‘As the campaign against Daesh terrorists reaches a crucial stage, following the advance on Mosul in Iraq, UK troops will help improve the capabilities of vetted members of the moderate Syrian opposition, and to generate greater numbers of trained moderate Syrian opposition fighters to contribute to the counter Daesh campaign.’

The announcement follows a US request to the UK to support the training programme, which restarted in July.

Last year David Cameron faced criticism after he said 70,000 moderate Syrian ground troops would help the UK and the coalition in its fight against IS.

The UN refugee agency has said it will set up 30,000 tents within days to shelter an estimated 150,000 Iraqis fleeing battles around the IS stronghold of Mosul (pictured)

Tory sceptics suggested it was delusional to claim there were tens of thousands of moderates willing to kill the jihadists.

Meanwhile, the UN refugee agency has said it will set up 30,000 tents within days to shelter an estimated 150,000 Iraqis fleeing battles around the IS stronghold of Mosul.

UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi insisted: ‘The preparations are proceeding well.’ Iraqi forces backed by a US-led coalition last week launched an offensive to push IS from its last stronghold in the country.

As fighting nears the city, up to a million people could be displaced, sparking an unprecedented humanitarian emergency. UNHCR says more than three million people have already been forced from their homes since the start of 2014, including a third in its Kurdish region.
