“It is obvious that too much has been cut when it comes to health care,” Renzi said on September 27 | Andreas Solaro/AFP via Getty Images Special Report: EU Health Care Troubled Italian health system frustrates doctors, drugmakers Promises to hike spending haven’t materialized, and politics may keep things that way.

ROME — Italy’s health system is hemorrhaging cash.

Doctors feel underpaid and overworked, and drugmakers are threatening to bolt if more funds are not devoted to pricey innovative drugs.

The rising drug prices, limited adoption of cheaper generics and a rapidly aging population are among the factors that led to 18 of 20 Italian regions spending more than budgeted on health care in the first six months of this year. In 2013, 15 regions were in the red.

Italy’s struggles to keep its population healthy with new treatments and care while balancing its books embody the challenges facing much of the rest of Europe.

But the country’s broader financial crisis has hit the health sector in some ways more than its peers: While health spending in rich countries recovered after the financial crisis, it has contracted in Italy for several years, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.

“The current situation is not sustainable. We need a new model to govern pharmaceutical expenditure,” said Paolo Bonaretti, the Italian Ministry of Economic Development’s adviser for drug policies. “We need a revolution.”

Now, a three-year health spending pact is expiring, and drugmakers say that without a boost, they’ll move their research and development investments out of the country.

“The government needs to acknowledge what a pivotal role we play for Italy, or drugmakers will move somewhere else,” said Massimo Scaccabarozzi, the president of Farmindustria, Italy’s main drug trade group, boasting that drug companies added 6,000 jobs in Italy last year.

Budget blues

The Italian 2016 budget law cut health spending by €2 billion, falling short of an original pact between the central government and regions totaling €113 billion.

The government now promises to restore that €2 billion, but whether this will happen is unclear.

Even Prime Minister Matteo Renzi acknowledges that the way Italy pays for its health care is not sustainable going forward and that the country’s National Health Service has already suffered more than necessary.

“It is obvious that too much has been cut when it comes to health care,” Renzi said on September 27 during a visit to San Raffaele hospital in Milan.

Despite Renzi’s reassurances, some fear that internal political upheaval and Italy’s tepid economic outlook — GDP growth is expected to reach just 1.4 percent next year — will wash out any health budget boost.

The prime minister has scheduled a constitutional referendum on December 4, in which Italians will decide whether to abolish the senate and give the party with the most votes in parliamentary elections a strong ruling majority. That could break any alignment between Renzi and the health minister.

“The Health Minister Beatrice Lorenzin and the prime minister are from opposing parties, and the latter will not make her any favors,” said a senior Italian government official with knowledge of the negotiations on the health care budget. “Therefore I would not count on more money.”

The health minister called any talk of cuts just “gossip,” in a recent interview with Italian media. Lorenzin, a member of the New Centre Right Party who was appointed by Social Democrat Renzi, said the two share a common goal for 2017.

This includes “funds for new anti-cancer medicines, especially for hepatitis C drugs, as well as a response to the need for new medical staff and new contracts for doctors,” she told Italy’s newswire ANSA in September.

Protesting doctors

Drugmakers aren’t the only interest group pressuring the administration. Doctors have threatened potentially paralyzing strikes for over a year.

The country’s largest doctors’ union in September said it was again considering a countrywide strike against the spending cuts, demanding a renewal of their contracts and the end of an eight-year hiring freeze in hospitals.

“I am extremely concerned by the extent of the crisis of our NHS,” said Costantino Troise, the secretary-general of Italy’s largest doctors’ union ANAAO.

He blamed funding cuts and what he called a lack of respect for health professionals as major drivers of the current stand-off.

“Italy’s health system will resemble ones like Poland and Slovenia rather than France and Germany” if the situation doesn’t improve, he said. The latter Western countries tend to be known for higher quality health care than their Eastern brethren.

After long negotiations between the unions and the government in March, a 48-hour planned strike billed as the biggest in decades was postponed. The health minister had reassured unions that the renewal of their contracts would be among her priorities when negotiating her budget with the rest of the government.

Lorenzin has promised repeatedly that she will “start the process to renew contracts” and “stabilize temporary employees.”

That hasn’t happened so far.

New drug math

As is the case elsewhere in Europe, rising costs for specialty and complex biotech drugs to treat ailments like cancer and hepatitis C are a major factor in health system struggles.

The costs of new medicines overshot the budget for all of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 in nearly each region, according to a government report on pharmaceutical spending.

Italian law mandates the regions spend no more than 14.85 percent of the total health care budget on pharmaceuticals. So far this year, localities have already breached that threshold by spending 17.4 percent, or about €8.3 billion, on drugs.

Drugmakers call the ceiling unrealistic and complain about a related system in which the government can take back funds above a spending threshold.

The Italian government is now weighing changes to how it calculates and accounts for health care spending, in line with a broader movement by governments in Europe away from paying for drugs based only on volume.

The government has to get out of the “silos mentality” said Luca Pani, director general of AIFA, the Italian agency in charge of drug pricing and reimbursement. He refers to new approaches to fund expensive drugs based on the overall cost to the system. That would include money saved, for example, by reduced hospital stays or avoided liver transplants in patients with hepatitis who recover.

“We also avoid lost working days [from certain new drugs], which also saves money. We should take all this saved money and use it for example for innovative drugs,” he said.

Trade group Farmindustria largely supports that strategy, in theory.

Payback time

Another sticking point with pharmaceutical companies is a pay-back scheme set up by the government to keep costs down.

Every year the Italian National Health Service sets a budget it can spend on pharmaceuticals and strikes deals with each drug company. Any spending above that amount must be paid back to the regions by the drugmakers.

The agreements with each drugmaker are based on complex assumptions about demand and market prices, but the companies often dispute how the regions do the math. Prior appeals have yielded them discounts.

“Drugmakers are fed up with the pay-back mechanism; they cannot and will not keep paying as a result of a threshold for pharmaceutical expenditure that is clearly too low,” said Scaccabarozzi of Farmindustria.

The world’s biggest drugmakers are on the hook, according to the government’s latest calculation. Swiss drugmaker Roche faces a €158.2 million bill and U.S. giant Pfizer has a €69.1 million tab.

In August, several pharmaceutical companies appealed a government decision seeking €1.5 billion back. That case is pending.

Amid instability of the government and its finances, Pani seems to be more optimistic than most.

The long-term civil servant, who announced he will retire in November, said a major potential bright spot for savings is expanding his agency’s use of real world data.

Italy already negotiates for costly hepatitis C drugs based on data from 53,000 patients. The idea would be to expand this practice to other innovative drugs for serious diseases like cancer.

“This procedure should be considered an advantage for the industry as well, since they could end up with better results than the ones they obtained during clinical trials,” Pani said. “We are currently in a phase where the government has understood that we need to redefine the pharmaceutical governance of our country.”
