For U.S. diplomats in dangerous places overseas, the worst part of the job can be getting to and from work.

It’s not the traffic. It’s the danger.

A “variety of weaknesses” in the State Department’s transportation management program “continue to put U.S. personnel at risk,” according to a Government Accountability Office report released last week.

“Travel routes of U.S. government employees and their family members are particularly vulnerable to attack,” the report said. “From 1998 to 2015, more than 100 attacks targeted personnel in transit, including officials en route to work facilities or their residences. Several of these attacks resulted in fatalities.”

While State provides various protection methods, including armed guards, armored vehicles and training for staffers and family members, the weaknesses mean “personnel and their dependents are especially vulnerable when traveling outside the relative security of embassies, consulates, or residences.”

The 26 posts GAO reviewed had transportation security and travel notification plans, but policies at 22 locations were incomplete, lacking elements State required. The department “also lacks a clear armored vehicle policy for overseas posts,” GAO said.

A 2004 murder of a diplomat in Iraq, “was almost certainly caused by his failure to follow the post’s security policy,” according to the report. That killing led to six recommendations from a 2005 accountability review board. GAO later found that more than three-quarters of the foreign post policies it reviewed were missing at least one of the recommended security directives.

State provides training to regional security officers and other staffers on such topics as defensive driving and personal security measures. But when GAO investigators visited nine posts, they found “staff had difficulty remembering key details covered in new arrival briefings or described the one-time briefings as inadequate. State’s requirements for providing refresher briefings are unclear, potentially putting staff at greater risk.”

In four of the nine posts, employees received important threat warnings late. “In one case,” GAO said, “this resulted in an embassy vehicle being attacked with rocks and seriously damaged while traveling through a prohibited area.”

In a response included in the report, State said that before the attack, the embassy’s regional security officer “sent multiple text-based messages … warning employees the area in question was off limits to them.” State added, “employees must also exercise fundamental security responsibilities” by checking for safety notices.

State Department officials agreed with seven of eight GAO recommendations to improve embassy management of transportation risks. “The Department supports all initiatives that assist us in further refining and monitoring our robust security programs,” State’s response said.

Ironically, those risks might have increased along with increased security at U.S. government buildings overseas.

After the almost simultaneous 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi, which killed 224 and wounded more than 5,000, State improved security at U.S. facilities. More than 100 new diplomatic buildings were built and many others were enhanced. For those looking to harm U.S. personnel, that made soft targets where Westerners gather, such as restaurants, and commuting patterns easier targets.

“According to State, U.S. government employees and their families are most at risk on these transportation routes,” GAO said.

To mitigate that risk, State agreed to pay Worldwide Protective Services $2.7 billion for private security contractors to provide transportation protection in high-threat areas during fiscal years 2011 through 2016. The department also said it would spend $310 million on armored vehicles during that same period. Another $100 million was spent on federal agents, host nation police and local guards in 100 countries.

Individually, any of the security weaknesses is a cause for concern. But “in the aggregate, they raise questions about the adequacy of security for U.S. personnel and their families overseas,” GAO said.

“Until it addresses these issues, State cannot be assured that the deadly threats U.S. personnel and their families may face while in transit overseas are being countered as effectively as possible.”
