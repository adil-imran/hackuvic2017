Doctors' leaders have been accused by the NHS of acting illegally by urging activists from other unions to turn out in support of their strike next week.

The law says pickets should protest only outside their own workplace, not be bussed in by other unions unconnected a dispute.

There is concern that mass pickets at hospitals could distress the sick or their families.

In a letter sent last night, NHS England urged the British Medical Association, which is due to stage a walk-out of junior doctors on Tuesday, to 'urgently' withdraw its request for a combined show of union strength.

Junior doctors have made an extraordinary plea for hard-Left trade union leaders to join them picketing hospitals when they go on strike next week

A blog post on the BMA's website by Dr Yannis Gourtsoyannis, a senior member of its junior doctors committee, urged 'all concerned citizens, activists and trade unionists to stand alongside us'.

It was then circulated on social media by the BMA's own account and several senior board members.

Dr Yannis Gourtsoyannis, a senior member of its junior doctors committee, urged 'all concerned citizens, activists and trade unionists to stand alongside us'.

The article – written in the language of hard-Left campaign groups - said: 'There is no way that we can win this on our own. We need all concerned citizens, activists and trade unionists to stand alongside us in this fight.

'A victory for the Junior Doctors would signify the first real crack in the entire edifice of austerity in the UK. Please stand with us. And when you need us, ask us. We will stand by you.'

It gave the dates for industrial action, the times and urged other unions to bring along banners showing who they were representing.

But, under the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, picketing is only lawful if take place at or near to the person's own place of work.

This is to stop activists from being bussed in by other unions to create a potentially intimidating atmosphere.

Guidelines also state there should be no more than six people on a picket line. The BMA's blog appears to request large numbers should turn out.

In a letter sent last night, NHS England chief executive Danny Mortimer warned BMA boss Dr Mark Porter that the views in the blog post 'contradict your own guidance on how your members will conduct picketing in respect of their trade dispute. '

It adds: 'These views have been endorsed and disseminated via Twitter by your corporate account and by other officials in the BMA. Dr Gourtsoyannis is a senior official who speaks on behalf of the BMA. Disappointingly – and in breach of the law – he is clearly addressing his comments to staff who have not been balloted and are not a party to this trade dispute.

'His comments on picketing are a clear breach of s220 TULRCA and the Code of Practice on Picketing and they are also contrary to the guidance which the BMA has itself published on its own website.

'I would urge you to now ensure that this statement from Dr Gourtsoyannis is removed immediately from your website. I would also request that you enact a response which clearly directs everyone to your own guidance and makes clear that the comments made by Dr Gourtsoyannis are not compatible with that guidance and should not be followed.

'We are not seeking legal routes to stop industrial action, and we respect your mandate to strike action within the law. But I would ask you to respond as a matter of urgency as to whether you are prepared to take these steps and avoid breaking the law in relation to the conduct of trade disputes.'

Up to 45,000 junior doctors are expected to take part in the protests and nurses and consultants will be relied upon to stand in for them

Last night, the blog had been removed from the BMA website. It is understood it had previously also been circulated by the hard-left, pro-Jeremy Corbyn Momentum group.

Earlier this week the Chair of the BMA's Junior Doctor's Committee told members that unless they were treating emergencies, they would be expected on the picket lines.

Whitehall officials encouraged a health service boss to strengthen a letter that raised concerns over whether striking junior doctors would be available to respond in the event of a Paris-style attack, it has been claimed.

Emails reveal that Sir Bruce Keogh's letter went through a number of revisions to ensure concerns about the possible impact of a major incident during the walk out were made as 'hard-edged' as possible, according to the Independent.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt was also given approval of the text, emails between the Department of Health (DoH) and the national medical director of NHS England reveal.

Liberal Democrats warned the revelations raised 'serious concerns about potential political interference' and suggested that trust between the government and doctors would be damaged further.

Yesterday, the Mail revealed how a string of senior figures in the BMA have links to the Labour Party or have campaigned on behalf of its Left-wing leader Jeremy Corbyn.

Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the health select committee, said 'the upper echelons of the BMA are more committed to 'bringing down the Tories' than getting the best deal for their members and ensuring patient safety is not compromised.

She described them as 'Marxist union barons'

The BMA announced on Monday that they will stage three successive walkouts starting next week - which is likely to trigger the cancellation of thousands of operations and appointments.

Up to 45,000 junior doctors are expected to take part in the protests and nurses and consultants will be relied upon to stand in for them.

The first walkout will begin at 8am next Tuesday - January 12 - with doctors only treating emergency cases for a 24-hour period.
