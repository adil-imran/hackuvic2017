Singh has assured assistance to both Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa and Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to tackle the present state of unrest.

With protests escalating in the wake of Cauvery water dispute that escalated between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, the Bengaluru Police yesterday imposed Section 144 of the CRPC, meaning that no more than five people will be allowed to gather in public places in the city.

The protesters targeted vehicles bearing Tamil Nadu registration numbers and set them on fire. They also vandalised trucks near Hubli bypass in Karnataka.
