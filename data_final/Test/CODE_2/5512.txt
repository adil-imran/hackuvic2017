Teachers and students on Tuesday reported back to schools for the final and shortest term of the year during which Form Four and Standard Eight candidates will sit their national examinations.

School principals who spoke to the Daily Nation on Tuesday said they were looking forward to concluding the year without the distractions witnessed in the last term, during which dormitories and administration blocks in more than 100 schools were set ablaze by students over a variety of grievances.

The third term will last for only nine weeks because of the examinations which will begin in October with Form Four practicals.

The term, which previously lasted for 12 weeks, will now end on October 28 for all non-candidates.

Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i mid this year banned all social activities in the third term including prayer days, visiting, half term breaks, sports, prize-giving ceremonies and annual general meetings — to cut contact between the candidates and outsiders.

To rein in teachers who have been helping students to cheat in the tests, school principals will now be in charge of their examination centres helped by supervisors.

PREPARE FOR EXAMS

The Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet) Secretary General Akelo Misori said they were ready to help the candidates prepare for the examinations and asked the Education ministry of education to give them support.

This financial year, the government has allocated Sh32.4 billion for free day secondary education and Sh14.7 billion for primary.

The funds are normally released to more than 30,000 schools in three tranches of 50 per cent in the first term, 30 per cent in the second and 20 per cent for the final.

Those sitting for the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education exams year will start on November 1 and finish on November 3, while Form Four candidates will start the written tests on November 7 until November 30.

Dr Matiang’i said last week he expected the conduct of the national examinations to be free of cheating. He asked students to prepare well, saying the Government was determined to deliver credible results.
