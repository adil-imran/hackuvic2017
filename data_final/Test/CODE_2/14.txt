The executive vice chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof Umar Garba Danbatta, has disclosed that it has realised over N47 billion in spectrum usage and licensing within one year.

Danbatta, who disclosed this at a media briefing to highlight the achievements of the NCC under his leadership in the past one year, also revealed that the Commission had deployed four Anmtsu spectrum analysers, which had led to more efficiency in radio spectrum monitoring.

He said that the broadband penetration had increased from 10 percent to 20.95 percent within the year, adding that with the pace of growth, the nation might meet or surpass the recommendations in the National Broadband Plan, which is 30 per cent, in 2018.

He said the percentage on internet penetration in the country had reached a milestone of 47.44 percent, second only to South Africa in the continent.

Danbatta also revealed that N80 billion was paid by MTN out of the N330 billion imposed on it as penalty for infraction against the provisions of the SIM card registration regulation, adding that the Commission had written to the attorney general of the federation, AGF, for the transfer of the money so far paid to the account of NCC domiciliary in the Central Bank of Nigeria so that it would immediately reflect in the nation’s consolidated revenue account.

“We have reached an agreement with MTN in which they are to pay N330bn for over a period of three years. MTN has paid N50bn into an account of the federal government domicile in Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). We have written a letter to the attorney-general of the federation requesting for the money to be credited to the NCC account,” he said.

Danbatta who attributed the feat to the eight-point agenda he outlined for the Commission on his assumption of office in August last year, and commended President Muhammadu Buhari and the Minister of Communications, Adebayo Shittu, the National Assembly and the press for their support for the NCC and its new leadership.

He said the eight-point agenda, which were factored upon the tripod of availability of service, accessibility of service and affordability of service, had started to yield the desired results as the telecom sector now contributes more than 10 percent to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country.

He said: “We have been able to articulate a regulatory framework that will enable strategic and systematic licensing and deployment of broadband infrastructure across the country. A broadband implementation monitoring committee has been established within the commission to give proper assessment on regular basis of broadband infrastructure deployment.”
