Flat panels in all sizes are in short supply for the first time in 20 years, amid production adjustments by panelmakers and a surging demand in the market, Innolux Corp (群創) chairman Wang Jyh-chao (王志超) said yesterday.

“Panels for smartphones, notebook computers and televisions are all in shortage. The situation will extend to the end of next quarter,” Wang told reporters before the opening ceremony of the International Smart Display and Touch Panel Exhibition at Nangang Exhibition Hall in Taipei.

Wang said the industry in May saw short supply in panels for televisions and later witnessed a similar supply-demand dynamic for the small panels for smartphones and notebooks, after Samsung Display Inc, LG Display Co and Japan Display Inc (JDI) shut down their production lines.

The continued tight supply has also benefited Innolux, he said.

In light of the robust demand for panels and an improving average selling price, Wang said Innolux’s business outlook for the second half would be better than the company’s earlier estimate.

The company will monitor the end-market demand and channel digestion to see if the strong demand can extend to the beginning of next year, he said.

Wang declined to comment on whether the company could return to profit this quarter or next quarter.

The company reported its third consecutive quarter of net losses in the April-to-June period.

“The operations in the second half of this year are definitely better than in the first half,” he said.

At this year’s International Smart Display and Touch Panel Exhibition, Innolux showcases its first — also the world’s first — 65-inch 8K TV panel at its booth.

Wang said the company has started shipment of the product to some TV vendors.

Innolux has three Chinese and Japanese clients for its 65-inch 8K panels.

The company plans to ship a total of “a few” thousand units before the end of this year, it said.

The company will start to manufacture the 75-inch, 85-inch and 100-inch 8K flat panels in the first half of next year, it added.
