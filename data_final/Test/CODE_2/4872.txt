Oct. 10 -- FORT WORTH -- Chaz Gilley , 18, was riding a bicycle back from a Walmart Friday afternoon in broad daylight when he was fatally shot, his father said Monday.

"It's still an open investigation so I don't want to say too much about what happened," David Gilley said Monday in an interview with the Star-Telegram .

Homicide detectives did not release any details or motive for the killing on East Berry Street .

Chaz Gilley had attended Mansfield Lake Ridge High School , and had been working at Goodwill in Fort Worth , David Gilley said. He had just moved in with his mother in Fort Worth in the East Berry Street area within the last few weeks, his father said Monday.

"He may not have known very many people in Fort Worth , but he knew quite a few in Mansfield ," his father said. "He loved to hang out at Rose Park in Mansfield ."

A balloon release and candlelight vigil are scheduled this afternoon at Katherine Rose Memorial Park in Mansfield .

The funeral service is pending.

"Please hold your children tight," David Gilley posted during the weekend on his Facebook page. "And tell them how much you love them every chance you can."

Chaz Gilley , who was living with his mother in Fort Worth , was new to the East Berry Street neighborhood, his father said Monday. The Tarrant County medical examiner's office had listed a Joshua address for him.

The teenager died Saturday from multiple gunshot wounds in his torso and extremities, according to a Monday ruling by the medical examiner's office. He died in the operating room at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth almost 24 hours after the shooting, police said.

His death was ruled a homicide.

The shooting call came in shortly after 4:30 p.m. Friday at 2350 E. Berry St. Paramedics who responded found Chaz Gilley at a neighborhood fire station, where a motorist had taken him.
