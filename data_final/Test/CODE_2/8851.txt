HARARE – President Robert Mugabe has warned vendors refusing to vacate the streets to stop taking orders from the US and UK ambassadors, Bruce Wharton and Catriona Laing.

Speaking at the Global Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) Expo at the Harare International Conference Centre (HICC) today, Mugabe said Zimbabwe will not brook to any interference from its detractors in London and Washington.

“Government will not accept the chaos of vendors resisting to be relocated, we want order and it only comes if they are relocated to designated vending stalls and trade openly where the authorities assign them,” said Mugabe.

He said the sanctions induced hardships brought about many challenges and vending was one way of cushioning the situation.

Speaking on the wanton dismissal of workers by companies following a Supreme Court ruling, President Mugabe said the law should be amended.

He said ‘we cannot blame the judges as they interpreted the law as they saw it,’ but said the law must serve the people, hence the urgent need to amend the Labour Act.

The President thanked SMEs for keeping Zimbabwe ‘running despite the prophesy of doom having written the country off when sanctions were imposed all calculated to breed discontentment among the populace.’

He said he is internally grateful for entrepreneurs’ resilience, adding that now is the time to grow from small businesses to medium enterprises and on to become larger companies.

Mugabe said SMEs should be competitive by complying with local, regional and international manufacturing standards.

Highlighting challenges such as financing, marketing and training that entrepreneurs face, he said 25 percent of all government tenders have been set aside for them.

Mugabe has called for the urgent amendment of the Labour Act Act which has triggered an avalanche of job losses in the country based on the recent Supreme Court ruling on termination on three months notice.

Addressing guests attending the Global Small to Mediums Enterprises Expo, President Mugabe said the Labour Relations Act was giving workers a hard time therefore it should be amended.

“The law can be dry dry, dry, dry, dry, as Charles Dickens said, the law is an ass. It can rule, however the law is there to serve the people and not the people to serve the law. If the law creates problems for the people, then that law must be amended. You don’t blame the judges because they interpret the law,” he said adding “we admit in some cases there were ridiculous issues that without business, workers would still be kept and paid.

“Some companies are going down, some are closing operations. We are against the dismissal of workers. There may be a law which gives more power to employers, of course they own businesses. No one can dispute that if you no longer need workers, you can give them three months’ notice before terminating their contracts.”

“However we do not want to see people suffering in the streets. It is better to reduce wages than send people home as they still have to pay rentals and other bills. We will look at how companies should handle their workers as the numbers of sacked employees has now surpassed the 9000 mark,” he said.

He paid tribute to the SME sector for s sustaining the economy as it currently contributing 50% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs 60% of the population.

President Mugabe urged the SME sector to continue improving the quality of their products so as to remain competitive on the global market.

“The informal sector has sustained our country, so greatly resistant to political and economic enemies. Locally, SME’s employ more than 60% of the country’s workforce and contributes over 50% to the country’s GDP. SME’s are producing products of international standards and exporting to international markets.

“SMEs should however continue to improve their products as they have to remain competitive and grow from informal to formal. I urge SMEs to work with Government and the private sector so that they can be capacitated to increase the quantities they produce. I am happy that SMEs have embraced the concept of value addition as enunciated in ZIMASSET,” he said.

He said SMEs should create joint ventures to enable them to access far-from-home raw materials, new markets, and imported technology and managerial expertise.

He also called on the SME ministry to ensure that 25% of all Government tenders are reserved for the sector in accordance with the SME Act.

On agriculture, the President said one third of the $9 8mln credit line from Brazil has since been utilised in procurement and distribution of agricultural machinery to small holder farmers a move which is expected to transform the agricultural sector this year.

Weighing in on the vendor relocation debate, he urged vendors to co-operate with Government by moving to designated selling points.

He was accompanied to the expo by the Minister of SMEs and Cooperative Development, Sithembiso Nyoni and the visiting Iranian Minister of Cooperatives, Labour and Social Welfare, Mr Ali Rabiee and several entrepreneurs in that sector.
