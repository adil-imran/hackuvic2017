Nazir says ‘desperate’ for consultative council, Fernandes wants in

Nazir last week said the NCC which he is proposing should be under the auspices of the Council of Rulers. — Picture by Saw Siow Feng KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 1 ― CIMB Group Chairman Datuk Seri Nazir Razak admitted he is "desperate" for Malaysia to start the second National Consultative Council (NCC) or NCC2, a national platform for reconciliation.

In an Instagram post, the brother of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak posted a screenshot of a Bernama story carried by Malay Mail Online last week where he again called for the council to be formed to address the problems Malaysia currently is facing.

"Malay Mail chose this pic. Frowning in desperation. I hope people will seriously consider the idea because we need to gather the best minds and leaders from across society to come together for national recalibration.

"Our myriad of problems and tensions cannot be addressed piecemeal, it has to be holistic, re-making trade-offs and priorities for today's generation and challenges.

"I think we will be amazed by what can be achieved when true Malaysians come together in a spirit of moderation and country first. I know I am being repetitive but I am feeling desperate," he said in his post which carried a screenshot of the article titled 'NCC needs to be set up under the Council of Rulers, says Nazir Razak'.

Nazri's post saw a flood of comments from Malaysians including AirAsia group CEO Tan Sri Tony Fernandes who said he would be willing to be a part of the NCC and would even take time off from work to do that.

"The majority of Malaysians are moderate, they are just silent. Time not to be silent. I'm happy to take leave to be on the second NCC. Where do I send my curriculum vitae (CV)?” his comment read.

Nazir last week said the NCC which he is proposing should be under the auspices of the Council of Rulers.

The son of former prime minister Tun Abdul Razak Hussien has been urging for Malaysia's prominent to gather and form the NCC to push for reforms.

The first NCC was headed by his father after the infamous 1969 racial riots.
