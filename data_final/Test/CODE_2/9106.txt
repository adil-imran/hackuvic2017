FBI Director Comey: I released Clinton docs on Friday because we dont play games

Hot Air ^ | 9/8/16 | John Sexton

Posted on by Nachum

FBI Director Comey wrote a memo to employees Wednesday defending the decisions he has made with regard to the Hillary Clinton email investigation. One of those decisions was his choice to release materials generated by the investigation on a Friday before a holiday weekend. Speaking of the information prepared for release by the FBI, Comey writes:

We finished that process Friday morning with respect to the 302 of Secretary Clintons interview and our Letter Head Memorandum summarizing the investigation. I almost ordered the material held until Tuesday because I knew we would take all kinds of grief for releasing it before a holiday weekend, but my judgment was that we had promised transparency and it would be game-playing to withhold it from the public just to avoid folks saying stuff about us. We dont play games. So we released it Friday.

CNN reports that Comey has recently met with some former FBI agents who were not happy with his decision in the Clinton email case:

In recent weeks, Comey has met with groups of former FBI agents as part of his routine visits to field offices around the country. In at least one recent such meeting, according to people familiar with the meeting, former agents were sharply critical of the FBIs handling of the Clinton probe and particularly the decision to not recommend charges against Clinton.

Comey explains his decision not to recommend prosecution of Clinton saying there wasnt a prosecutable case.

At the end of the day, the case itself was not a cliff-hanger; despite all the chest-beating by people no longer in government, there really wasnt a prosecutable case. The hard part was whether to offer unprecedented transparency about our thinking. I explain to our alumni that I struggled with that part, but decided the

So Herridge appears to be correct. Yesterday Fox News Catherine Herridge suggested that this memo indicates a defense of Comey against criticism within FBI. I think the big takeaway here is that there is internal dissent, within the FBI, about Comeys decision and hes trying to quell that . . .

Imagine a Politically Weaponized FBI in Clintons Hands

Agents actively avoided catching Hillary lying and didn’t want the media to catch her either by Eddie Zipperer | Updated 08 Sep 2016 at 10:09 .............. Imagining a politicized FBI ready to do the bidding of another President Clinton is scarier than a stack of Stephen King books. Here are three signs the FBI is already putting politics before justice for Clinton: 1) The FBI tried not to catch Hillary in a lie.

If youre ever the target of a criminal investigation, dont bank on law enforcement believing whatever everything you tell them  unless youre a Clinton. The narrative Hillary sold the FBI holds water about as well as a slice of swiss cheese. She told them she thought a bracketed C was referencing paragraphs marked in alphabetical order which would make perfect sense if it werent for the total absence of A, B, and D-Z. Julian Assange blew this nonsense out of the water on Sean Hannity’s show last night, saying Wikileaks has released “thousands of examples, where she [Clinton], herself, has used a c in brackets, and signed it off, and more than 22,000 times that she has received cables from others with this c in brackets. So, it’s absolutely incredible for Clinton to lie. She is lying about not knowing what that is.” Not only did the FBI try not to catch her in a lie, they didn’t want the media to catch her in one either. Why else is there no transcript or recording of her FBI interview? Comey said he wanted to treat her like anyone else  so where’s the recording? Everyone else’s interview was recorded. Now, all the media can do is wonder what exactly she said to the FBI special agents. One thing’s for sure, if she told them any of the nonsense she’s been telling us about her emails all year, she likely committed a felony or two. 2) Does Obama have ESP?

It was almost like President Obama somehow knew how this would all turn out. When Comey delivered his “non-indictment indictment” of Hillary Clinton, he stated, “I have not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the Department of Justice or any other part of the government.” That seemed questionable given that at the same moment, Hillary Clinton was aboard Air Force One with President Obama about to make a triumphant, I’m-not-going-to-jail landing in North Carolina. Would President Obama be plane-pooling with someone if he thought there was a chance she might be indicted for mishandling classified information? In June, when President Obama decided to endorse Hillary Clinton for president  even though she was under criminal investigation  did that not send a message to the FBI regarding how he’d like to see the case decided? What if the president had endorsed a candidate who turned out to be a criminal? There’s no question that the president would have wound up looking supremely ridiculous if Hillary had been indicted. He sure got lucky. 3) The FBI uses holidays as human shields.

Remember when the FBI interrog- er, I mean, “interviewed” Hillary Clinton? It was the Saturday morning of July 4 weekend. Americans were on boats, at fireworks stores, prepping for cookouts, and engaging in other holiday weekend activities. Nobody was paying attention. News shows were stuck with backups to the backup hosts covering gigantic election news for only a tiny slice of the people who would normally be paying attention. Then, Comey announced two days later there would be no charges. They must have done a real deep analysis of the answers she gave. Jump cut to last weekend where the FBI used another holiday as a human shield. This time it was Labor Day watering down the news from the FBI’s data dump. Even House Speaker Paul Ryan was floored by how political the move seemed, saying, “I can’t believe that they would do what is such a patently political move.” Nothing is scarier than government institutions serving political agendas, but it seems to be a core principle of progressive leadership. Are #NeverTrump Republicans really so obsessed with philosophical purity that they’ll allow Hillary Clinton to become president and continue to the politicization of our bureaucracy? What if voting against Trump means an America where we can’t see where the FBI ends and the Clinton Foundation begins?

I saw a former director assistant (Kallstrom? Kollstrom?) interviewed on Kelly the other night. He said MANY are very angry at what Comey did, and what it has done to the integrity of the FBI. He says he’s heard from over 50 agents.

there wasnt a prosecutable case.

This is exactly true! The Federal Government is so corrupt now that there isn’t a single prosecutor who would take the case. They all want to live, and crossing Hillary is not healthy.

To: Nachum

“We don’t play games”? Is that some sort of a mocking joke? He humiliated the FBI in front of the entire country, a state from which it is yet to recover, if ever. If their investigators lifted lip prints they’d find his all over Hillary’s wrinkled butt. He knowingly and openly allowed a felon to walk because of who she is, contrary to every ideal that the FBI in particular and law enforcement in America in general is built upon. He is a disgrace to his name, his craft, and the position entrusted to him, and if he thinks an outraged country he betrayed is going to cease talking about it for his own personal comfort, he’s dreaming.



To: Nachum

We live in a time of monumental and universal deceit. Those in authority routinely state the precise opposite of the truth (as opposed to merely a lie) with a straight face, repeatedly, on every issue--whether it's the economy, health, history, culture--the facts themselves, all of which is repeated ad infinitum by the mainstream media. It's ubiquitous now . . . and breathtaking. Trump must win and the purge of those now in authority, who are all obviously on the take, must begin. May half a million subpoenas bloom.



To: Nachum

“We don’t play games.” “I am not a crook.”



To: Nachum

An old Clinton trick that Comey has learned well....Tell them that you “don't do” when it is exactly what you are “doing.”

No one would have complained about the (fake) results being released on Tuesday after the holiday. Comey was following orders, for sure, by playing games.

Anyone with half a brain can easily read between the lines of this memo that there is severe unrest in the FBI ranks over Comey's actions (and/or his lack of action). Even the apparent urgent need to put such a memo out at all is also proof of disapproval and bitterness in the ranks. Leni

“Comey explains his decision not to recommend prosecution of Clinton saying there wasnt a prosecutable case. He said there wasn't intent. She certainly did have intent to obstruct. All her email and device maneuvering was to hide communication that connects her work as SoS to the Foundation. That is obstruction of justice. Simple.

But look at it through his eyes: he's unable to do the honorable thing and resign for the same reason, probably, that he has played the strategy someone else, probably, gave him. How Kallstrom ended up on this story taking the temperature of the back room boys at the agency is a bigger mystery than anything else.

The Math: There are what, 6 big holidays a year, so what are the chances that a release would happen on the cusp of a holiday weekend? Something north of 1 in 30. SOOoooo . it happened 4 times in one year, so 30 x 30 x 30 x 30 = ONE chance in 810,000. James Comey, you had me fooled ..for awhile.

Comey is a former board member of the Clinton Foundation. The Foundation has a network which has traduced various government institutions such as the FBI and the Department of State. The problem is that Comey now has a revolt on his hands inside the FBI. Rightly so. No games indeed. Hillary is now losing the election. GO TRUMP!

How the FBI Went Easy on Hillary Clinton

Published September 9, 2016 By Paul Sperry, The New York Post Its clear now the FBI conducted a sweetheart investigation into Hillary Clintons e-mail shenanigans that appears to have been fixed from the start to go nowhere. Far from exonerating Clinton, the nearly 60 pages of documents expose both the systematic destruction of subpoenaed evidence by Clintons aides and the curious lack of interest by investigators in recovering it. Agents also failed to resolve unanswered questions, reconcile contradictory testimony or sweat uncooperative witnesses. Comey declared the investigation free of undue influence three days after his agents interviewed Clinton at FBI headquarters under special terms. Agents werent allowed to Mirandize Clinton or place her under oath, even though she was the subject of a criminal investigation possibly involving espionage. They werent even allowed to record her answers. Whats more, Comey made the two FBI agents who interviewed Clinton  along with all agents and forensic analysts involved in the so-called investigation  sign non-disclosure agreements gagging them from talking about the case even with other employees. Comey even let Clintons State Department aides Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson sit in on the interview with Clintons other lawyers, despite the glaring conflict of interest. FBI documents make clear Mills and Samuelson led the effort to search and destroy Clintons subpoenaed e-mails and shouldve been prime targets of the investigation. Comey didnt even attend her interview and, per his testimony, only read a summary of it. The FBI failed to pursue even the most basic lines of questioning. When Clinton pleaded ignorance about basic classification symbols, agents couldve produced the State documents she signed acknowledging she was briefed about how to ID and handle classified information at the highest levels.
