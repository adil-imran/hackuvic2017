Donald Trump is paying tribute to border patrol agents and to the families of those whose loved ones were murdered by immigrants in the nation illegally.

The Republican nominee brought several agents and women onstage with him at a rally in Austin, Texas, Tuesday night. He used them to highlight his call to build a border wall with Mexico and deport violent immigrants.

Trump is expected to unveil his full immigration plan next week. He has suggested he may back off his earlier vow to deport all 11 million immigrants in the nation illegally.

Trump's foray into reliably red Texas is unusual. But aides said Trump made the visit to Texas to hold a pair of fundraisers and reiterate his plan to toughen border security.

Donald Trump says life in the United States for African-Americans is "going in the wrong direction" and is vowing to help.

Trump says "a good education with a great paying job, that's success" in the United States. He says too many African-Americans are being left out, and promises his education and economic policies will aid minorities.

He asks: "What do you have to lose in trying Trump? I will fix it."

The declaration a rally in Austin, Texas, is part of a renewed push by the Republican nominee to woo black voters, with whom he has dismal approval ratings.

Trump also says he'll fight crime, repeating his claim that in many urban, minority neighborhoods, if "you walk down the street, you get shot."

Sen. Harry Reid says Donald Trump can't win in Nevada because there aren't enough "uneducated white men" for him to carry the state.

The Senate Democratic leader is retiring at the end of this year. He told reporters in Reno Tuesday that Nevada's demographics have changed so Trump can't count on support from so-called Reagan Democrats who crossed party lines in the past.

Reid says that change, combined with his belief that Republican women are abandoning the GOP's presidential candidate, translates into a November victory for Democrat Hillary Clinton.

Reid predicts former Nevada Democratic Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto will defeat Republican Rep. Joe Heck in the race for Reid's seat. He also says Democrats will retake control of the Senate and pick up seats in the House.

Chicago police are debunking Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's claim that department officials told him they can reduce crime by being tougher.

During a Monday interview on Fox News' "O'Reilly Factor," Trump said Chicago's police force doesn't have "the right people in charge." He added he met "very top police" who told him if a specific person were put in charge, violence could be stopped "in one week."

Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says no one in the department's senior command structure has ever met with Trump or his campaign staff.

Guglielmi said crime is best addressed by community policing and keeping illegal guns and repeat violent offenders off the street.

As of Monday, homicides in Chicago totaled 441. That's up from 296 at the same time last year.

When it comes to Donald Trump, Cher is not afraid to go there.

Speaking at a private fundraiser for Hillary Clinton, the singer and actress unloaded on the Republican presidential nominee. She compared him to Stalin and Hitler and said he reminded her of the murdering child character in the movie, "The Bad Seed."

"Consummate liar, doesn't care who she hurts, insane," said Cher at the Sunday event in Provincetown, Massachusetts.

Cher told reporters afterward that Trump is "a racist, he's a misogynist, he's a horrible person."

A video of Cher's remarks was posted on Facebook and first reported by the New York Times.

An excerpt of Clinton's remarks was also posted on Facebook. She said, "I can't tell you how excited I am to have Cher here."

Donald Trump is suggesting he could favor "softening" laws dealing with immigrants living in the United States illegally.

Trump taped a town hall in Austin, Texas, on Tuesday for Fox News. Moderator Sean Hannity asked the Republican presidential nominee if he would change any statute to accommodate law-abiding citizens or those with children.

Trump answered, "There certainly can be a softening because we're not looking to hurt people. We want people, we have some great people in this country."
