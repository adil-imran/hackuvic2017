HARARE - Three MDC Glen View activists — who have been on trial for the past five years — were yesterday convicted of murdering police inspector Petros Mutedza with actual intent.

The presiding judge Chinembiri Bhunu yesterday convicted Tungamirai Madzokere, Last Maengahama and Yvonne Musarurwa, after ruling that the State managed to prove its case beyond any reasonable doubt against the three.

The trio — whose driver, Phineas Nhatarikwa, was also found guilty of aiding the commission of the offence — was part of a group of seven people that remained in the dock after 21 others were acquitted in September 2013.

One of the suspects, Rebecca Mafikeni died while in custody.

Out of the seven, Paul Rukanda, Lazarus Maengehama and Edwin Mhingiri were found not guilty.

Mhingiri, who is reportedly ill and is in hospital, and Lazarus were given their verdicts in absentia, after the defence lawyers told the court that they did not get enough time to advise their clients of the court date.

Bhunu said Madzokere, Musarurwa and Last had been positively identified at the crime scene and acted in common purpose with the “murderous group” that stoned Mutedza to death.

He further said Nhatarikwa, despite being an MDC driver and had visited Glen View to deliver some utensils, had committed an offence by aiding Madzokere and Musarurwa to leave the crime scene.

Bhunu deferred the matter to Thursday when he is expected to pronounce the sentence against the four.

The case had last been heard in 2014, when the seven — represented by Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights chairperson Beatrice Mtetwa, Gift Mtisi and Charles Kwaramba — were put to their defence.

The suspects were all charged with murder or alternatively public violence as defined in Sections 47 and 36 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act.

According to prosecutor Edmore Nyazamba, the group murdered Mutedza after he went to Glen View 3 as part of a team that was assigned to disperse a group of MDC supporters who were braaing and drinking alcohol.

The activists started shouting and began throwing stones, empty bottles, steel stool frames and other missiles at the police.

According to court papers, the police were out-numbered by the group and Mutedza rushed to a Nissan Hardbody which he mistakenly identified as a police vehicle.

He was hit by a brick on the left side of his head and fell down, the State said.

The group kicked him until he became unconscious. He was rushed to Harare Central Hospital where he died on arrival.
