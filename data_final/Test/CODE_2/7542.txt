Prime Minister Hun Sen slammed critics for saying he was threatening potential protesters, telling a crowd of young students yesterday that his warnings of armed violence against demonstrations were stronger than threats, as he had the power to bring them to fruition and “eliminate” anyone found “destroying security and social order.”



At a graduation ceremony for Panha Chiet University students yesterday at the National Institute of Education, Mr. Hun Sen said he had already told army leaders to be “ready to prevent” any protests with armed force – all before saying the country was not in crisis and was perfectly peaceful.



The prime minister then goaded the opposition, saying they were the ones whose threats fell flat. All they could do, he said, was threaten mass demonstrations while he could actually carry out armed military violence against protesters through the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces, the navy, and the air force – something he seemed particularly proud of.



“Some Facebook users said Mr. Hun Sen has threatened them, but I think this is not a threat. It is stronger than a threat because I can order the elimination of anyone who destroys security and social order,” he told the students.



The ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) and the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) have been trading barbs for the past two weeks since opposition leader Kem Sokha was sentenced to five months in prison for failing to appear as a witness in a prostitution case earlier this month.



The opposition has threatened mass demonstrations akin to 2013, when swarms of people crowded the streets after the disputed national election.



But the premier has been defiant, openly threatening to use armed force to shut down any protests against him or the government.



After the United Nations and a group of 39 nations both criticized the government’s recent actions towards the opposition and human rights officials, Mr. Hun Sen increased the threats, joining with army officials to tell the country that anyone joining in protests with the opposition would face the consequences.



Despite the physically hostile threats against an opposition made up largely of activists and human rights workers, Mr. Hun Sen repeated that the country was at peace.



But he contradicted himself on an almost sentence-to-sentence basis, saying he would do anything, including using violence led by the army, to preserve the “peace, political stability and social order” of Cambodia.



He criticized any and all protests, saying they disrupted business and distracted people from the country’s real needs, which he believes are development and trade, eventually telling the crowd of students that the army was not the only group backing him.



“Do not think, like a Facebook user from Kampuchea Krom said, that one side has the army and the other side has the people?” he asked.



“You’re wrong. The ruling party has more supporters, and that is why they win and are the ruling party. So we have support from both the people and the army. Do not always threaten demonstrations.



“If you want to discuss things, tell me. The only way is [through] parliament.”



As evidence that the country was not in crisis, he claimed that students were passing Grade 12 exams in record numbers and continued to study hard. Nearly two million people have registered to vote already, he added.



“If the country is in crisis, how could they do any of that?” he said. “Do not take individual cases as political cases. I can confirm that there is not an internal crisis in the country. For your [CNRP] crisis, it is to deal with the court. It has nothing to do with the competence of political parties or the government.”



Critics both in Cambodia and abroad have decried the government’s ramped up efforts to use the military as a way to quell dissent against them. A committee in the United States Congress passed a resolution earlier this month demanding the government respect human rights and stop its persecution of opposition party members and activists.



On September 6, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Ravina Shamdasani specifically cited the ruling party’s kinship with the army as “deeply worrying.”



“This, combined with an increase in rhetoric by high-level army officials, who have vowed to defend the ruling party against political opposition, is deeply worrying. We remind the government of its duty to take measures to ensure the safety of all Cambodians, particularly high profile political opponents,” she said.



Mr. Hun Sen has not stopped at just threats of armed force. Multiple times throughout the past two months he has sent either helicopters and navy ships or trucks full of heavily armed soldiers to drive past the CNRP headquarters in Phnom Penh, terrifying party activists and local residents alike.



Political analyst So Chentha said the role of the armed forces in Cambodia is to maintain national independence and the interests of the country’s citizens – not its leaders. When the armed forces fail to remain independent, they become a tool of any political party failing to uphold and protect the country’s interests, he said.



“I want to see a judiciary, armed forces and other institutions that are truly independent,” he said.



The CNRP has said demonstrations will be organized if the ruling party continues to refuse to come to the bargaining table and stop its persecution of the party’s leaders. Mr. Sokha has been under de-facto house arrest at the CNRP headquarters for months.



They point to a bevy of party members and activists who are either in jail or facing lengthy sentences due to



what they say are politically-motivated charges as evidence that the country’s judiciary is being used to target them.



In a Facebook post yesterday, Mr. Sokha said Cambodia’s “political family” had to unite for the Pchum Ben holiday as an olive branch to their ancestors.



“If Cambodian politicians are upholding the four immeasurables such as love-kindness, compassion, empathy and joy, and have abandoned the three evil principles such as greed, hatred and ignorance, let our political family meet together to build peace for the nation’s interest and the citizens’ interest,” he said.



“If we do this, it will be good not only for our ancestors, but for ourselves, our children and future generations.”
