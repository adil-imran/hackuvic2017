Just eight months after David Cameron promised Britons “the best of both worlds” if they voted to stay in the European Union on his renegotiated terms, Britain is hurtling toward the worst of all worlds — a swift, hard Brexit on unfavorable trade terms.

The dynamics of British politics since the June referendum have vaporized the softer options with breathtaking speed, while London’s main continental partners have their own domestic reasons to prefer a quick, clean break. Some European government officials say privately that only a nasty economic shock will make the U.K. more realistic in negotiations on their future relationship.

In Britain, both major parties have interpreted the message of the June 23 Brexit vote as a mandate to leave the EU by the 2020 general election, control immigration and regain full parliamentary and judicial sovereignty. That, in essence, is what Theresa May, Cameron’s successor as prime minister, promised the Conservative Party conference last week.

But it is incompatible with staying in either the single market or the EU’s customs union. The former requires countries to implement all EU rules in national law and allow free movement of goods, capital, services and — crucially — people. The latter would mean continuing to let the European Commission negotiate international trade deals on Britain’s behalf, rather than seeking the bilateral free trade agreements with countries like the U.S., China, India, Canada and Australia that May promised.

True, May did say that the planned “Great Repeal Bill” to abrogate the European Communities Act that gives EU rules precedence over British statute would incorporate the existing body of European legislation into U.K. law before parliament starts the long process of amending or scrapping rules it doesn’t like. She also said the government would not roll back EU-mandated workers’ rights. That might appear to favor an orderly transition.

Yet the prospects do not look good for negotiating favorable market access arrangements for the interim period between the likely Brexit date in spring 2019 and the day when the EU and Britain reach an eventual agreement on a future free trade pact.

British business leaders and international bankers, who overwhelmingly backed remaining in the Union, are pressing Downing Street for a long grace period to ease the pain of Brexit. They want time to adapt before the EU slaps tariffs on imports from Britain and scraps the “passports” U.K.-based financial firms need to sell services across Europe.

The British have built a track record since 2010 of self-delusion, misreading European debates and overestimating their own power and support in Berlin.

It is not clear that May will be willing or able to pay the price for, say, a five-year standstill on trade and market access. That would likely entail continuing to apply both past and future EU laws and standards during the transition, making Norway-style payments into the EU budget for market access, and upholding free movement of labour.

The first two conditions might just be acceptable, although hardline Conservative Euroskeptics and the U.K. Independence Party would howl with outrage. Pledging to keep the door open to EU migrants for years after Britain leaves would be political dynamite — as well as an electoral gift to the virulently anti-immigration UKIP, which poses a continued threat to both Labour and the Conservatives.

Rise of the populists

Unable to resolve the contradiction between single market access and controlling immigration, May and her ministers are denying that they face any such choice. Perhaps some of them genuinely believe the time is ripe for European governments, under pressure from their own populists, to reinterpret freedom of movement in a way that is compatible with British voters’ concerns.

Last week’s strong statements by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande showed just how deluded that idea is. Neither is willing to countenance a debate about splitting the EU’s so-called four freedoms that would divide the 27 for the sake of a country on its way out. The unity and strength of the remaining EU is their top priority, as it is for the European Commission and European Parliament.

There is a strong determination in Berlin, Paris and Brussels that Britain should not get a better deal on leaving than it was offered to remain in the EU, and that the terms of its departure should be such as to deter any prospective emulators. When they negotiate with May, EU leaders will be looking over their shoulders at their own Euroskeptic populists — Marine Le Pen, Geert Wilders, Frauke Petry.

The government’s threat to make British firms register and report their foreign employees, even if ministers backed away from it after widespread criticism, alienated some of London’s friends in the EU. It reeked of the “national preference” ideology espoused by Le Pen and Wilders. How May can reconcile such knee-jerk nationalism with her vision of a “global Britain” open to the world is a mystery.

British efforts to sow division among continental Europeans by highlighting the potential cost of tariffs on imports of German cars or Italian prosecco have also been counter-productive so far. The head of the BDI German industrialists’ federation, Markus Kerber, reminded BBC listeners that only 7.2 percent of German exports go to Britain.

Diplomats note that even when German business chiefs did lobby Merkel against imposing sanctions on Russia, she brushed their pleas aside. Besides, German officials see potential investment gains for Germany as a result of Brexit, and they don’t see status-conscious Brits abandoning their BMWs, Mercedes or Porsches for U.K-made Japanese cars.

Conservative leaders are still asserting that tariffs would hurt the EU more than Britain because the Union has a trade surplus with the U.K. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary and Leave campaign mascot, is a master of this sort of “Europe wouldn’t dare” rhetoric.

Long respected as Europe’s most skilled negotiators, the British have built a track record since 2010 of self-delusion, misreading European debates and overestimating their own power and support in Berlin.

Now May has been forced for political reasons to set a March deadline for triggering the EU’s divorce clause — Article 50 — time is on Europe’s side, not Britain’s. If the two-year period provided to negotiate an exit treaty expires without a deal, economic ties would fall off a cliff and London-based banks would lose their “passports” overnight.

To avert that fate, the prime minister has fewer cards to play than her cabinet colleagues suggest. She should have understood this from London’s failure to draw key partners into exploratory talks before setting a date for Article 50.

Even Joseph Muscat, the pro-British prime minister of Malta, which will hold the EU presidency when May fires the Article 50 starting gun next year, sent London a stern message that it will have about as much say in the negotiations as Greece did in its bailout talks. So much for “taking back control.”
