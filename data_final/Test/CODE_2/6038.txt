CHILD Safety Minister Shannon Fentiman has rejected suggestions she was sidelined by Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk at yesterday’s announcement of members of the expert panel that will review the system.

Ms Fentiman has been forced to fend off attacks from the Opposition, who have been calling on her to resign.

“The only place these calls are coming from is the LNP,” she said.

“I’ve got the full support of stakeholders who are telling me they want to work with me and work with this Government to restore frontline services to the Department of Child Safety and continue the work we’ve been doing together to implement all of the recommendations of the commission of inquiry.”

The LNP have raised concerns about the Minister’s performance, who in turn argues Labor is working to restore resources to the system after the LNP cut more than 200 fulltime positions from the department.

The Premier on Sunday announced the expert panel’s members, including Bravehearts founder Hetty Johnston, at a media event. She defended Ms Fentiman, who was not present, at the event, saying “there has been nothing that has indicated to me that she is not fulfilling her ministerial responsibilities”.

Ms Fentiman today dismissed suggestions she was sidelined.

“I was meeting with members of the expert panel to see how quickly we could get this vital work underway,” she said.

“I stood up with key stakeholders on Wednesday to announce this important review. We immediately did some work to put in place an expert panel. The Premier came back from leave and made that announcement with the Commissioner who reports directly to the Premier.”

When directly asked whether the Premier did not want to be seen beside her, Ms Fentiman said: “Absolutely not.”

The Child Safety Minister accused the LNP of playing politics with the issue and said she was confident that the expert panel appointed would leave “no stone unturned in making sure we’ve got the strongest system we can have”.

Opposition child safety spokeswoman Ros Bates slammed the announced review as a “toothless tiger” and a “closed-shop review”, while continuing her attacks on Ms Fentiman.

“Shannon Fentiman is a minister who at (Budget) Estimates refused to take responsibility for her own department,” she said.

“This is a minister who has presided over 18 months now of increasing concern (relating to) the Child Safety department. Yesterday, she was sidelined by her own Premier. She couldn’t even attend a press conference because of a conflict of interest. I think the Minister has had ample opportunity to step up and protect the children of Queensland and she has failed to do so and she needs to go.”

The LNP has argued that its cuts to the department did not include frontline child safety officers and says the system was performing better then than it does now.

Ms Fentiman’s Cabinet colleagues today defended her, including Environment Minister Steven Miles and Energy Minister Mark Bailey.

Mr Miles said she was doing “an excellent job in what is a very difficult portfolio” while Mr Bailey described her performance as a “solid job under very difficult circumstances”.
