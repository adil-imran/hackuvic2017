Penang Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng's legal advisers are contemplating legal action against PAS' Nasrudin Hassan for not paying the settlement amount over a defamation case earlier this year.

GEORGE TOWN: PAS Information Chief Nasrudin Hassan has not paid a RM10,000 settlement amount agreed upon in a defamation case against Penang Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng, Lim’s legal officer said today.

Raja Syarafina Raja Shuib said it had been three weeks since an order was issued by the court to Nasrudin but that no payment had been forthcoming.

Syarafina said as per the court order affirmed on Sept 14, and subsequently delivered to Nasrudin on Sept 19, the latter ought to have settled the costs.

“This is an order from the honourable court for Nasrudin to make the said payment, as proof of his baseless accusations against Lim and to retract his article.

“Failure or ignorance on the part of the defendant to pay the sum ordered by the court is deemed as disavowal and contempt of the court order,” she said in a statement.

Syarafina said Lim’s lawyers had been ordered to take further legal action deemed fit.

Lim took Nasrudin to court for making a slanderous statement over the proposed undersea tunnel via a Facebook Notes posting titled ‘Apa Beza Kidex dan Penang Tunnel’ dated Aug 6, 2014.

Nasrudin, who is also Temerloh MP, had said the awarding of the project was made through direct negotiation and not open tender as publicised.

Nasrudin questioned why the then Selangor Menteri Besar Abdul Khalid Ibrahim was condemned in connection with the Kinrara-Damansara Highway Project (Kidex), but Guan Eng was spared the brickbats in the construction of the Penang undersea tunnel, which Nasrudin claimed was awarded via direct negotiation.

According to Nasrudin, the tunnel project, valued at RM4.63 billion, was fully financed by the Penang DAP State Government and awarded to the developer, Construction Zenith BUCG Sdn Bhd via direct negotiation.

In reality, the tunnel and three paired roads project was awarded via open tender.

On Jan 19, Lim dropped the defamation suit against Nasrudin after the latter apologised at the High Court here.

The settlement was reached between both parties via a consent judgement before Judicial Commissioner Lim Chong Fong.

Nasrudin said in court that he was retracting his article dated Aug 6, 2014, as it had been found to be baseless.

Judicial Commissioner Lim then ordered Nasrudin to pay Lim RM10,000 in costs.

When contacted, Nasrudin did not reply to requests for comment.
