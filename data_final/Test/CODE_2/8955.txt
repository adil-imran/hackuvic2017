Putin visits Crimea, ups Ukraine tensions

Russian President Vladimir Putin flew into annexed Crimea on Friday, a day after staging war games there, and said that he hoped Ukraine would see “common sense” when it came to resolving diplomatic crises.

The Russian leader accused Kiev last week of sending saboteurs who clashed with Russian troops. Kiev, which has fought a two-year war against pro-Russian separatists in two eastern provinces, denies that the incident took place and calls it a fabrication that could be used as a pretext for an invasion.

Putin has used threatening rhetoric, promising unspecified “counter-measures,” and has built up troops ahead of a military exercise next month.

TURKEY

Bank inspectors are latest to be detained

Turkish authorities detained dozens of bank inspectors on Friday and vowed to cut off financing to companies suspected of having ties to last month’s failed coup.

Turkey has detained about 40,000 people in its investigation into the July 15 attempted putsch, which it says was orchestrated by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen.

Police detained 29 inspectors from the BDDK banking watchdog, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. They were detained on suspicion of making “irregular” probes into the account of a government-related foundation and those of business people, including some close to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Violence in Kashmir overwhelms hospital

More than 40 days of clashes between protesters and security forces have overwhelmed the main hospital in Indian-administered Kashmir, where some patients with severe injuries said they had been beaten in their homes by troops.

House-to-house searches continued Friday, authorities said, for suspected ringleaders of street protests set off by the July 8 slaying of Shabir Ahmad Mangoo, a popular field commander of a Pakistan-based separatist group.

At least 65 people have been killed and 6,000 injured in the ensuing clashes, many of them wounded by shotgun rounds fired by security forces enforcing a curfew across the Muslim-majority region.

U.N. panel advances nuclear arms measure opposed by U.S.: A majority of countries on a United Nations-mandated working group is urging the General Assembly to consider launching multilateral negotiations on nuclear disarmament, a process boycotted by the world’s nuclear-armed powers, including the United States. Ambassador Thani Thongthakdi of Thailand, who chaired the Open-Ended Working Group on Nuclear Disarmament, hailed the 68-to-22 vote as a “strong signal” but said many countries would have preferred consensus among voting countries.

Trudeau promotes rookie politician in cabinet reshuffle: Canada’s Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweaked his cabinet Friday, promoting a rookie member of Parliament to fill a gap left earlier this year by the resignation of a minister who sought treatment for addiction issues. Bardish Chagger, the daughter of Indian immigrants, was sworn in as the new leader of the government in the House of Commons. Trudeau has emphasized the need for gender and ethnic diversity in his cabinet and Chagger’s appointment to the prestigious role further highlighted that.

U.N. to give “assistance” to Haiti cholera victims: Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is working on a package that would provide “material assistance” to cholera victims in Haiti, his spokesman said Friday, strongly indicating for the first time that hundreds of thousands of people affected will get financial help from the United Nations. The statement from deputy spokesman Farhan Haq follows Thursday’s acknowledgment that the world body was involved in the introduction of cholera to Haiti and needs to do “much more” to end the suffering of those who contracted the disease, estimated at more than 800,000 people.

London begins overnight subway service: The London Underground is starting its first-ever overnight service, a move city leaders hope will make the British capital a truly 24-hour city and bolster the local economy. The new service will run only on weekends and initially be available on the well-traveled Central and Victoria lines. There also will be only six trains running each hour. But the expanded service comes at a good time for London, which has been anxious to reassure the world that the city is open for business and ready to welcome tourists despite Britain’s recent vote to leave the European Union.
