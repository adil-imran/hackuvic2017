EXCLUSIVE: The former Secretary of State missed her last set of Hollywood fundraisers due to a case of pneumonia but Hillary Clinton is now coming back to the Tinseltown ATM next week for a hefty withdrawal. Just days after sparring with rival Donald Trump on October 8 in the second Presidential debate of this election, the Democrat will be in L.A. on October 13 for a deep pocket shindig. Billed as “the final Los Angeles dinner” for Clinton, the A-lister co-hosted event is set for the Beverly Hills home of 2024 Olympics bid chair Casey Wasserman and wife Laura.

The $33,400 to $100,000 a ticket evening huddle sees the long time Clinton donor gang getting together for what might their last hoopla before the November 8 election. The Democrat’s biggest check writers Jeffrey Katzenberg and wife Marilyn and Haim Saban and spouse Cheryl are co-hosting with the Wassermans.

Joining them as co-hosts at the gathering for the Hillary Victory Fund are Legendary founder Thomas Tull and wife Alba, Facebook backer Sean Parker and wife Alexandra plus Chris and Crystal Sacca, according to an invite Deadline obtained. All are long time and big time donors to the Clinton campaign and have been co-hosts or co-chairs to numerous past fundraisers in the last year.

Having performed for the ex-NY Senator at Radio City Music Hall earlier this year, Elton John is performing at the Wasserman’s pad for the donors – AKA can you feel the big bucks love tonight?

Hillary isn’t the only Clinton swooping into H’wood for cash in this month.

Former First Daughter and top surrogate Chelsea Clinton will be rallying the rich and slightly less troops on October 20. The $250 to $10,000 a ticket fundraiser will be held at the home of Showtime boss David Nevins and wife Andrea with “special guest” Kristen Bell. A host reception will is happening beforehand at the Hancock Park home of magazine moguls those repeat Clinton donors and fellow October 20 fundraiser co-hosts Michael Kong and Stacy Twiley.

Absent is ex-POTUS Bill Clinton, who filled in for his wife last month when she had to drop out of the September 13 scheduled fundraisers. Still, the deployment of both of the other Clintons makes it pretty clear the campaign is gearing up for an injection of big cash for a big ad push in the last days of the still tight race against the GOP’s Trump.

Of course, what the polls could look like after Sunday’s Anderson Cooper hosted debate is anyone’s guess in this roller coaster race.
