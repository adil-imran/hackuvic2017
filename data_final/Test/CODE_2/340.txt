Charge of being in IRA is dropped

Last December, Joseph Finnegan (54), of Cullenstown, Readypenny, Dundalk, had been charged with IRA membership and possession of two stolen cars, a Ford Focus and an Audi A4, on July 11, 2015, at the same address.

Barrister for the Director of Public Prosecutions, Tony McGillicuddy, said the matter was listed for trial last Tuesday but the accused could be arraigned on the charge of possessing stolen property which was a Ford Focus car. The court heard that the possession of a second stolen car, an Audi A4, was to be taken into consideration at sentencing.

Mr McGillicuddy said that the only other count outstanding on the indictment was a membership charge and a nolle prosequi (no prosecution) could be entered for that charge on the sentencing date. In June this year the accused pleaded guilty to four charges of possession of firearms and ammunition.

Counsel for Mr Finnegan, Micheal P O'Higgins SC told the court that the State was not proceeding with the main charge of IRA membership. Mr Finnegan was then arraigned before the court and he pleaded guilty to the charge of possession of a stolen car.

His barrister asked the court for 'as much time as possible' for his client to organise his affairs. Mr Justice Bobby Eagar, presiding with Judge Sinead Ni Chuluchain and Judge James Faughnan, remanded Mr Finnegan on continuing bail until October 24, when a sentencing date will be fixed.

The State did not object to bail on the same terms and conditions.
