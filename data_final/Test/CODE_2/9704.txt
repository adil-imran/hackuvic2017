Will Paul Ryan's panic attack hurt down-ballot Republicans?

American Thinker ^ | October 11, 2016 | Joseph Smith

Posted on by detective

The stream of down-ballot Republicans breaking with the Trump campaign over Mr. Trump's past vulgar language has now been capped by the notice from House speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) that "he will not defend or appear with" Mr. Trump, and that "rank-and-file" Republicans are on their own "to do what's best" in their districts. Ryan's counterpart in the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), for his part, is giving the presidential campaign controversy the silent treatment: "I don't have any observations about it." But The Hill observes: More than a dozen senators have either rescinded their support of the GOP nominee or called on him to step aside.

The Republicans are trying to sabotage their own candidates. What is wrong with these people?



To: detective

What PR did probably helped him in his race as grateful Dems will now support him. Of course he just pissed on literally every one else in the GOP.

Paul Ryan is the one who leaked the sex tape. This needs to get out far and wide. Ryan (and co-conspirators) must be EJECTED from Congress!!! If this the GOP! http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/10/report-top-paul-ryan-advisor-leaked-trump-sex-talk-tape-wapo/

Trying to win the hearts and minds of Democrat voters. It won’t work though because Democrats already have their own candidates and are loyal to a party. Plus , never trust a traitor, even if he/she betrayed your enemy.

A house divided Hillary’s ticket to the White House.



To: detective

They’re just being loyal to their masters.



To: detective

Will Paul Ryan's panic attack hurt down-ballot Republicans? Ryan needs to be personally punished, but there are hordes of GOP out there that should be speaking out, but are doing what they have for the past 8 years - ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!



To: detective

I hope so. This party just needs to DIE already.



To: detective

Ryan is scum. He supports "Open Borders" and that is ultimately what this is all about. I don't any faith in this happening even if Trump wins, but he should be immediately removed from the speakership. Of course many of us didn't want him to get it in the first place.

I just noticed a Drudge headline story. Looks like the media are really ratcheting up their propaganda attacks against Trump, almost hysterically so. They have declared the election over and will spend the rest of the time trying to establish their narrative. And it looks like some Republicans such as Ryan and McConnell are working with them. There is no telling how irrational they will get as the election draws near.

Everyone should personally contact their Senator or Congressman’s office to let them know that support for them on the ballot is dependent on whether they support Trump or not. I contacted Senator Burr’s office this morning and got the impression I was not the first to do so.

Ryan knows that if Trump is elected, his position will be untenable. He will be forced to resign and a much more committed conservative will take his place. Remember Ryan once said he did not want the job of Speaker but was pressured by Romney to take it so at the conservatives would be checked. Should have taken this weak man at his word.

He sure didn’t play that very well, did he. Quite lacking in strategery he is.

That’s eaxactly who it’s going to hurt. Most Trump supporters that I know are furious with Ryan and the other weasel who pulled their support from Trump and joined in democrat attacks all last weekend. They’re not going to forget this. I think most of them will not vote for any GOP candidate who participated in this attempted coup.

There is no telling how irrational they will get as the election draws near. All information from news organizations will become unreliable in the days before the election, just as in time of war. The MSM has turned itself over to Hillary.



To: detective

Well, I have come to the conclusion that the national GOP must die. My hope is that Trump wins and remakes the party in his own image or just starts a new one. That said, I will not be voting for my Congressman, Leonard Lance in NJ 7. He’s a typical RINO. Talks conservative and votes GOPe. If they don’t want to support us, I no longer support them. I have enough trust in Trump to be able to negotiate deals with anyone, but traitors need to be dealt with and Ryan is a complete POS traitor to the cause and to Trump.

What is wrong with these people/ The silver lining is that there's going to be a real DC housecleaning. The trash was all lined up; they must have known the coup attempt was coming. Pray that sane undecideds wake up and realize a Trump victory is the only way to get rid of the Dems who've backstabbed them. Senator Portman was way ahead in the polls and he (rather smugly I thought) said he could support Pence but not Trump. I now hope Portman loses, and I'm sure a lot of us Deplorables feel that way. OH is now in play for hillary because the 'pub establishment in this state doesn't respect their voters.

I will not be voting for any down-ballot Republicans. My senator, Pat Toomey, has refused to endorse Trump. So has my congreeman, Pat Meehan. I owe them nothing and that’s exactly what I am giving them.

Just the headline of this piece is a lie.There was no “panic attack”. This was a pre-planned orchestrated attempted take-down of the nominee chosen by the party’s voters. All concerned should be sanctioned and drummed out of the party immediately.



To: ObozoMustGo2012

Without a ton of verbage, Paul Ryan is destroying the GOP purposely!!! The Republican House memebers need to vote to get rid of as House leader right now!!! For goodness sake, spineless Republicans through this traitor, Paul Ryan into the nearest garage can...he is actively destroying all of you and the country!!!

To: detective

Hugh Hewitt today is saying the republicans are in trouble with Trump and that they may ask him to resign and something about Pence quitting the race. I thought Hewitt came to his senses but I know he is just trying to undermine the candidate again but be sneaky about it.

This was a pre-planned orchestrated attempted take-down of the nominee chosen by the partys voters. All concerned should be sanctioned and drummed out of the party immediately.” “Just the headline of this piece is a lie.There was no panic attack.This was a pre-planned orchestrated attempted take-down of the nominee chosen by the partys voters. All concerned should be sanctioned and drummed out of the party immediately.” From the article: “a weekend poll indicating that 74% of Republican respondents want “party officials to continue to stand by Trump” and by noting that “several top Republican elected officials” were booed when they publicly renounced Trump over the weekend. The author also reminds readers of the political cost to Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) for not endorsing Donald Trump at the convention. Mr. Kraushaar ominously suggests that “Trump supporters could punish new defectors ... by leaving the down-ballot portion of their ballot blank.” The fracturing in Trump's down-ballot support could thus have devastating consequences, according to Mr. Kraushaar: But now the GOP has to worry that by impulsively breaking their Faustian bargain because of a decade-old videotape, they may have cost themselves control of the Senate.” The word panic did not refer to the preplanned coordinated attack on Trump by the Republicans. It referred to the down ballot Republicans who were panicked into betraying Trump.

“Trying to win the hearts and minds of Democrat voters. It wont work though because Democrats already have their own candidates and are loyal to a party. Plus , never trust a traitor, even if he/she betrayed your enemy.” Arlan Spector learned the lesson at the end of his Senate career when he switched parties to give Harry Reid a veto proof majority. The Democrats threw him overboard for a lifelong Democrat in the next election. Jim Jeffords, switched from Republican to Independent in 2001, after being reelected in 2000 as a Republican. He caucused with the Democrats, giving them a 51 vote majority (the Senate was 50-50 after the 2000 election with VP Dick Cheney the tiebreaker). Jeffords retired in 2006. When he gave his farewell speech on the Senate floor he did not get the traditional Senate sendoff with dozens of colleagues taking the floor to pay tribute. Only one Republican Senator, Chuck Grassley, took the floor to honor Jeffords. Bernie Sanders was elected to replace Jeffords in the Senate. Democrats have a long tradition of treating turncoat Republicans poorly. Any Republican who believes he or she will benefit from helping Democrats or switching sides is delusional.

“The word panic did not refer to the preplanned coordinated attack on Trump by the Republicans.” The headline was “Will Paul Ryan’s panic attack hurt down-ballot Republicans?”. I stand by my statement that the headline is in itself a lie. The down ballot Republicans should be panicked. If their party had been willing to acquiesce to the will of their voters and get behind Trump’s movement the entire party would now be preparing for a stunning victory in a few weeks.



To: odawg

“And it looks like some Republicans such as Ryan and McConnell are working with them.” To his credit McConnell is laying low in the weeds instead of joining Ryan in feeding the media frenzy. Mitch is a survivor and knows there will be hell to pay if Trump should squeak out a win. Ryan on the other hand is fully committed to a Trump defeat. If Trump should win, it is difficult to see how Ryan can remain leader of the Republican Party in the House, much less the Speaker should the GOP retain the House.



To: minnesota_bound

Naturally Ben Shapiro just threw in the towel saying it is over. He cited Hugh Hewitt comment from this morning. The RINOs are doing everything to defeat Trump and not a criminal known as Clinton.



To: Junk Silver

“I stand by my statement that the headline is in itself a lie.” I interpreted the headline as saying Ryan and the people behind this were trying to get the down ticket Republicans to panic. Ryan and the others were trying to create panic.

“The people” are members of the DC Uni-Party. They do not represent Republican constituencies or conservatives. They are there for their share of the loot and power.

This is the essence of it. Trump now knows exactly who the confederates are. They will have no place of influence in his administration. Favors done by the Trump White House will be few and far between. And come ‘18, these miscreants will most assuredly face primary opposition with the disadvantage of the White House not supporting them. This is their bed. They’ve made it. They must live with it, but most will try and wiggle and squirm out of accepting any responsibility for their words and actions. What a sorry state our politics finds itself in today. CA....

Mine is retiring after 2 terms so what he says has no bearing. Not sure where the new Primary winner stands, he was the GOP head for TN for a while. Fairly conservative. There is no way I could vote for the unknown dem, and a write in won’t work no one even came close by a very wide margin. He has made NO statements. Now our RINO gov lame duck is another kettle of fish another ryan. He has his own Pilot Oil Scandal.

And Sun Tzu along with wise Persians knew what’s up long before now. Guess those turncoat Republicans thought they were too good for that old-fashioned advice.



To: detective

This isn’t complicated. Support Republicans who didn’t participate in the attempted coup, and oppose those who did. Relentlessly, continuously, and without remorse. Such is the battle for the future of the GOP.



To: detective

First off, who gives a crap about Paul Ryan? The guy is useless and I for the ne could care the less about him. Source of the leak, abandoning Trump, who he was never with, who cares. I am focusing on Trump s helping his campaign. I will vote down ticket as well, as long as Trump is on the top of that ticket. I will sort out the rest later. Secondly, who cares about Paul Ryan. Third, Donald, he ain’t your opponent on the ballot, stop caring about Paul Ryan.



To: ohioman

I will not vote for Portman. He's every bit the traitor as Paul Ryan Does he seriously think we've forgotten that stunt with starting the ball rolling for legalizing gay "marriage" out of "respect for his son"? That he was oh-so-sly about staying in the middle of the road instead of 100% supporting Trump during the RNC? Portman is disgusted about Trump's words, but not about his son's lifestyle or by Kasich not honoring his pledge? I do think that he made a political calculation that he's so far ahead in the polls that he can't lose. Time for a rude awakening!
