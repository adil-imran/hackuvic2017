Looks like he got his hand caught in the cookie jar

To: AmusedBystander

Glad to hear he is out.

The entire Wells Faggo should go under. They are nothing but a sodomite front group anymore.

Guys like this are what Andrew Jackson was talking about: Gentlemen! I too have been a close observer of the doings of the Bank of the United States. I have had men watching you for a long time, and am convinced that you have used the funds of the bank to speculate in the breadstuffs of the country. When you won, you divided the profits amongst you, and when you lost, you charged it to the bank. You tell me that if I take the deposits from the bank and annul its charter I shall ruin ten thousand families. That may be true, gentlemen, but that is your sin! Should I let you go on, you will ruin fifty thousand families, and that would be my sin! You are a den of vipers and thieves. I have determined to rout you out, and by the Eternal, I will rout you out!

Just another POS



To: AmusedBystander

Last month he was denied $41 million in compensation as punishment for the scandal. This doesn't tell the whole story, but that seems like a solid punishment for a change.



To: AmusedBystander

WHAH...? NO INTENT..! I don’t get it..! Throwing him out NEVER FED A HUNGRY CHILD..!!!



To: CatOwner

Probably a small fraction of his wealth. He should be in prison for life. As an example to the others.

Im sure he’ll get a gazillion dollar golden parachute.



To: gaijin

He’s a POS, sure, but people are losing the ability to distinguish between different GRADES of POS’s: How much MORE a POS is he than, say, Comey...? How about Eric Holder...? How about Hillary...? How about Loretta Lynch..? This guy is a BOY SCOUT..! THE ESTABLISHMENT rightly detects there is public outrage. Yes, for THEIR necks. So they just throw THIS honkey hair-helmet to the baying crowd. MEH..!



To: AmusedBystander

He should be in jail if the charges are true. There is no justification for that kind of Industry Sanctioned Customer Deception.



To: gaijin

These banks are just another arm of the Government.



To: Husker24

Iceland did it right.



To: gaijin

You nailed it.



To: AmusedBystander

WFC up 2% AH. Picked up some shares last week when all of the news was wall to wall negative. Nobody died. All customers will get their money back. This is small potatoes in the grand scheme of things, a great chance to pick up a good company at a discount.

There was a rumor of a run on Chase recently. To think that wells was always the stable one looks really bad. Would Trump break up the big banks? I know Bernie would.

I actually prefer Wells to Bank America for a nationwide bank

Didn’t the Dems hold their convention in a hall named after that bank?

“Hes a POS, sure, but people are losing the ability to distinguish between different GRADES of POSs:” This is what you get for leaders in a secular society with:

1) No standards

2) No ethics

3) No sense of decency

4) No respect

5) No virtue

6) No God.



To: AmusedBystander

You know what’s the most infuriating part of this? The photo dynamics orchestrated by his lawyer: They KNEW this photo would be coming, that it would be shown ALL OVER. It was his one shot at a TINY bit of sympathy. So his lawyer cooked up the SINGLE brace owing synergy with that shot —one that would adorn his RIGHT hand, upheld for the oath. RIDICULOUS AND TOTALLY CYNICAL. Chance it wasn’t a lawyer trick? 0.000000%.



To: AmusedBystander

like so many other establishment types, they get caught committing crimes that cost the citizens millions, if not billions, and instead of prosecution like what would happen to Joe or Jane six pack, they get off free if they agree to resign. No enforcement of the law = no law at all.



To: Red in Blue PA

I wonder if all the dead bankers the last couple of years were involved somehow in this scandal.

Wells Fargo is not the only one. Keep an eye out for more of this.

Big deal. No criminal charges for anyone at the bank equals more corruption.



To: AmusedBystander

...A representative for Wells Fargo said that Stumpf will not receive any severance payment.... It’s all in the way you say it...He is leaving with discounted stock options worth over 100 million dollars.

I agree. Well played, Red in Blue PA. Well played.



To: softengine

I am shocked at the response people have to this. Even my wife was worried we would lose money when I told her I bought shares. The media can really whip up a frenzy with little to nothing and this is proof of that.



To: AmusedBystander

How big is his golden parachute?

Looks like he had an "accident". Has he been exercising with Harry Reid?

To: AmusedBystander

Interestingly, he’s only retiring now that the story has been published. This didn’t just happen. An honorable man would have stepped down a couple years ago when it first happened.
