The Chief Judge of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Justice Ishaq Bello, has acceded to the request by parties in two criminal cases involving former National Security Adviser (NSA), Sambo Dasuki, and others that both cases be assigned to a single judge for determination.

Justice Bello agreed to the request yesterday when lawyers to parties had an audience with him in his office.

Parties had, on October 5 this year, resolved to approach the Chief Judge to seek his consent to have both cases assigned to Justice Husein Baba-Yusuf of the FCT High Court in Maitama to handle.

The need for the cases to be assigned to a single judge was informed by a motion by Dasuki, contesting the propriety of the existence of both cases against him at the same time.

Dasuki argued, in the motion, that both cases marked: FCT/HC/CR/43/2015 and FCT/HC/CR/42/2015 are identical and should be merged in the interest of justice and fair trial to avoid double jeopardy.

He argued that since he was involved in both cases with similar facts, it will be prejudicial and do great hardship against him, should he be subjected to trial on both cases.

He said he stands the risk of suffering double jeopardy.

When parties appeared before Justice Baba Yusuf on October 5 in respect of one of the cases, lead prosecution lawyer, Rotimi Jacobs (SAN), suggested that the court shelved the scheduled hearing of the motion by Dasuki, challenging the simultaneous existence of both cases.

Jacobs urged Justice Baba-Yusuf to allow parties approach the Chief Judge for the reassignment of the other case before another judge, Justice Peter Affen also of the High Court of the FCT in Maitama, to his court.

Although lawyer to Dasuki, Joseph Daudu (SAN), was initially inclined to move his client’s motion, he later changed his mind and accepted Jacobs’ suggestion.

Daudu, Jacobs and other lawyers in the case agreed to meet with the court’s Chief Judge to request the re-assignment of the case before Justice Affen.

They agreed to return on October 21 to report the decision of the Chief Judge.

Yesterday, after the lawyers’ meeting with the Chief Judge, they returned to report to Justice Baba Yusuf that Justice Bello has directed the reassignment of the charge before Justice Affen to his court.

Jacobs said lawyers in both cases were concerned over the delay experienced since last year when they were filed by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).

He said Justice Affen would also be informed about the development which will result in him yielding the case before him to Justice Baba Yusuf.

Justice Baba Yusuf agreed to the arrangement and adjourned to November 16 for hearing.

The first case involved Dasuki; a former Director of Finance, Office of the NSA, Shuaibu Salisu; a former Executive Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Aminu Baba-Kusa; and his two companies – Acacia Holding Limited and Reliance Referral Hospital Limited.

They are accused, in the case currently before Justice Baba-Yusuf, of diverting about N13.6 billion, property of the Office of the NSA.

The second case (that was before Justice Affen) involves Dasuki; ex-Minister of State for Finance, Bashir Yuguda; a former Director of Finance, Office of the NSA, Shuaibu Salisu; a former governor of Sokoto State, Attahiru Bafarawa; his son, Sagir Bafarawa; and their company, Dalhatu Investment Limited.

They are accused, in the second case, of diverting about N9.2billion from the Office of the NSA.
