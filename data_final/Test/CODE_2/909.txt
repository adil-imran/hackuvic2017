20:32 The Labour party has released a statement: “Jeremy Corbyn has today appointed the most diverse shadow cabinet or cabinet ever. “More than half are from the north of England and the Midlands. More than half are women. “Six are from the black and minority ethnic community, more than ever. “For the first time, two out of three shadowing the ‘great offices of state’ are women.” (We should point out there are four great offices of state. Corbyn is the fourth).



20:06 Women hold the balance of power in new team The team has 16 women and 14 men - a boost for gender equality. There are two women in the four ‘great offices of state’ and six ethnic minority members, the most ever. However, they do lack experience of Whitehall. One pundit pointed out none of them have held full Shadow Cabinet jobs in the previous Labour government. REUTERS

19:31 key event Meet all the new members of Jeremy Corbyn's team Jeremy Corbyn has flexed his muscle over Labour by promoting allies and bringing rebels in from the fold in a major shadow cabinet reshuffle. The Labour leader promoted Diane Abbott to Shadow Home Secretary and kept loyalists John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry in place. Outspoken deputy Tom Watson got a plum second job as Shadow Culture Secretary while John Healey returned to housing - and Labour has a shadow mental health minister again. But things were not so lucky for Clive Lewis. The ex-soldier got shunted from Shadow Defence Secretary to Shadow Business Secretary days after a row with the leader over his conference speech on renewing Trident. Jeff J Mitchell And some moves left rebel MPs furious, starting with the sacking of Chief Whip Rosie Winterton. Parliamentary Labour Party chair John Cryer sent a furious e-mail to all MPs declaring: “The party’s leadership did not engage in the talks in any constructive way.” Anti-semitism investigator Shami Chakrabarti meanwhile was appointed shadow attorney general - meaning she’s gone from joining Labour to being a peer in its top team in just five months. Here’s a full round-up of the new team.

19:04 'Jobs for geriatrics' joker MP Paul Flynn, 81, is off Paul Flynn is 81 and held two jobs until this reshuffle - Wales and Leader of the Commons. And boy, he liked to remind us about it. He’d waited years for a frontbench role and joked Mr Corbyn was instituting an employment scheme for “geriatrics”. Now he can rest easy. He’s back to the backbenches and both jobs have been filled. Leon Neal

18:51 Statement from Corbyn's team “Jeremy’s team have held extensive talks with the chief whip and PLP chair about shadow cabinet elections, and are ready to continue those discussions with the new chief whip. “Jeremy has made new appointments to the shadow cabinet ahead of parliament’s return on Monday to ensure Labour leads a strong and effective opposition. “Shadow cabinet elections will be considered by Labour’s national executive committee as part of a wider party democratisation at a special meeting next month.”

18:49 tweet Corbyn gets mental health chief... that he campaigned to bring back The return of Barbara Keeley as a shadow mental health minister will have Jeremy Corbyn’s aides breathing a sigh of relief. He faced huge criticism after Luciana Berger quit the role because he left it unfilled - just months after he created it. So few MPs were willing to support him that there was no one to fill the job. At Labour’s conference he faced more embarrassment as he was pictured holding a plea to bring back the very same job.

18:47 Three more quitters return to the fold Three more MPs who quit in a wave of 64 frontbench resignations in June have returned to the shadow cabinet. The biggest coup is arguably John Healey (below) who returns to the job of shadow housing secretary. He was a housing minister in the previous Labour government and still campaigns on the issue despite not having had a formal job to do so. The other two are Andrew Gwynne, now shadow minister without portfolio, and Barbara Keeley, who returns as shadow mental health minister. Trinity Mirror

18:45 Big coup for new Culture chief Tom Watson As we predicted earlier Tom Watson is the new Shadow Culture Secretary. It is a coup for the Labour enforcer who was known for his campaigns against intrusion by the press. It will also be a big olive branch for Mr Watson, who told Mr Corbyn earlier this summer that he had lost authority among MPs. Mr Watson made waves by claiming Trotskyist infiltrators were bidding to seize control of the party. But though he may disagree with him, Mr Corbyn can’t just be shot of Tom Watson. The pair are both elected by the membership.

18:44 Big Corbyn supporters including John McDonnell keep their jobs Many major Jeremy Corbyn supporters have, as expected, kept their jobs. They include Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner and Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry. Others keeping their job include Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Debbie Abrahams, who replaced Owen Smith. Rachel Maskell remains Shadow Environment Secretary and Cat Smith remains Shadow Voter Engagement Minister. REUTERS John McDonnell

18:31 Corbyn set to tighten grip on ruling NEC Jeremy Corbyn has revealed a plan to tighten his grip on Labour by handing a loyal MP a place on the party’s ruling body. He put Kate Osamor forward for the powerful NEC to replace Jonathan Ashworth - despite former Gordon Brown aide Mr Ashworth being promoted in his shadow cabinet reshuffle. Control of the 35-member National Executive Committee is on a knife-edge between supporters and critics of Mr Corbyn. If one side ends up with a thumping majority it could pass sweeping rule changes shifting the balance of power between Labour members and MPs. Read the full story here.

18:20 key event PLP chief lashes out over Corbyn's reshuffle style The chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, John Cryer, just fired the first shot in a backlash over Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet. He claims the reshuffle started taking place without being mentioned to the chief whip or him. In an e-mail to all MPs seen by the Mirror he adds: “It now seems to me that the party’s leadership did not engage in the talks in any constructive way.” Here is the email in full. Dear Colleague, As you will be very much aware, at the beginning of September the PLP voted overwhelmingly for the return of elections to the Shadow Cabinet. This has never implied that the entire Shadow Cabinet should be elected; neither the PLP or the Parliamentary Committee were prescriptive in that regard. This led to negotiations involving myself and the then chief whip, Rosie Winterton, and people from the leadership team. As far as Rosie and I were concerned the talks were held in good faith with the aim of striking an agreement which would allow some places to be filled through elections while the leader would retain the right to appoint others. We held a number of meetings, most recently during Labour conference, and were genuinely hopeful that we could get to an agreement which would have the chance of drawing the PLP together so that we could go forward in a more unified manner than has hitherto been the case. Rosie and I were keen to continue these negotiations this week and tried to arrange meetings with the leader’s office to come to an agreement as soon as possible. However, it became clear on Wednesday that a reshuffle was under way, which had not been discussed or mentioned. It now seems to me that the party’s leadership did not engage in the talks in any constructive way. Obviously, I deeply regret this turn of events. As ever, if colleagues wish to raise any issues with me feel free to get in touch. Best wishes, John Cryer

18:11 Tom Watson for Shadow Culture Secretary? One source is tipping deputy leader Tom Watson for the role of Shadow Culture Secretary. If true it will be a coup for the Labour enforcer who was known for his campaigns against intrusion by the press.

17:54 breaking news Non-breaking news It’s now an hour since we were advised it’d only be an hour. We’re still soldiering valiantly on. Meanwhile, other reporters are claiming it will be 7pm...

17:03 breaking news We are expecting a full shadow cabinet list tonight We are currently expecting all remaining appointments in a big chunk tonight - and shortly. This is likely to be a mammoth list, not a drip-feeding of information like we had last night. We’re also told the full list will clear up speculation about Jonathan Ashworth’s seat on the NEC, which seems to imply a replacement for him will be announced.

16:51 Ashworth says NEC boot is a 'decision for leader and shadow cabinet' Jonathan Ashworth has confirmed he is the new Shadow Health Secretary - but declined to say what will happen to his job on Labour’s ruling NEC. “Jeremy Corbyn’s asked me to take up the role of Shadow Health Secretary,” he tells the BBC. “It’s an honour to take up such an important role in the Labour party. I think the NHS is in crisis under the Tories. “I’m a member of the National Executive and it’s a post I take very seriously.” Asked if he’s lost his NEC seat, he says: “They’re decisions for the leader and the shadow cabinet and I’m not going to get into that today if that’s okay.” BBC

16:40 Does Corbyn have the power to kick Ashworth off the NEC? James Schneider, a chief of pro-Corbyn campaign group Momentum, wrongly claims Jeremy Corbyn gets to decide if Mr Ashworth stays on the NEC. “Jeremy as the leader is able to appoint people to be representatives from the shadow cabinet,” he tells the BBC. “I think it would be perfectly normal if he no longer were the rep. It would also be normal if he continued to be the rep. It’s not such a big deal. “It’s perfectly normal and right that Jeremy should appoint those, in the same way it’s perfectly normal and right that the PLP should be able to put in their ones.” But that’s not true according to the Labour party rules. The rule book states there should be “three frontbench Members of Parliament, at least one of whom must be a woman, nominated by the Shadow Cabinet.” That means a discussion and/or vote would take place when the new-look team meets for the first time next week. Of course, it is quite possible that members would vote to remove Mr Ashworth anyway. Here’s what the rule book says:

16:02 key event Shadow Health Secretary - Jonathan Ashworth Jonathan Ashworth is the new Shadow Health Secretary according to the BBC, which says he has confirmed the news himself. The job is a big promotion for the outspoken former Gordon Brown aide from the role of shadow minister without portfolio. But it is unclear whether what will happen to his role on Labour’s ruling National Executive Committee. Mr Ashworth holds one of three shadow cabinet seats on the powerful 35-strong body that will be pivotal for Labour’s future. It is understood Mr Corbyn intends for him to leave the NEC. One source claimed he would lose his seat. But party rules say this must take place via a decision of the shadow cabinet and not unilaterally from the leader. Ben Pruchnie

15:29 'Does your role include the Jewish community?' / 'I hope so' Dawn Butler, Labour’s new shadow minister for black and ethnic minority people, appeared unclear today whether her new brief covered the Jewish community. Asked if it did come under her remit, Ms Butler told BBC Five Live: “Yes, I hope so.” When pressed on the matter, she said: “As you know, it’s a new brief, so we are still, kind of, looking at what it will include in its entirety.” Ms Butler said that Labour had not been doing enough to deal with complaints against anti-Semitism and “all of the isms”. “It’s really important that we have robust systems in place, so that when somebody highlights, makes a complaint, raises issues, or queries, around racism and anti-semitism and sexism and all of the ‘isms’, that it’s taken seriously, and it’s acted upon as swiftly as possible. “The Labour Party hasn’t been doing that effectively to date. It’s important that that’s reviewed.”

15:15 tweet 3pm and still no shadow cabinet updates. Bring out the jokes It’s gone 3pm, and we still don’t have any new shadow cabinet posts. So whoever runs the ‘Corbyn jokes’ account has gone to town on the new line-up... ... And here are a few more from yesterday

14:01 Jack Blanchard Source: Jeremy Corbyn bidding to remove Jonathan Ashworth from Labour NEC Popular Leicester MP Jonathan Ashworth is already in the shadow cabinet but does not currently hold a specific portfolio. He has largely performed the role of frontbench attack dog for the past 12 months. He did not resign during the mass walk-out in June and has remained Labour’s go-to-guy when they quickly needed to take the Tories to task throughout the summer. If he is promoted to Shadow Health Secretary it would be a significant - and many would say deserved - step up.

He is not an opponent Jeremy Hunt would enjoy facing across the Dispatch Box. However a potentially even bigger power play is underway here. Ben Pruchnie/Getty Images Ashworth holds one of the three frontbench seats on Labour’s ruling NEC - the body which controls the party and its rulebook. Jeremy Corbyn tried to boot him off the NEC earlier this summer ahead of a crunch vote on Labour’s leadership voting rules, fearing the independent-minded Asworth would not support him. But he was unable to do so after the shadow cabinet rebelled against him. It is understood Mr Corbyn is now trying again to remove the independent-minded Ashworth from the NEC in a bid to tighten his grip over the party. However party rules state he can only do so via a vote of the whole shadow cabinet.It appears a final decision will be made by the new-look shadow cabinet when it meets for the first time next week.

13:28 tweet Unconfirmed source: Jonathan Ashworth to be Shadow Health Secretary An unconfirmed source says Jonathan Ashworth will be the next Shadow Health Secretary, filling the gap left by Diane Abbott. Former Gordon Brown aide Mr Ashworth is shadow minister without portfolio and fills one of three valuable shadow cabinet seats on Labour’s ruling NEC.

12:03 key event All quiet on the Western front... It’s gone noon and we’ve not had any new shadow cabinet announcements since last night. Has Jeremy Corbyn hit a bump in the road? We’ve not heard about any next steps from his team, but we were assured things would carry on today.

12:00 MP says Jeremy Corbyn has shown 'great guts' One of Jeremy Corbyn’s new ministers, Dawn Butler, has come out fighting for her boss. The new Shadow Minister for Black and Minority Ethnic Communities says: “Jeremy has shown he’s a leader of his time. He’s taken firm, direct decisions to ensure we have a full shadow cabinet to take on this Tory government. She dismisses concerns about the lack of shadow cabinet elections and the sacking of chief whip Rosie Winterton, who has been replaced by Nick Brown. “It shows Jeremy isn’s scared of putting somebody in a position who doesn’t fully support him but will do a great job as chief whip. “I think that shows great guts as a leader to do that.”

11:16 Third of Labour voters back SNP deal to keep Tories out A third of Labour voters in Scotland would back a deal with the SNP if it helped to keep the Tories out of government at Westminster, according to a poll. A BMG study for Scottish newspaper The Herald found that 33% would favour such a pact with Nicola Sturgeon’s party, while just over half, 52%, were against the idea. The survey also revealed that SNP voters have differing views on the issue. More than two-fifths, 42%, supported a coalition after the next general election to keep the Conservatives out of power, but 36% rejected the prospect. A majority of Tory and Liberal Democrat supporters - 75% and 51% respectively - opposed a deal between Labour and the SNP. Overall across Scotland, BMG found that 42% of people were against an alliance, 26% were in favour and the rest did not know. Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images

10:19 Mixed results in by-elections The challenge facing Labour was illustrated in a handful of by-election results yesterday. In the London borough of Haringey, the party strengthened its position, increasing it’s share by 12.3 points. But in Scotland Labour lost the Glasgow ward of Garscadden & Scotstounhill to the SNP. And in Hartlepool, Ukip came from nowhere to claim Headland & Harbour with almost half the votes.

In Caerphilly, one ward brought a small rise as Labour held Risca East, but the vote slumped in Gilfach as Plaid Cymru and Ukip took chunks out of Labour’s majority.
