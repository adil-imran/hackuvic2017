Campaigners pushing for new laws to deny killers parole unless they reveal the location of their victims' bodies have hailed a major breakthrough in their campaign.

Marie McCourt said she and her family have lived "a nightmare" for nearly 30 years not knowing where her daughter Helen is buried.

Helen is now the inspiration for "Helen's Law", which was given early support by MPs in the Commons on Tuesday.

The 22-year-old was abducted and murdered by Ian Simms in 1988 near Billinge, near Wigan, but her body has never been recovered

MP Conor McGinn has now brought forward his Unlawful Killing (Recovery of Remains) Bill under a 10 Minute Rule Motion.

This would change the law to deny killers who withhold information about the whereabouts of their victims' body the chance of freedom.

Ms McCourt told the Press Association afterwards: "I am very pleased at the response in the Commons that my MP Conor McGinn received when he presented his Bill.

"I and all the families who attended were very impressed at how respectfully the MPs received it, and we are looking forward to returning on February 3 for the second reading - and hopefully see Helen's Law become real.

"We are so grateful to everyone who has supported this campaign.

"This is a nightmare we have lived for almost 30 years and hope that a change in the law will see this control taken away from killers and given back to the families of victims."

Ms McCourt was joined in the Commons public gallery for Tuesday's debate by the families of other victims whose bodies have never been recovered, such as Carole Packman, Jonathan Dolton and Michelle Gunshon.

Mr McGinn told the House that families who did not know where their loved ones were buried endured "a special kind of torture".

He added that Simms could soon be released from jail, despite his failure to disclose where Helen is buried.

Mr McGinn said: "One is bound to ask in what sense a murderer, who is content to torment the families of their victims in such a way, could ever have earned their freedom.

"The introduction of Helen's Law is the only chance the McCourts and families like them have of securing some peace, and the justice they deserve."

Mr McGinn said since 2007, there have been 30 murders across England and Wales where no body has been recovered.

The MP for St Helens North said: "Killers who inflict this kind of suffering on their victim's families should not be released on parole.

"Denial of a final resting place is perhaps the last heinous act by killers who have no place in a civilised society.

"The agony and torment caused to those who cannot lay a murdered loved one to rest is incalculable.

"The families of victims expect, quite rightly, the law to act in their favour, instead of the justice system rewarding killers who decide to remain silent with parole.

"For those who have had to face the loss of a loved one at the hands of a callous murderer, there is nothing we can do to make up for their loss.

"But if there is a way to help them receive the justice they deserve, then we must take it. And if there is a way to compel those who have committed the most awful crimes to assist in this task, we must do it.

"If there is a way to ensure no family has to endure the suffering that Marie McCourt and hers and so many others have, then we, in this of all places, have a duty to act."

Similar rules have already been introduced in some Australian states, Mr McGinn told MPs.

The Bill was adopted by the House without opposition and will now progress to its second reading on Friday February 3.

However, without the support of the Government it is unlikely to ever become la
