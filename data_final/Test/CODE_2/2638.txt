Looks like Clinton is repeating the month of September. Very light schedule. Yesterday we saw the return of the coughing fits and saw video in NH, with her eyes rolling so far out of control, one has to wonder if she is possessed. Will she survive the next debate, will she make it until Nov 8?

She doesn’t have to. I fear this election, I really do.

Honestly it is very possible that she is possessed by the devil think about anti christian she has become.

Probably putting her in cold storage so she doesn’t croak too soon.

Some of the medical treatments she needs likely will take extended time to recuperate.

Hillary Clinton could have died 3 years ago and it wouldn’t matter. She has her media supporters, and the entire apparatus of leftist-statists, crony-capitalists and government dependents supporting whatever empty cliches her “campaign” issues.



To: bereanrabbi

She thinks she’s got it in the bag.

Hoping to run out the clock. Donald Trump has to see that this doesn’t happen.

That means the networks will be in Hillary’s Corner 1000%. Crowds freaking love Trump and he has energy he should not debate her again he should play to his strengths. That means having maximum contact with the American people and zero contact with the disgusting American journalist Networks.

BECAUSE THEY SHOW HOW PATHETIC HER SUPPORT IS! Trump turns away thousands more than she has show up. average for her rallies seems to be about 300 BORED people. Average for his is 15,000 enthusiastic people



To: bereanrabbi

She doesn’t need or want rallies where she has to rub shoulders with the great unwashed. She just needs to run attack ads and show up for the debates to show she is healthy enough and can spout memorized lines. The media will do the rest for her.



To: Brilliant

“...She thinks she’s got it in the bag...” That is the worry. Maybe she is confident that the corrupt democrat machine has everything already in place to rig a stolen election. I hope and pray this is not the case.



To: bereanrabbi

If you want to know what's behind this, just look at her campaign appearance in Florida yesterday. She looked and sounded awful. Her campaign staff knows full well that she loses support even among Democrats every time she waddles out on a stage, dressed like an oven mitt, and wheezes her way through a campaign speech containing nothing but trite, silly bullsh!t.

She doesn’t need to do anything except bait Trump and let him twitter himself into oblivion. We can only wish he’d take some advice and stick to issues and do some debate homework. He’s already got my vote but there are many others who need that final nudge and his actions aren’t reassuring.



To: bereanrabbi

Maybe she isn’t putting her events ON the schedule because people have a habit of leaking audio/video all over the Internet!



To: Mr. K

I’ll have to find the video, but there were more Trump supporters yelling “Hillary for prison” outside one of her Florida events yesterday, than there were inside her rally!! Oh found it - https://twitter.com/TRUNEWS/status/781885025285316609?s=09

Yep, he should be more like Romney and just take it /s

I'm curious to know what kind of medical treatments she needs? Because if she is able to hold it together for a 90 minute debate, she must be on medication that has a downside afterward. Assuming, of course, that she has a debilitating medical condition., e.g., Parkinson's.

1. her political handlers know that voters are turned OFF whenever she speaks, so they’re keeping her in the closet as much as possible (certainly there’s not been a major party political candidate in my lifetime who’s avoided the public/voters MORE than HilLIARy!!! its a story in itself, how she’s so avoiding public meetings, press conferences, and campaigning of almost all kinds except when she can suck up even more BIG MONEY “contributions”/bribes ....) 2. her medical condition won’t permit her to campaign very much and her political handlers are afraid of letting the public learn anything more about her obviously frail condition

I agree. First you have to find a virgin. And we know how difficult that is. Then you need to drain the blood just right. Plus you have to keep her out of the sun. It is almost TOO much work.

There sure are lots of concern trolls here today. If I understand most of you, it appears that if Hillary does not go out on the campaign trail that is a positive thing for her because then it is indicating that she thinks she has it in the bag which means that she MUST have it in the bag.... Right? So following my logic to the end we can surmise that campaigning is a bad thing and the more you campaign the worse you’ll do, while not campaigning shows confidence, so that’s a good thing and the better you’ll do. Do I have this right? Is there any thought given to the fact that perhaps she really is ill and the fact that Donald Trump is making 2 and 3 campaign stops daily is putting an inordinate amount of stress on her and she just cannot keep up, although she has been trying for the last several days since the debate. It does seem that now she may have run out of gas again.



To: Hildy

Have no fear... There won’t be an ability to cheat because Trump will be winning by a landslide. Hillary is failing with Democrats. They really wanted Bernie but the ended up with her because it’s ‘her turn’, and her entitlement attitude is wearing thin within her own party and with the public in general. Hillary has never been a popular choice. Let’s face it, she couldn’t beat a junior senator from Illinois with absolutely no experience and she barely defeated a senile socialist. Do you really think she even has a chance against Trump?

If you want to know what’s behind this, just look at her campaign appearance in Florida yesterday. The Sunrise Theater , where she appeared has a capacity of 1200... We don’t know if she even filled that. She doesn’t dare play the size of arena he does...

Probably massive amounts of meds. Check her post rally/event press conferences; she looks worn out. Especially the ones after the mall shooting and the debate.

The media will carry her ... and the less she’s actually seen the better she does. All part of the plan. But the plan will fail.

Please point to the video. Go to the conservative treehouse. Sundance has loads of video and analysis on sick, old Hillary.

She thinks shes got it in the bag. I don't think so. It's a calculated move. 1) She's very sick and doesn't have the energy for campaigning. 2) The more she's in the public eye, the worse she does. That pattern has been repeated with her for decades. If she sits on her ass for the last month or two, then she'll likely increase her chances of winning. No good can come from her being out and about and she knows it.

I think she knows the fix is in so she’s phoning it in. Same thing Obama did in 2012.

I hope she makes it through her loss in the election. After that, who gives a rat’s a** what happens to her? On second thought, it would be great if President Trump’s AG has her arrested for treason (along with bill and chelsea for financial crimes).

How pathetic must the Republicans must be? (rhetorical question)

Obviously very few have stood up so they are at the very least complicit.

Anyhow,they can barely beat a half dead 30 year politician and all around hag? And they wanted Jeb to do what probably only a Trump could do. Take down this sick old women!

And their top choices in elections past Dole, McCain and Romney? WOW!

She has, in effect, suspended her campaign, and did so right after the convention. The media allow her to get away with it, just like they allowed her to get away with having Seth Rich murdered.
