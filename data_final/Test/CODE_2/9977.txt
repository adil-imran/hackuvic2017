Was the morning episode (manhandling of the CM) a rehearsal to it," Sisodia tweeted.Senior AAP leader Sanjay Singh charged that the police first informed the that Kejriwal would not be given any security cover and then got the Chief Minister attacked."Modiji's police first told the (about its inability) to provide security cover and then got attacked. Is any conspiracy brewing against the Chief Minister," Singh tweeted.The Police had yesterday turned down the request from Kejriwal's office to send security personnel to by road.Kejriwal is on a four-day visit to poll-bound beginning today.
