— The Latest on the U.S. presidential race (all times EDT):

11:25 p.m.

A day before his highly-awaited speech on immigration, Donald Trump is accusing people in the country illegally of taking minority workers' jobs.

Trump tells a rally crowd in Washington state that refugees and people living in the U.S. illegally "take jobs from hardworking African-Americans and Hispanic citizens."

The GOP nominee also says he's going to stop the flow of drugs across the southern border. He says he'll address the issue in Wednesday's speech.

Trump said on Twitter earlier Tuesday that he would meet with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Wednesday.

Donald Trump is railing against the Democratic Party, calling it the party of slavery and Jim Crow.

The GOP presidential nominee says his party is the party of freedom, equality and opportunity.

Trump is continuing his efforts to appeal to minority voters at a Tuesday night rally in Everett, Washington, just north of Seattle, where he has drawn a largely white crowd.

He claims that Democrats have "used" minority voters for "decades and decades" and will continue to use them.

He says he "will fight for you like no one ever has before."

Donald Trump will make a surprise trip to Mexico on Wednesday to meet with the country's president hours before delivering a highly-anticipated speech on immigration.

Trump says on Twitter that he looks "very much forward" to meeting with President Enrique Pena Nieto. The Mexican leader had invited both Trump and Hillary Clinton to visit Mexico.

Pena Nieto's office says in its own tweet that the two men will meet in private Wednesday.

Trump has made illegal immigration and his call for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border a centerpiece of his presidential campaign. Pena Nieto has been sharply critical of Trump's insistence that Mexico would pay for a border wall.

Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence is back in North Carolina, attacking Democrat Hillary Clinton in a battleground state.

The Indiana governor lashed out at Clinton at a campaign rally in Winston-Salem Tuesday over her email controversies, the attack on the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi and her dealings with donors to the Clinton Foundation, all while she was secretary of state.

Pence also criticized President Barack Obama, saying the country's influence in the world has weakened under his and Clinton's leadership. Pence also reminded supporters that the composition of the Supreme Court could hinge on the election's outcome.

Pence was in Charlotte last week as both parties are heavily contesting a state that Obama won in 2008 and lost four years later.

Hillary Clinton is wrapping up a three-day fundraising blitz in the Hamptons.

The Democratic presidential nominee hopped from mansion to mansion in the tony New York oceanfront destination, appearing at lunches and dinners where the contributions ranged from $1,000 to $100,000 for guests and hosts. The top-dollar tour was set to conclude Tuesday night with an event in Sag Harbor complete with performances from Jimmy Buffett and Jon Bon Jovi.

The events all raised money for the Hillary Victory Fund, a joint fund supporting her campaign, the Democratic National Committee and state party organizations.

The union that represents stage actors and stage managers has endorsed Hillary Clinton for president.

The National Council of Actors Equity Association said in a news release Tuesday that this was the first time in the union's 103-year history that it has backed a political candidate. The union voted to endorse the Democratic candidate at a meeting in August, choosing Clinton over Republican nominee Donald Trump.

Equity President Kate Shindle said in a statement that the union typically remains nonpartisan, but "at such a critical time in our country's history, this union does not have that luxury if we hope to protect our members. We have to fight with everything we have for our survival."

The Actors Equity Association represents more than 50,000 professional actors and stage managers.

Four leading House Democrats want the FBI to investigate whether Donald Trump's presidential campaign was involved in the recent hack of Democratic Party computers.

The lawmakers wrote Tuesday to FBI Director James Comey that his agency should examine whether the Republican candidate's campaign and Russia conducted cyber attacks "to interfere with the U.S. presidential election."

The letter notes connections between Russia and Trump aides including former campaign manager Paul Manafort. He resigned following revelations of past work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. Some experts believe Russia was behind the hack of the Democratic National Committee that led tothe release of thousands of Democratic documents.

Writing Comey were Democratic Reps. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, Elliot Engel of New York and Bennie Thompson of Mississippi.

A conservative legal group has submitted 25 written questions to Hillary Clinton about her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state.

Judicial Watch submitted the questions to the Democratic presidential nominee on Tuesday following an order issued this month by U.S. District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan.

Judicial Watch has filed several lawsuits seeking government records related to Clinton. Sullivan's order was only a partial victory for the group, which had sought to depose Clinton in person.

It was not immediately clear from the wording of Sullivan's order whether Clinton must answer the questions under oath before or after the November election. Judicial Watch contends the deadline is Sept. 29. Clinton lawyer David Kendall did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The White House says President Barack Obama's national security advisers are discussing whether to designate state election systems as "critical infrastructure."

Spokesman Josh Earnest says such a designation would make federal resources available to help states secure those systems.

He offered no timetable on when a decision would be made.

The FBI has warned state officials to boost election security in light of evidence that hackers had targeted related data systems in two states the agency has not identified.

Federal officials are concerned that hackers, particularly those working for Russia or another country, could breach U.S. elections systems and wreak havoc on the November elections.

Earnest says the decentralized nature of the U.S. election system makes it harder to manipulate the outcome.

Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine is describing Donald Trump's campaign as a con job, saying the Republican nominee has "utterly failed" to answer basic questions about his finances and background.

Speaking in Erie, Pennsylvania, Kaine ticked through a list of areas in which he says Trump is being too secretive. Those areas include his finances, foreign ties, taxes and even his health.

Kaine questioned his business ties to Russia, suggesting Trump would not prevent Russia from invading American allies. Trump has been critical of the NATO alliance.

And Kaine is pushing back against Trump's allegations that Hillary Clinton is in poor health. He told the crowd he can barely keep up with the Democratic nominee on the campaign trail, adding "Hillary Clinton is one tough and one healthy person."

The State Department says about 30 emails involving the 2012 attack on U.S. compounds in Benghazi, Libya, are among the thousands of Hillary Clinton emails recovered during the FBI's recently closed investigation into the former secretary's use of a private server.

Government lawyers told U.S. District Court Judge Amit P. Mehta Tuesday that an undetermined number of the emails among the 30 were not included in the 55,000 pages previously provided by Clinton to State. The agency said it would need until the end of September to review the emails and redact potentially classified information before they are released.

The hearing was held in one of several lawsuits filed by the conservative legal group Judicial Watch, which is seeking government records involving the Democratic presidential nominee.

A trio of House Democrats is calling on congressional Republicans to denounce what they called "hateful rhetoric" by Donald Trump.

Pointing to the role that strong language can play in politics, U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn said Tuesday during a press call organized by the Hillary Clinton campaign that House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should "stand up and disavow the kind of hateful rhetoric that we're hearing from Donald Trump, the Republican nominee."

Clyburn also said a tweet by a black Trump supporter showing Clinton in black face "went beyond the pale."

Clyburn was referencing Pastor Mark Burns' posting earlier this week implying Clinton is pandering to black voters. The South Carolina pastor has since apologized for the tweet and said he should have used "better judgment."

If Trump is serious about courting black voters, Clyburn said, he shouldn't turn down invitations to speak to groups like the NAACP.

"You don't go to a 99 percent white audience and talk about us and call that an invitation to us," the South Carolina Democrat said.

11:45 a.m.

The FBI is expected to release documents soon related to its investigation into Hillary Clinton and her use of a private email server.

A law enforcement official said Tuesday that documents in the case would be made public as the FBI responds to Freedom of Information Act requests.

It wasn't immediately clear when the documents would be released or exactly what they would include. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The FBI this month provided Congress portions of its file from the agency's yearlong investigation into whether then-Secretary of State Clinton and her top aides mishandled classified information that flowed through a private email server.

CNN reported that the records could be made public as early as Wednesday.

Donald Trump and his aides used to say that voters didn't care about the nitty-gritty of policy details. But now those details are tripping up his campaign.

Trump has appeared to wrestle with his controversial pledge to expel everyone living in the U.S. illegally with the help of a "deportation force."

The GOP nominee polled an audience last week on the fate of an estimated 11 million people. It was a stunning display of indecision from a candidate who has asked voters to put enormous faith in his gut instincts.

Trump is now planning a major speech on immigration Wednesday. Supporters are hoping for a strong, decisive showing. But the episode underscores how little time his campaign has invested in outlining how he would accomplish his goals as president.
