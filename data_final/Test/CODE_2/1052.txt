Sanders to Big Soda: Cease and desist

With help from Helena Bottemiller Evich, Jenny Hopkinson, Ian Kullgren and Jason Huffman

SANDERS TO BIG SODA: CEASE AND DESIST: Sen. Bernie Sanders is so peeved that the American Beverage Association is using his likeness in anti-soda tax ads that are flooding the Bay Area media market that he’s sent the organization a cease-and-desist letter. The letter, confirmed by his office, takes issue with ABA’s use of the independent Vermont senator’s image, photo, likeness and words, reports Pro Ag’s Helena Bottemiller Evich.

For weeks, the beverage industry has been trying to capitalize on Sanders' public opposition to the Philadelphia soda tax — a position he took during the bitter Democratic primary in Pennsylvania last spring, to differentiate himself from Hillary Clinton, who had endorsed the tax. His comments have since been printed on glossy mailers, blared on TV and broadcast over social media in the Bay Area — where San Francisco, Oakland and the city of Albany have soda-tax measures on the ballot next month — and he's also been featured in the industry's anti-tax efforts in Boulder, Colo, the fourth city with such a ballot initiative.

"Advertising from the American Beverage Association that implies that I oppose ballot items in San Francisco and Oakland that would place a tax on drinks with sugar are false," Sanders said in a statement. “I have not taken any position on those ballot items, and I have asked the American Beverage Association to stop using my name in connection with this misleading advertising."

The ABA was unapologetic, saying in a statement that it’s common for a public figure to be used in political advertising, and that Sanders has used the same approach. "The fact is these taxes are regressive,” the ABA said. “They would disproportionately affect low-income and middle-class Americans. The senator has publicly opposed such taxes on the grounds that they would hurt low-income families.” Read the full story from Bottemiller Evich here.

CLINTON WALKED FINE LINE ON GMO LABELING: Hillary Clinton suggested to donors at a closed-door fundraiser in Boulder, Colo., last year that she was sympathetic to GMO labeling advocates’ push for mandatory state labeling laws. But she was careful not to draw the ire of Big Ag, saying she favors voluntary labeling at the federal level and appreciates the benefits of biotechnology, according to a transcript of her remarks included in hacked emails released by WikiLeaks on Thursday.

Clinton called the voluntary labeling that food companies and ag industry groups wanted a “first step” in getting consumers the information they are demanding. She agreed with industry that “a lot of that all should be put, in my view, online, in bar codes, so that people can find that information out.” But she stuck to her opposition to GMO labeling legislation that would preempt state laws — an industry priority that was included in the Roberts-Stabenow bill that eventually became law.

At the same time, Clinton was careful not to alienate biotech companies: "I'll put on a hat that I don't wear, which is a hat of the agricultural interests, and they will say, 'We have developed drought-resistant seed. It would be a lifesaver. It would create produce and grains that could be grown in Africa.’ ... So this whole issue, there are some equities on the other side that we have to sort through as well.” The transcript, sent to campaign chairman John Podesta's private Gmail account in December 2015, doesn't specify when the remarks were made. Around that time, Clinton and Sanders were in the thick of their struggle for the Democratic nomination, and Clinton was seeking to endear herself to the progressive left in Colorado and other swing states.

AG SECRETARY CLYBURN? OR MURANO? We can only imagine what agricultural policy would have looked like if it had not been Tom Vilsack helming USDA for the last eight years but instead Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) or Elsa Murano, the former USDA under secretary for food safety. Both were mentioned in connection with the ag sec post on lists of potential diversity and female candidates for Cabinet positions that were emailed in October 2008 to then-Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, one of the latest hacked emails splashed by WikiLeaks reveals.

The lists were sent by Michael Froman, now the U.S. trade representative; back then he was a Citigroup executive serving on Obama’s transition team. Clyburn has served in the House since 1993. The Cuban-born Murano, in addition to her USDA stint, was dean of Texas A&M University’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences before serving briefly as A&M’s president. The documents give a rare view into the timing and considerations made during the Cabinet selection process — an undertaking going on in earnest in the Clinton and Trump camps with less than three weeks before Election Day.

THAT MATTRESS … IS IT REALLY ORGANIC? The Organic Trade Association’s push to get the Federal Trade Commission and USDA to exercise greater oversight of non-agricultural products labeled as organic is an uphill battle. The industry group argues that the lack of regulation over the marketing of items like mattresses, dry cleaning services and personal care products is hurting the credibility of USDA's strict certification program. Specifically, OTA wants FTC to issue guidance that calls for organic claims on non-agricultural products only on the back of packaging. If such a claim is made on the front, it should be transparent and backed by a certification recognized by USDA’s program and subject to government oversight, Angela Jagiello, OTA associate director, told a roundtable of industry, advocacy group and government representatives on Thursday.

While the FTC is considering crafting guidance on the issue, the agency is not in the business of setting standards, responded Laura Koss, a senior attorney with the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection and a member of the panel. At most, the commission will put out guidance to inform product makers what consumers think organic label claims mean, Koss said. However, if the situation warrants it, "the FTC can take action against deceptive claims," she added.

PETERSON: AN EARLY FARM BILL MEANS MORE $: House Ag ranking member Collin Peterson thinks Congress will feel post-election pressure to do something about the farm economy, particularly because many producers won’t be able to obtain the financing they need this winter due to shrinking revenues from low commodity prices.

“I don’t know how bad it’s going to be, but some [farmers] have told me it’s going to be ugly come this winter,” he said in an interview with Minnesota radio station KLGR this week. “Rather than have some sort of short-term deal, if we need to make adjustments in the farm bill, we ought to do it for the long term.”

Lawmakers would have more money to work with for farm programs if they advance a farm bill next year instead of in 2018, due to how the Congressional Budget Office scores legislation, Peterson said. The dilemma dairy producers are confronting is another reason for earlier action, as the global milk surplus keeps prices suppressed. The margin protection insurance program created by the 2014 farm bill has low participation rates and needs improvement, he said. But House Ag Chairman Michael Conaway (R-Texas) isn't on the same page, and he sets the agenda, Peterson said, noting that the election will have bearing on how things play out.

It’s not going to be easy no matter when Congress acts, Peterson said, explaining that lawmakers from urban areas have “no clue” what it takes to farm and the amount of money needed to plant a crop each year. So even if the situation worsens, he isn’t convinced Congress will be swayed.

TESTER’S FARM BILL PANEL PONDERS ‘ROCKY’ TERRAIN: Also getting out early on farm bill negotiations were Sen. Jon Tester and a panel of Montana farmers and ranchers, who this week delved into an array of issues that need to be addressed by the next iteration, which is due by September 2018. Tester said, per local and regional media reports, that it will be difficult to advance the more expensive programs, like crop insurance and conservation, and advised agricultural producers to prepare for a rocky debate.

“There’s a lot of pressure out there to do away with subsidies, and there’s a lot of pressure to make sure we’re not giving subsidies to the wrong people,” Tester (D-Mont.) told The Billings Gazette. “It’s going to take some time, to have those debates to make sure that it actually provides a safety net, nobody’s getting rich off it, and it supports farmers down the road.”

Industry leaders at the meeting also generally supported raising the caps on direct and guaranteed operating loans and farm ownership loans administered by the USDA Farm Service Agency, similar to what would be accomplished by legislation that Sens. John Hoeven (R-N.D.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) introduced this summer, the Williston Herald (North Dakota) reported. The limit on direct loans would double, to $600,000, while the cap on guarantees would increase to $2.5 million, from $1.39 million — moves viewed as helpful for beginning farmers and ranchers, attendees said.

DEAR USDA, THANKS FOR FOLLOWING THE LAW: The National Association of Wheat Growers gave a big "thank you" late Thursday to the USDA for dropping its plan to do a study assessing whether consumers would use electronic GMO labels, which the group and others had argued was not part of the scope of the law signed by the president in July.

USDA on Wednesday issued a request for proposals to perform a nationwide study on a "legally defensible study to identify potential technological challenges that may impact whether consumers would have access to the bioengineering disclosure through electronic or digital disclosure methods.” But the department said it was scrapping its idea of doing the second study after the food and agriculture industries voiced concerns.

The winning firm will have until May 30, 2017 to complete its study, which will examine obstacles facing retailers and consumers, including those in rural and underserved areas. Since Congress has yet to put aside any money for the project, the department says in the notice that "the award is subject to the availability of funds.” More details here.

INT’L POULTRY WORKS ON ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE REPORT: The International Poultry Council plans to release a comprehensive report in coming months on antibiotic resistance, as part of its pledge to help minimize the development and transfer of drug-resistant bacteria, the council announced Thursday. The IPC — which has more than 20 “country members” (poultry orgs representing the industry in their respective countries) — discussed at its conference in Portugal last week how it’s important for the poultry industry to maintain access to antibiotics, but also ensure they are used responsibly, under veterinary supervision and only when necessary, said the council’s president, Jim Sumner, who also is president of the USA Poultry & Egg Export Council.

“The IPC is strongly committed to be more fully engaged on this issue,” said IPC Secretary General Marilia Rangel Campos. “We have a strong core of dedicated members who will continue to review the related research and global concerns on the issue in order to develop a document that contains specific recommendations on a path forward for the global poultry industry.”
