BEIRUT, Lebanon — They are getting used to fewer explosions, and to fewer ambulances racing through their war-ravaged cities. Now, under a tentative cease-fire across Syria, people have more time to think about longer-term concerns.

We’ve been keeping in touch with Syrians from all over the country since the truce took effect Monday night. They’re sharing their thoughts, experiences, videos and photos — and their doubts.

President Bashar al-Assad’s supporters and opponents alike share a sense of misgiving. They know the cease-fire was negotiated between Russia and the United States, over their heads. They do not know its details, and they do not know if anyone — the world powers or their own putative leaders, whether the opposition or the government — has their interests in mind.

As the Syrian government held up promised United Nations aid for a third day, fighters and civilians in rebel-held Aleppo called the aid a poisoned chalice that legitimized Mr. Assad’s siege tactics.

There are also skeptics in government-held areas, some who favor Mr. Assad and some who don’t. In many such places, the cease-fire has a smaller upside: The residents have not been living under airstrikes, because the rebels lack planes.

“I hope this cease-fire is real, and not a chance for the armed groups to rearm,” said a police officer in a government-held Christian village near Homs.

Doubts persist even in the areas that have suffered most from rebel shelling: on the western side of Aleppo and in two Shiite villages in Idlib Province, islands of government-held territory besieged by rebels. They worry that Mr. Assad and his allies — Iran, Russia and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah — are too busy with war to make helping them a priority.

Hussein Halaq, 35, a computer technician, lives with his wife and three children in Fouaa, one of those encircled Shiite villages. He said the biggest danger was Qaeda-linked fighters in neighboring Binnish.

Unfortunately, nobody dares to say, “I take responsibility for Fouaa.” Until today, we don’t know who can help. Everybody is running away from the responsibility. The Syrians are saying it’s the Lebanese, and the Lebanese are saying it’s the Iranians. The first day of the cease-fire, they bombed us with gas jars stuffed with explosives. My wife and children might be shot by a sniper any time from Binnish, even though we put up curtains and cinder blocks as protection. We have two food options: either bulgur wheat or rice and lentils. I still have five kilos of rice in my house. If they run out, I can’t afford more. Meat is rare and expensive.

We spoke by phone to a lawyer who supports Mr. Assad and lives in the western, government-held section of Aleppo, and who was concerned about the presence of fighters from the Qaeda-backed Nusra Front, recently renamed the Levant Conquest Front. He asked not to be identified because he was not authorized by the government to speak to reporters.

People in Aleppo are not very comfortable with the cease-fire agreement. There is some mystery, and the terms are not so clear. After the army recaptured Ramouseh and Castello, people in West Aleppo became convinced that East Aleppo would be rejoined to the west. But they lost this hope. With this agreement, the red lines in the city were defined for good. Also, the terms about the Nusra Front are so unclear. What does it mean, hitting Nusra and not other groups? A Nusra fighter can easily join other groups. You cannot control this provision.

Facebook Live Interview with Syrian Activist

Yusuf al-Ali, 50, a hospital worker, lives in his brother-in-law’s apartment in central Damascus with his wife, a teacher, and their three children. They fled their home in Yarmouk, a Palestinian refugee camp, in December 2012 after rebels infiltrated and the government started airstrikes; the brother-in-law fled to Germany. Mr. Ali spoke in a coffee shop near his home.

I don’t trust all these political talks and cease-fire deals. One thing that will be a real sign of a real truce in Syria is the return of all displaced Syrians to their homes. The regime cannot retake all of Syria, and the opposition also cannot knock down the regime in Damascus. Russia and the United States are not too interested in the Syrian war. Syrians have no say at all. We lost our role in ending the war. Russia defends its interests in Syria, but Iran is going to fight to the end to keep President Assad in his position. Iran considers its war in Syria as a life-and-death battle. There are fewer bombs, but still not that many people in the streets. Maybe the regime wants to give the impression that everything is doing well and Syrians are living normally as in the past, but this is not true. Syrians are tired of war, but they know that they will not get back to their old days.

Firas Alsaid, 28, was also nervous, wondering how long the calm would last. He lives in the rebel-held town of Talbiseh in the central province of Homs. He has not left the town, which has been hit by frequent airstrikes, since the revolt began, and he finds the quiet almost eerie.
