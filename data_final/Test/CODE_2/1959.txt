If you've got it, flaunt it is a saying that this hitmaker may have heard a few times.

Justin Bieber was doing just that as he enjoyed a shirtless hike in the hills above Los Angeles on Saturday.

The 22-year-old showed off his impressive physique as he pulled off his shirt to reveal a muscular chest and arms covered with various tattoos.

If you've got it...: Justin Bieber flaunted his impressive physique during a hike in LA on Saturday

He flexed his biceps just wrestling with the charcoal-grey garment that ended up in a bunch around his hands at one point.

He wore a pair of light grey cargo shorts with the white waistband of his Calvin Klein's showing.

Justin smiled a little as though he were hearing a wave of applause.

Off with the shirt: The 22-year-old hitmaker pulled off his shirt to reveal his assorted tattoo collection along with his muscly torso

Thanks a bunch: The imaginary applause could be heard as bare-chested Justin traversed the steep incline

The What Do You Mean crooner wore no shades and was seen squinting in the glare as he made his way back to level land.

His short-cropped hair looked even lighter in the California sunshine.

Clearly Justin's workouts have paid off as he traversed the steep incline with no apparent trouble at all.

Me and my Calvins: Justin wore grey cargo shorts that showed the waistband of his Calvins

Great outdoors: This is the second time this week that Justin decided to hit the hills for a rigorous workout

On Tuesday, Justin did a good deed by taking his little sister Jazmyn Bieber shopping at American Girl doll store at The Grove in Los Angeles.

Justin's sibling made out like a bandit by the looks of things - she emerged carrying a doll and Justin's bodyguard bore a bag filled with more purchases.

Meanwhile, Justin's romance with Sofia Richie seems to have cooled following a weekend trip to Los Cabos last week.

Cool down: Justin worked up a good sweat and obviously felt the clothing was in the way

He did it: The Baby crooner had a satisfied smile on his face as he neared the end of the trail

She was spotted out and about with her famous crooner father Lionel Richie on Friday.

On Thursday, while Justin went club-hopping with friends, Sofia went out to dinner with a mystery man.

Justin was seen getting flirty with model Bronte Blampied in London recently/

And then on Tuesday night he was apparently exchanging digits with a beautiful brunette outside of Villa nightclub in Los Angeles.
