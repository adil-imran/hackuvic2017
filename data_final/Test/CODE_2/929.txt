Canada's top banking watchdog said it would require mortgage insurers to hold bigger capital cushions for home loans taken out when housing markets are particularly frothy, the latest in a series of measures aimed at easing risks posed by soaring house prices in two of the country's biggest markets.

The new mortgage-insurance rules, expected to come into force starting in January, were unveiled by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions on Friday in a draft version issued for public consultation.

"When house prices are high relative to borrower incomes, the new framework will require that more capital be set aside," the regulator's superintendent, Jeremy Rudin, said in a release. "Ultimately this will continue to provide a level of protection to both policyholders and unsecured creditors."

Canadian officials have been implementing measures, and considering further intervention, to mitigate the risk posed by rapid house-price gains and the rise of household debt to record levels. Canada's central bank has identified elevated levels of consumer debt and housing-market imbalances as key vulnerabilities to financial stability.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau recently named a panel to consider new measures to ensure housing affordability amid skyrocketing gains in Vancouver and Toronto, where house prices rose 31% and 17%, respectively, in August from a year earlier. That panel is expected to report later this fall, and Mr. Morneau hasn't ruled out more measures to address the issue.

Among the steps taken, the Canadian government in February began requiring higher down payments on homes sold for more than 500,000 Canadian dollars ($382,790). Last month, the province of British Columbia introduced a 15% tax for foreigners buying homes in Vancouver. The government said the tax was aimed at keeping home prices more affordable for local residents.

The banking regulator said current capital requirements for mortgage insurance risk were first developed in the early 1990s and haven't been updated for almost 15 years. The new measures are aimed at ensuring that "mortgage insurance companies can absorb severe but plausible losses," the regulator said.

It said the new rules will require an additional capital stipulation for mortgages that are taken out during periods when the house price-to-income ratio for a given regional housing market is above a certain threshold.

Genworth MI Canada Inc., the country's second-biggest mortgage insurer, said in a statement Friday that capital requirements for certain of its loan-to-value categories may increase, "and this could lead to a corresponding increase in premium rates." The company said it has C$175 million in cash on hand and access to a C$100 million undrawn line of credit, and could draw on these reserves to help meet new capital requirements.

Genworth's stock fell after the regulator's announcement and was recently down 4.6% on the Toronto Stock Exchange at C$33.18.

A spokeswoman for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., the government-owned mortgage insurer and the dominant player in the market, said the agency supports efforts "that better position mortgage insurers to withstand severe economic challenges."

Canada Guaranty Mortgage Insurance Co., the country's third main mortgage-insurance provider, didn't respond to a request for comment.

The changes unveiled by the banking watchdog come after the Bank of Canada expressed concern earlier this year about the number of high loan-to-income mortgages in some markets. Data from the central bank suggest the number of mortgages issued last year with a loan-to-income ratio above 450% rose "notably" from the previous year, reaching 15% from 12%.
