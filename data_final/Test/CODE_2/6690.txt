Amid the failures hurting the Samajwadi Party government in Uttar Pradesh, this one has pride involved, literally. Mulayam Singh Yadav brought it up in Parliament last week, demanding a probe into the death of two lions brought from Gujarat for his dream project, the Etawah Lion Safari.

“My lions have died. Modiji [Narendra Modi, then Gujarat chief minister] had gifted them to us. I want an inquiry. How did they die?” Mulayam said.

Nine lions have died so far — these include stillbirths. The last death, on June 2. was of a lion brought from Gujarat.

With months to go for the assembly elections, the planned safari’s seven remaining lions and lionesses look increasingly desolate on a 350-hectare arid, hot stretch of Etawah, bare of any big tree. One of those lionesses, Kunwari, is ailing from canine distemper virus, the same disease which killed Kuber on June 2 and which is believed to have felled at least three other lions.

Of nine lions from Gujarat’s Gir, brought from Rajkot and Junagadh zoos in September 2014, four are now dead. Two others, brought from Hyderabad zoo, died in October and November 2014. Besides, five cubs were either stillborn or died soon after birth.

Now the BJP has been questioning the project itself. During the 2014 election campaign, Modi had observed that UP “hadn’t been able to control the lions” from Gujarat.

Mulayam first expressed his desire for a safari in his home district as chief minister in 2003-07, allotting Rs 5 crore. Chambal region was described as similar to Gir in temperature, humidity and vegetation. Mayawati came in 2007 and put that in cold storage, till Akhilesh dusted and brought the idea back on the table in 2012.

The plan was to develop 50 hectares along Fisher forest on the Etawah-Gwalior highway as the lion safari, surrounded by another 300 hectares of forest buffer. The Ministry of Environment and Forests initially did not clear the plan. When it got the clearance, the government first set up an Asiatic lion breeding centre with the lions from zoos in Hyderabad, Junagadh and Rajkot. The breeding centre was to have at least 10 lions before they could be shifted to the safari and it could be opened to the public.

Till last year, the government had spent Rs 53 crore, including on the breeding centre and various other facilities. The cost is now likely to rise, with the government creating a corpus fund of Rs 100 crore for the safari’s maintenance. As much as Rs 1 lakh is spent monthly on the upkeep of a pair of lions.

Lioness Laxmi and lion Vishnu, brought from Hyderabad zoo in 2013, died the following year, their death attributed to CDV. The death of at least one of the cubs was caused by the same virus.

Stung by the deaths, the government has been moving around officers. After the death of newborn cubs in July and August last year, the government removed then director, Lion Safari, K K Singh and chief wildlife warden Rupak De. The CM himself had been keeping a tab on the birth and survival of the cubs, and had parked De at the spot.

S K Upadhyaya was appointed the new Chief Wildlife Warden. On December 28, after three more lions were brought from Gujarat and one of them, Tapasya, fell ill and died of tick-borne babesiosis disease on January 9, Upadhyaya too was removed and De reappointed.

On May 31, two days before Kuber’s death, De was removed again, although he was asked to continue to oversee safari work until further arrangements. The charge of chief wildlife warden has now been given to Umendra Sharma.

“There is no vaccine if CDV (canine distemper vaccine) affects lions. Its vaccine is available for dogs but not cats. There is little we can do once a lion is infected by CDV,” said Prof R P Pandey, head of veterinary surgery at Mathura-based UP Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Veterinary University and Cow Research Centre, who helped in the treatment of the infected lions. “Lions have died of CDV in other places too.”

Last week, sources said, principal secretary, forests, Sanjeev Saran visited the safari and shared with officials “findings” of a report he had prepared. “He said a majority of big cats across the world die due to canine distemper. He shared some references of South Africa’s Serengeti, where some 1,000 lions died within a year,” said an official.

To guard against infection, the lions are now being given RO-purified water and their meat is being tested for contamination. The temperature of their cages is being maintained. The area where the lions are kept is under CCTV.

The authorities recently carried out a vaccination drive among stray and domestic dogs in villages around the safari. Mongoose and other animals that carry the virus were trapped and taken away. A team of veterinarians from the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Veterinary University and Cow Research Centre, wildlife scientists from the Bareilly-based Indian Veterinary Research Institute, as well as veterinarians from Gujarat, Karnataka and Uttarakhand have been roped in to check the lion deaths. Experts in the UK and Botswana have also been consulted.

“Everyone must understand it is not something for which we can fix a deadline. CDV is an air-borne virus and it is very difficult to control it,” said Sanjay Srivastava, the second director of the lion safari.

Also objecting to the figure of “nine deaths”, Srivastava said, “Three were stillbirths and another cub failed to survive the initial period. Such projects require time and patience.”

Deputy director Anil Patel said all possible measures are being taken to keep the big cats fit and fine, including planting saplings so as to give the area a forest cover. “It will take around five to six years for the saplings to turn into trees,” he said.

For now, all eyes are on the four lionesses at the safari (Heer, Kunwari, Girishma and Jessica), with the hope that they will give birth to cubs. The remaining lions are Manan, Gigo and Pataudi. Kunwari is also reported to be CDV-infected. Last month, the Safari administration started the process to get the lions vaccinated against the CDV. Earlier this year, they had undertaken a drive to vaccinate all the dogs in surrounding area to stop them from passing on the virus.

But, again, officials caution, little is in their hands. “These are lions, not domestic animals. It is hard to find out if they are having babies unless there are clear symptoms. When we get any confirmation about it, everyone will come to know,” said an overwrought Srivastava.
