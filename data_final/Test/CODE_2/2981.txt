Distressed with overflowing open pit latrines, Hesbon Nyambare, a caretaker of 35 houses in the informal settlement of Kaptembwa in Nakuru county of Kenya, sought to find a solution.

"We are not connected to the sewer system and so everything spreads out when the latrines are full," Nyambare told Xinhua in a recent interview in Nakuru.

"You feel like running away anytime you pass near them because the smell is just suffocating and the flies are all over. You even lose appetite for food," he said.

But need for change pushed him to reconstruct the six latrines fitting them with a septic tank which serves as alternative to the sewer lines. It holds the waste which is removed when full with an exhauster.

"Since 2015 when I finished reconstructing the latrines life is much more comfortable here. My tenants are even happy. There is no defecating in the compound or bad smell," he said.

He says access to the sanitation and sewerage services to the people in the informal settlements remains to be a major challenge that requires urgent redress.

In Kenya, the government owned water, sanitation and sewerage companies are responsible for providing proper disposal and sewer services as well as treatment of the human waste before discharged into the environment.

For Nyambare and his tenants life may have improved with the customized sewerage system.

But for at least 17 million people living in the urban and peri-urban centres in Kenya their sanitation life is undignified due to lack of access to the sewerage services.

A Water Impact Report for 2015 released by Kenya's Water Services Regulatory Board (Wasreb) on Wednesday indicates that just about three million people out of 20 million living in areas within the reach of water service providers are connected to sewers.

The coverage is equivalent to 15 percent of the urban population.

The findings collaborate with UNICEF's which also show that by 2014 only 15 percent of the 9,126 villages in Kenya had been triggered to eradicate open defecation, which is a sanitation problem in the public health sector also connected to provision of the sewerage services.
