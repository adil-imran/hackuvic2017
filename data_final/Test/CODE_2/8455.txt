Despite Dhaka's strong protest at repeated interference in Bangladesh's internal affairs, Pakistan's National Assembly yesterday passed a unanimous resolution condemning the execution of war criminal and Jamaat-e-Islami leader Mir Quasem Ali.

The resolution moved by Sher Akbar Khan claimed the execution of Jamaat leaders is contrary to the tripartite agreement signed by Pakistan, India and Bangladesh in 1974.

On September 4, Bangladesh foreign ministry summoned acting high commissioner of Pakistan in Dhaka Samina Mehtab and handed over a strongly worded note verbale to the diplomat, protesting Pakistan foreign ministry's statement following the execution of Mir Quasem on September 3.

Pakistan's National Assembly demanded the government to seriously raise at all the international forums the sentencing of political opponents in Bangladesh.

The House adopted the resolution with Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq in the chair, according to a report of Radio Pakistan.

Pakistan had earlier issued similar statements and adopted resolutions in national parliament and provincial assembly after the execution of war criminals to which Bangladesh had reacted by summoning its high commissioners to the foreign office.

The Bangladesh government earlier made it clear that Pakistan has no scope for making any comments on the trial of war criminals in Bangladesh as the entire trials were open, transparent and there was scope for appeal. Like other executed Jamaat leaders, Mir Quasem availed the opportunity of appeal before the highest court.

The government said Mir Quasem was tried for specific crimes he committed during the Liberation War of Bangladesh.

On the tripartite agreement, Bangladesh foreign ministry's note verbale to the Pakistan envoy stated that in no way the 1974 agreement had given clemency to the Bangladeshi war criminals, including the members of Razakar, Al-Badr, and Al-Shams.

Even after the 1974 agreement and until the end of 1975, a large number of Bangladeshi war criminals were in different jails of Bangladesh facing trials, and Pakistan had never expressed its concerns by relating those trials with the 1974 agreement, the note said.

The Pakistani diplomat was reminded that Pakistan continues to present a misleading, limited and partial interpretation of the underlying premise of the 1974 agreement, which is unacceptable to Bangladesh.

The essential spirit of the agreement was to create an environment of good neighbourliness and peaceful co-existence and for ushering in long-term stability and shared prosperity in the region.

The “clemency” mentioned in the agreement never implied that the masterminds and perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide would continue to enjoy impunity and eschew the course of justice.

The tripartite agreement in no way restricted Bangladesh from prosecuting its own nationals for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity, the foreign ministry said.

The scope of the 1974 agreement was limited to repatriation of 195 Pakistani war criminals and remaining Pakistani prisoners of war, and the return of the Bangalees stranded inside Pakistan, the note verbale said.
