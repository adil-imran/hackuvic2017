Surveillance camera footage taken near the Zeer Rangsit shopping centre in Lam Luk Ka shows the suspected killer on his bicycle, and a police sketch of the suspect.

A homeless man originally from Myanmar is being held as a suspect in connection with the separate killings of three homeless people in Pathum Thani last week.

Police apprehended the 20-year-old suspect identified only as Bung or Jimmy in Chatuchak district of Bangkok on Friday evening. Traffic police from the Bang Sue station had spotted him sleeping on a median strip near the Mor Chit bus terminal on Kamphaeng Phet Road.

The officers found his appearance, clothing and bicycle matched a sketch and surveillance footage of a man wanted for three slayings in tambon Prachathipat of Thanyaburi district, Pathum Thani, between Tuesday and Thursday of this week.

Mr Bung ran away when officers approached him but was caught at 6.40pm in Phahon Yothin Soi 18/1. Police seized the bicycle and two mobile phones from him.

The suspect was taken to the Bang Sue police station where he admitted he was the man shown in the police handout but denied any involvement in the murders. He said he fled police because he had entered Thailand illegally and did not want to get caught.

Mr Bung said he had been in the neighbourhood where the killings took place for six days, trying to find a job and surviving by scavenging and begging. He had been arrested by Bang Sue police for illegal entry last month and was deported to Myanmar. He returned again late last month by travelling on foot through the Mae Sot-Myawaddy border checkpoint in Tak province. He claimed a Karen man in Tak gave him the bicycle, which he rode to Bangkok.

Police on Saturday took the handcuffed suspect to the scene of the crimes for a re-enactment, where Mr Bung told officers that he only talked to the victims but did not kill them.

Police had speculated earlier that the three victims may have been killed by the same person, who committed the crimes as a result of mental illness or hallucination caused by a narcotic. The victims are two men -- Supakorn Tokran and Satian Sornchai -- and a woman -- Supapan Kongyudee.

Forensic experts said Mr Bung had scratches on his body, and specks of blood barely visible to the naked eye were detected on his T-shirt after forensic experts conducted a test using a chemical solution. The suspect claimed he had used the T-shirt to wipe blood from a cut on his knee.

Pol Lt Gen Sanit Mahathavorn, chief of the Metropolitan Police Bureau, said on Saturday that Mr Bung denied involvement in the crimes and gave confusing statements during hours of overnight interrogation.

However, he believes Mr Bung was the killer as a six-year-old child saw him tie the first victim’s hands with electrical wire.

Although the witness was only six years old, Pol Lt Gen Sanit said, the hearsay carried sufficient weight. The child, whose gender was not disclosed, was allowed to give a statement to police in the presence of authorities responsible for children’s rights.

The suspect has also been identified by an adult witness, a 37-year-old transgender who saw Mr Bung near one of the crime scenes, Pol Lt Gen Sanit said. The witness told police that the suspect grabbed her hand and asked if he could have sex. Fearing for her safety, the witness fled.

Forensic police plan to check DNA samples collected from Mr Bung and his clothes to find out if they match genetic material found on the corpses or their clothes. The process would take one or two weeks, Pol Lt Gen Sanit said.

Investigators took Mr Bung to the Thanyaburi Provincial Court to request further detention. Investigators will also arrange for a psychiatrist to examine the suspect, the city police chief added.
