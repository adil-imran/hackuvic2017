Four years ago, Wahab and Sumon -- two convicted criminals -- met in jail and became friends.

One day, Sumon got released. When he was about to leave, Wahab requested him to tell his wife Razia to come and meet him at the Dhaka Central Jail gate or on the court premises on a particular date to try for his bail.

Sumon, however, did not pass on the message to Razia. Instead, he started to visit her frequently, and eventually developed an extramarital affair with her.

The relationship continued even after the husband got out of jail three years ago.

One day, Sumon, 35, secretly filmed some of the “intimate moments” with Razia by his mobile phone and sold the footage to a CD store.

Recently, Wahab, 36, came across the footage and identified his wife with Sumon.

Though maddened, Wahab decided not to harm Razia, 30. He instead took her aboard in planning how to take revenge on Sumon.

He hired goons and slit Sumon's throat in the capital's Kadamtoli area on October 25.

This might look like straight out of a dark, twisted movie, but this is what has happened in the capital, said police quoting confessions of the couple who has been arrested.

Police arrested Wahab from Sadarghat and Razia from Munshiganj yesterday, said Kazi Wazed Ali, officer-in-charge of Kadamtoli Police Station.

Razia, who had been blackmailed by Sumon into continuing the relationship, aided and abetted her husband, added the OC.

The two arrestees confessed to killing Sumon, a fish trader in Jatrabari area.

Police said Razia, as planned, called Sumon over phone and asked him to go to Kadamtoli area. As Sumon reached there, Wahab and his men, who were hiding there, killed him and dumped his body in Shympur Wasa sluice gate area.

Police recovered the body from the same area yesterday and caught the killers following investigation.

Sumon was jailed five years ago for torturing his wife while Wahab, who faces various cases including murder and robbery, was sent to jail some 12 years ago.
