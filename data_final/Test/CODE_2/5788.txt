The Acting Director- General of the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), Dr. Vincent Onome Akpotaire has urged the Electricity Distribution Companies ( DisCos) to improve on their servive delivery, so as to erase the general impression that the are not performing.

He challenged the owners of the successor companies of the defunct Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) to think outside the box and make long- term investments to improve their plants’ network and infrastructure despite the seeming unfavourable operating environment in the country.

He enjoined the investors to approach local and international funding sources to improve on their operations so that when the environment stabilises, they would not be caught napping since their investment is in perpetuity.

IBPE’s Head, Public Communications,. Alex E. Okoh, said in a statement yesterday that BPE’s Acting Director-General gave the advice during the flag- off of the agency’s periodic post privatisation monitoring exercise at the Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC) in Ibadan. He reminded the DisCos that they won the bid of their respective companies based on the Aggregate Technical Commercial and Collection (ATC&C) they submitted, saying they could only achieve if they consciously expand and improve their network operation “because if the network is not improved and metering not aggressively pursued, you cannot reduce technical and collection losses.”

Akpotaire pointed out that the impressive investments and progress the IBEDC has made, especially with the embedded generation project in collaboration with British America Tobacco (BAT), admonished that “it is still not enough because any investment you make is in perpetuity. You need to find answers to the liquidity challenge.

He informed owners of the IBEDC that the Vice President and Chairman of the National Council on Privatisation (NCP) , Professor Yemi Osinbajo and the Minister of Power, Works and Housing,Mr Babatunde Fashola, are working assiduously to ensure that the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) debts were paid as soon as possible and enjoined the power owners to work to improve power efficiency in view of the effort the government is making to get electric power to the people and to get them pay for it. He said the general impression was that the Discos were not performing.
