Over the weekend, that changed dramatically. By Saturday night, the list of Republican officeholders abandoning Trump was in the dozens and growing by the hour. Yet, it is a sign of how bitterly divided America remains that few if any of these Republicans are actually willing to advocate a vote for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. They claim Trump is unfit for office and must be stopped at any price — but add that they can never, ever vote for Clinton. John McCain’s pledge to write-in “the name of some good, conservative Republican who is qualified to be president” is a common ‘unendorser’ response.

That position is illogical at best and is arguably counter-productive. For better or worse, the American political system offers a binary choice. There are other candidates on the ballot — as many as seven or eight in some states — but none has a realistic chance of winning. In the 2012 presidential election, around 129 million votes were cast; 98.5 per cent of these were for either Barack Obama or Mitt Romney. One can argue that the US ought to have a system more open to candidates beyond the Democratic and Republican parties but, for now, it does not. So if one feels it is essential to keep Trump out of the White House, the only effective way to do that is to vote for Clinton. Writing in someone else or voting for a third party candidate may salve one’s partisan conscience, but it is at best a neutral gesture and in a genuinely close election could be counterproductive (and obviously the reverse also holds true: If one truly believes Clinton represents an existential threat to the Republic the way to block that is to vote for Trump, not to vote for the Libertarian or write-in Bernie Sanders). Eye-popping statements These Republicans are trying to have it both ways. They are desperately seeking a form of words that allows them to denounce Trump without alienating his still-substantial base of supporters. As is often the case with Trump, there were a lot of eye-popping statements to unpack on the morning after the debate. That may, briefly, shift attention away from the 2005 tape, but the damage it has done should not be underestimated. Few, if any, of the Republicans who turned on Trump over the weekend will now embrace him. Indeed, they can’t: Two such reversals in a matter of days would call any politician’s judgement into question. Attitudes about sexual assault have shifted dramatically in America over the last few years and Trump’s attempts to brush aside his remarks are unlikely to convince very many of those who were shocked when they first heard the recording. The GOP exodus from Trump indicates that professional politicians, who tend to have an innate sense of which way the tide is flowing, are coming to believe that the damage is irreversible. Yet, their collective unwillingness to endorse Clinton, even reluctantly, is a reminder that among Republicans, she is almost as reviled a figure as Trump has become for Democrats. It is also a reminder that if Clinton wins, the world will have been spared of President Trump, but at the price of continuing Washington’s era of partisan trench warfare. — Gordon Robison, a longtime Middle East journalist and US political analyst, teaches Political Science at the University of Vermont Agreement Poll Do you agree with this article?
