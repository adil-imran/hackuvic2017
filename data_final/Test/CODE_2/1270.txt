It is a fact that it was announced in the end of 2014 but it could not have an effect in 2015 as initially it was done for 113 countries. Now, we have 150 countries.

According to data from hotel consulting and research firm HVS, the average rate for a Mumbai hotel increased three per cent in 2015 and is expected to grow 10 per cent in 2016. Occupancy could improve from 72 per cent in 2015 to 73 per cent this year. The occupancy level in Delhi, which saw sizeable addition in supplies as several new hotels came up in Aerocity, improved from 62 per cent in 2014 to 67 per cent in 2015. HVS expects occupancy to rise further to 72 per cent in 2016 and rates to go up by eight per cent. Other leading cities like Bengaluru and Hyderabad are also projected to see better occupancy.Tourists are a major source of foreign exchange earnings too. The ministry said foreign exchange earnings from tourism grew nearly 8 per cent to $14.92 billion in the first eight months this calendar year. The ministry compiles arrivals on the basis of data received from the Bureau of Immigration. The US, Bangladesh and the UK are the top three source countries accounting for about 40 per cent of arrivals. Forex earning is compiled on the basis of data available with the Reserve Bank of India.
