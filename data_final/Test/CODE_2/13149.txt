The airline has been in talks with one of the major Gulf carriers aimed at securing a cash injection in the region of $2-million (about R28-million) in return for equity.

In addition to the money, Fly Blue Crane would have benefited from partnership links with the international Gulf airline.

But the talks have stalled and industry insiders with knowledge of the proposed deal said problems began when Fly Blue Crane engaged with the Industrial Development Corporation in search of funding.

Complicating the issue was the fact that Fly Blue Crane is in competition with SA Express, a state-owned entity like the IDC.

Last week cash-strapped SA Express announced it was suspending its Johannesburg flights to and from East London and Port Elizabeth, as well as its Cape Town-Durban service.

Fly Blue Crane's strategy is focused on providing affordable daily flights, for passengers and cargo, to less-travelled domestic and regional destinations.

Previously such routes were served only by Airlink and SA Express and the lack of low-cost competition often led to high fares.

Before Fly Blue Crane's arrival on the scene, it was difficult, for example, to fly one-way between Mthatha and Johannesburg for less than R3000.

The IDC approved bridging finance of R30-million for Fly Blue Crane in April, far less than the R240-million that the airline had requested.

A source with knowledge of the terms of the deal said one of the loan conditions was that Fly Blue Crane would not "negatively impact" state-owned carriers.

The owner and CEO of Fly Blue Crane, Siza Mzimela, declined to discuss the airline's funding woes in detail but confirmed that the IDC had approved R30-million in bridging finance, and that it was staggered over four payments.

"The initial request to the IDC was for R240-million, which would have been adequate," Mzimela said.

"A formal application was made to the IDC ... followed by a due diligence of the company before the funds were approved," she said.

Mzimela said the bridging finance was "encouraging", but "the government, through its various infrastructure development funds, can play a bigger role in supporting new entrants beyond just start-up capital".

IDC spokesman Mandla Mpangase said the bridging facility had been approved to enable Fly Blue Crane to conclude its negotiations with the strategic equity partner, "which was critical for the sustainability of the company in view of high barriers to entry".

The structuring of the IDC bridging loan was the problem hampering the negotiations between Fly Blue Crane and the Gulf carrier

He added: "The nature of the airline business, as you will know, is capital intensive and our support for Fly Blue Crane is based on the company's business approach, focusing on appropriate markets."

Mpangase said the promotion of regional integration was a key consideration; the IDC wanted to support the movement of goods, services and skills in parts of Southern Africa not served by established carriers.

However, several people with intimate knowledge of the discussions between Fly Blue Crane and the IDC said the requirements and conditions of the agreement for the R30-million funding had become a liability for Fly Blue Crane.

One insider said the IDC was imposing the same terms and conditions on the R30-million bridging loan as it would have demanded for the original R240-million application.

"Even this [R30-million] was split into payments of R7.5-million, while the airline required between R10-million and R15-million a month to operate."

The structuring of the IDC bridging loan was the problem hampering the negotiations between Fly Blue Crane and the Gulf carrier, the insiders said.

"These guys [the IDC] were behaving as if they were a shareholder, even demanding to meet the potential strategic partner," one insider said.

"This was confusing to them [the Gulf airline] because the IDC is nowhere in the documentation shown as equity owners ... That level of interference was shocking to them and they were uncomfortable."

Among the benefits of a tie-in with a major strategic partner would be that Fly Blue Crane could add regional destinations such as Maputo, Lusaka and Harare, as well as increase flight frequency to existing domestic destinations as the December holiday season approached.
