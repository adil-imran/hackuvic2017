The chief spokesman for Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s prime minister, said Monday that his boss will not ease up his criticism of the EU, despite pointed calls for greater unity by senior leaders including European Council President Donald Tusk, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

“Why should we?” the spokesman, Zoltán Kovács, said in an interview after a briefing at the Hungarian mission to the EU in Brussels. “Has the Commission started to act conciliatory?”

The remarks by Kovács underscore how senior EU leaders have failed to quell the internal discord that they fear is contributing to deepening Euroskepticism and public mistrust of European institutions across the Continent, particularly after Britain’s vote to leave the bloc.

An informal summit in Bratislava Friday was intended to build cohesion and trust among the 27 EU leaders. But while they reached an agreement on a tightly-focused agenda for the next several months, Orbán before leaving the event had reiterated his sharp criticism of EU immigration policy.

The briefing by Kovács was focused on an October 2 public referendum in which Hungarian voters are widely expected to reject the EU’s plan for mandatory relocation of refugees across Europe under a quota system. Hungary has already filed a lawsuit against the planned quota system in the European Court of Justice.

Hungary’s approach to the migrant crisis, including plans to build a second border fence, has drawn scathing criticism from some EU leaders — criticism that Kovács said was unfair and unjustified.

Last week, Luxembourg’s foreign affairs minister, Jean Asselborn, said that Hungary should be kicked out of the EU because it had treated migrants almost like “wild animals” including by building a border fence. Xavier Bettel, the prime minister of Luxembourg, later disavowed the comment, saying it did not represent the country’s official position.

In a lengthy and impassioned defense of Hungary’s anti-establishment perspective, Kovács said that Hungary was accustomed to such attacks.

“We have always been, you know, called anti-European or non-European or threatened with being expelled from the community, but that’s nonsense,” Kovács said, listing actions taken by Hungary that had prompted criticism, including the adoption of a new media law, enactment of a new constitution, and the implementation of an economic reform plan.

“When are you going to stop that argumentation, that’s my first question,” Kovács said. “Wouldn’t it be time to listen to Central European countries, including Hungary?”

At the briefing, he also said that Hungary had lost its trust in senior EU officials and would not believe any assertions of a change in migrant policy until formal action is taken. During the summer, and in a speech last week in the European Parliament, Juncker hinted at possible changes in migration policy, where member states could express solidarity in other forms rather than simply taking in refugees.

“Why should we believe them when they cheated us last year twice?” Kovács asked.

As for the referendum, he said it would send a powerful message to Brussels: “It’s going to be a big deal.”
