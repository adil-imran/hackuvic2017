Mohd Ashraf Othman said the police recorded the statements of Professor Shaharir Md Zain of Gerakan Mansuhkan PPSMI (GMP), Datuk Zainal Abidin Borhan of National Education Action Council, Faizal Abd Aziz of Malaysian Islamic Youth Movement (Abim), and Rozan Azen of Seniman PAKSI Rakyat at the Dang Wangi police headquarters here today.

"The police are probing the case under Section 4(2)(b) and Section 9(5) of the Peaceful Assembly Act," he told reporters outside the Dang Wangi police headquarters.

Section 4(2)(b) finds one wrong if he or she participates or organises an assembly at a prohibited place.

Section 9(5) states that a person, upon conviction, is liable to a fine not exceeding RM10,000.

Seniman PAKSI Rakyat’s Rozan said he was puzzled as to why the police called them up, noting that police presence were heavy during the March 26 gathering against the programme introduced this year that gives students the option to study several subjects in English or Bahasa Malaysia.

"We did submit a notification about the gathering many days before the event to KL City Council and the police but there was no response.

"But the police were still present during the day of gathering, so why call us again?" he questioned.

The anti-DLP rally of some 70 people on March 26 in the city centre, which had a mock coffin to symbolise their intent to bury the education programme, featured Malay language activists, national laureate Datuk Baharuddin Zainal popularly known as Baha Zain, as well as opposition politicians like PKR vice-president Chua Tian Chang.

A second rally is expected to be held in the city on April 9 at Dataran Merdeka, according to GMP’s Shaharir.
