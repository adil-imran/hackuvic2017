Government urged to run after bombers

MANILA, Philippines - Human rights groups yesterday condemned the Abu Sayyaf bandit group for last Friday’s bombing in Davao City, which killed 15 persons and wounded 70 others.

While expressing condolence and sympathy for the families of the victims and Davao residents, rights group Karapatan urged the government to make the perpetrators accountable for he incident.

Karapatan president Cristina Palabay urged President Duterte to look into the possible involvement of the military and the US government in the attack.

“Historically, the Abu Sayyaf bandits and their acts have always been supported by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the US government. Both had a hand in the creation of the said group,” Palabay said.

She said bombings and other terrorist attacks have been used to create chaos and justify the increased US intervention and military presence in the country, as well as violations committed by the US and Philippine governments and the AFP.

Palabay warned that the state of lawlessness in Basilan declared by former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in 2001 resulted in warrantless arrests, torture and illegal detention of Muslim civilians mistook for Abu Sayyaf bandits.

Investigations later revealed the civilians were not bandits, and that the AFP and the US Central Intelligence Agency were involved in the actions of the Abu Sayyaf.

Karapatan also expressed alarm over the declaration of state of lawlessness by President Duterte and questioned the operational guidelines on the apprehension of individuals in checkpoints.

Amnesty International urged the government to uphold human rights as it responds to the Davao attack.

“Victims and survivors, including the families of those who have lost their lives or injured, have a right to seek and obtain justice. The government should respect this right by ordering an independent, impartial, transparent and effective investigation, leading to fair trials of suspected perpetrators,” Champa Patel, Amnesty senior research adviser for South East Asia and the Pacific, said.

Patel said the callous disregard shown by the attackers for the people’s right to life must not be met by government action that itself disregards human rights.

“Resort to unlawful killings, arbitrary arrests or other human rights violations will only play into the hands of those who seek an ever-widening cycle of violence and abuse,” he added.

Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano said it’s time for all sides to stand together as a nation, and behind the nation’s and the President’s fight against drugs and criminality, including the viciousness of the Abu Sayyaf bandit group

Sen. Panfilo Lacson said it’s important that investigators find out the brains behind the bombing first before any conclusion or decision is made.

Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV said the Davao attack was a grim reminder that the illegal drug problem is not the largest and definitely not the only national security threat to the country.

Eastern Samar Rep. Ben Evardone described the Davao bombing as a cowardly attack against innocent civilians. He urged Congress and the Filipinos to reaffirm their trust and support for President Duterte, the AFP and the Philippine National Police in the fight against terrorism.

Davao City Rep. Karlo Nograles said it was hard to believe that civilians had to be sacrificed just to weaken the government’s resolve to give the people a life of peace and progress.

“Knowing President Duterte, this attack in Davao City will only strengthen his resolve to wipe them (bandits) out from the face of this planet. It will only cement his government’s commitment to win the war against drugs and terrorism. It will only motivate our people to unite and rally behind our President in his campaign to institute lasting and meaningful reforms,” Nograles said. – Artemio Dumlao, Jess Diaz, Janvic Mateo, Rainier Allan Ronda, Rhodina Villanueva, Marvin Sy, Ding Cervantes
