Cops fear terror suspects could radicalise other inmates if they are not jailed in isolation

Fearing that jailed terror suspects may spread jihadi ideology among other prisoners, the Delhi Police want them to be housed in isolation.

The Delhi police's anti-terror unit has already isolated three accused – Sajid Abassi, Shakir Ansari, and Sameer Ahmad – suspected to be sympathisers of the banned Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) in the High Security Ward (HSW) of the Tihar jail.

HSW residents are separated from other inmates and confined to their cells the whole day. They are let out for an hour everyday and allowed to walk in the corridors of their wards.

The idea of isolation first came from BJP leader Amit Shah when he was Gujarat’s home minister. Last year, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh put it into practice when he sent an advisory to all states to set up separate cells for suspected terrorists.

The families of the accused had moved the Delhi court in July this year complaining of isolation. The superintendent of Tihar jail Amit Kumar submitted that the three were shifted on the request of the Delhi joint commissioner (central cell 1) V Ranganathan.

The three were arrested on May 4 this year in an operation that lasted 13 hours and involving 60 policemen from the Delhi special cell after raids on 13 locations in Delhi and UP. The police have charged them under Sections 18, 18B and 20 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

“The three have to be kept under strict watch so that they do not mingle with other inmates,” Kumar stated in a written reply. “Also, it has to be ensured that they do not get access to cellphones or other communication devices,” he said.

Other inmates confined to the HSW include those suspected to be members of ISIS by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).

According to the jail manual, prisoners accused and convicted of terror activities are lodged in the HSW, which are under the constant supervision of the prison staff and paramilitary forces.

Other criminals in the HSW include Rajan Sadashiv Nikhaljhe, better known as Chhota Rajan, and Mohammed Arif, who was convicted in 2000 after a terror shoot-out at Red Fort.
