GETTY Vladimir Putin cancels Paris trip as Francois Hollande said he will only discuss Syrian conflict

Putin was hoping to speak about more “sensitive subjects” with the French President, but discussions were off the table. The Russian leader was also set to inaugurate a new Orthodox cathedral and visit a Russian art exhibition, but Mr Hollande declined an invitation to join him. In an outburst on French radio station Europe 1, Alexandre Orlov, the Russian ambassador to France, said: “Presidents are expected to find solutions to difficult problems. Mr Putin will come and will speak to Mr Hollande about touchy subjects.”

But after Mr Hollande declined, Mr Putin cancelled his plans. A French presidency source said: "There were contacts between the Kremlin and the Elysée this morning to offer to Putin a working visit on Syria, but excluding all other events that President Hollande could have taken part in. "In response to this proposal, Russia has just indicated that it wants to postpone the visit planned on October 19."

The Russian president’s looming visit had sparked much outrage and controversy, and many French officials did not know whether he should be welcomed with open arms, or shunned.

Especially Mr Hollande, who, unlike Mr Putin, is less of a fighter, and more of a pacifist. On Saturday, when Mr Putin’s visit was a ‘done deal’, the French president admitted his reluctance, and said he strongly opposed Russia’s involvement in the Syrian war. Russian troops are currently fighting alongside the ‘tyrannical’ Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, who has been accused of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity for his unrelenting assault on Aleppo. Other French officials had already said Mr Putin’s impending visit made them feel uncomfortable.

Foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, had already warned his Russian counterpart that Mr Hollande would want to talk about Syria. He said: “If the president agrees to meet with Mr Putin, it will not be to exchange pleasantries, it will be to speak openly about the conflict in Syria and to tell the Russians that they are headed down a dangerous path.” But Mr Ayrault also said that despite their differences, Russia remained a valued ally, and, unlike Mr al-Assad, was not France’s enemy.

Presidential hopeful François Fillon said Mr Hollande “had to meet” with the Russian because the two leaders were “not at war”. He said: “War crimes are being committed in Aleppo and the Syrian government must be punished. But we turned a blind eye to the conflict for more than four years, and so we are also to blame. We should have made the Russians our allies when we had the chance.”
