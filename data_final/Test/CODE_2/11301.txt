Johannesburg - Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba condemned the destruction of property and looting during “FeesMustFall” protests in Braamfontein and called on the police to arrests perpetrators.

Mashaba said although everyone had a right to protest to highlight the plight of students crippled by tuition fees, criminal activities would not be tolerated in the city. A bus was set alight, motorists pelted with stones and shops looted during a protest by University of Witwatersrand in Braamfontein on Monday.

“These acts are nothing but criminal and there should be serious consequences for those found responsible. Our metro police will work hand in hand with the SA Police Service to bring those responsible for the mayhem to book … we will not stand by and watch while human life is endangered and infrastructure is destroyed,” Mashaba said in a statement on Tuesday.

Mashaba, who had earlier undertaken a walkabout in Braamfontein to assess the damage left behind by “FeesMustFall” protesters, promised business owners that security would be beefed up in Braamfontein’s streets, open spaces and around business precincts.

A meeting between Mashaba and Wits vice-chancellor Adam Habib was planned for Tuesday. Mashaba would also consult with Tiego Moseneke, leader of the former Black Students Society and Students Representatives Council at Wits, who was part of the a mediation team working with the university to resolve the impasse between the institution and protesting students.

“During these meetings, we will discuss the university council decision to keep JMPD off university campuses in Johannesburg and focus on their responsibility to protect people and infrastructure outside of campuses. We will also discuss the role the city can play in assisting universities and students.”

The city was in a process of coming up with “something significant” regarding student funding, said Mashaba.

“We will be in a position to announce it within 30 days. We acknowledge the legitimate concerns of many students who cannot afford tuition fees and we need to create a more inclusive, fair and equal society. These students can play a vital role in future economic growth, job creation and service delivery in our City,” he said.
