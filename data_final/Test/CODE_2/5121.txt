An unregistered nanny has been charged after two newborn twins she was caring for ended up in a coma for 20 hours.

The twins were rushed to Brisbane's Lady Cilento Hospital last week after their mother and paramedics were unable to rouse them for a night-time feed.

The incident has served as a warning to parents who have been asked to be extra vigilant when hiring nannies.

Police have charged the 41-year-old nanny with being unregistered without a blue card, which is required in the state of Queensland when working with children, and are investigating the incident.

An unregistered nanny has been charged after two newborn twins she was caring for ended up in a coma for more than 20 hours

She is due to appear in Brisbane Magistrates Court on September 26.

It is understood the couple hired the nanny through a Facebook parenting group with about 3,000 members and wrongly believing she held a blue card.

They had sought a nanny after the twins' grandmother got sick and the mother required an extra hand looking after the newborns as her husband was a shift worker.

Australian Nannies Association president Annemarie Sansom, who had been in contact with the newborns' parents, said the nanny had been promoting herself on the Brisbane-based Facebook parenting group.

'The family engaged with [the nanny] and another friend of the family actually vouched for her because they had used her themselves,' Ms Sansom told Daily Mail Australia.

The babies were handed over to the nanny's care one night last week by their mother who wanted to have a rest and remained at home.

'They were fine, healthy and then found later in the evening, when they had missed their feeding time, unable to wake up. So mum then went to find out what was going on,' Ms Sansom told Daily Mail Australia.

'They [the parents] tried for two hours to wake them and they got concerned and called an ambulance.'

Ms Sansom said paramedics were also unable to rouse the babies even though their vitals were okay.

They were put into the nanny's care at 8pm and did not wake up until 20 hours later at 4pm the next day.

'[The parents] are very distressed about the situation. They are first-time parents with two little babies,' Ms Sansom said.

'The mother is on maternity leave... she did not leave the premises.'

The newborns have returned home to their parents.

Ms Sansom said there were steps parents should take to ensure the welfare of their children.

'I don't want parents to be discourage from using nannies but do the right checks and engage service providers who provide those checks,' she said.

'Do your research on what the requirements are before you engage so you can minimise any risks.'

Ms Sansom said parents should sight a blue card, get a national police check, first aid certificates, CPR certificates, and go through multiple references.

'Just be very certain they know as much as possible about who they're hiring,' she added.
