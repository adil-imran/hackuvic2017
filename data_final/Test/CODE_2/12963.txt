While steelworkers in Port Talbot stare into the abyss, a Saudi playboy swans around London in a fleet of golden supercars.

As a snapshot of modern Britain, it says as much about the state of the nation as that famous old photograph of street urchins staring at top-hatted Harrow public school boys said about the class divide in 1937.

The rich have always been with us. But the chasm between the ultra-wealthy and the common herd has never been greater.

At least the old British moneyed classes maintained a certain decorous restraint. OK, so they lived in grand townhouses and on country estates, but few ever flaunted their money in the faces of the hoi polloi.

Rolls-Royces were a rarity, even in the swankier postcodes, and came in a range of discreet colours. No self-respecting aristocrat or self-made beer baron would have been seen dead in a gaudy, gold-plated Lamborghini Aventador.

For the past few days a Saudi ‘businessman’ called Turki Bin Abdullah has been making a spectacle of himself in Knightsbridge and Chelsea.

He’s been showing off his specially imported £350,000 Aventador, £370,000 six-wheeler Mercedes AMG off-roader, £350,000 Rolls Phantom Coupe, £220,000 Bentley Flying Spur and £180,000 Lambo Huracan — all painted a uniform shade of gold.

Given his collection is worth £1.5 million, you might have thought he’d have hired a private garage or used valet parking at one of the five-star hotels and restaurants he frequents.

No, he’s left them on the street, where they have been racking up parking tickets at £40 a pop, as well as becoming something of a tourist attraction.

Still, I’m sure he can afford to pay the fines out of petty cash and still have enough left over for a lobster supper at the nearest gentlemen’s club.

Abdullah is said to have links to the Saudi royal family. Haven’t they all? The Saudis must have more ‘princes’ than the KGB used to have ‘colonels’.

Most of them seem to be resident in London for at least part of the year. The Middle East has moved to Mayfair, where someone described as the ‘first cousin’ of the Emir of Qatar lives in a £200 million, 17-bedroom pad on Park Lane.

Gulf state gazillionaires have been hoovering up homes worth billions in London’s most fashionable districts, which were once the hunting ground of dowager duchesses and the genteel-but-cash-strapped members of the landed gentry.

These days, if you find a belted earl in Mayfair, he’ll probably be working as a ‘concierge’ to oil-rich Arabs and other dubious ‘oligarchs’ from around the world.

Entire industries have grown up to service the influx of foreign funny money. The best seat in the house? My pleasure. A helicopter? No problem. Some ‘high-class’ female company sent up to your suite? Your wish is my command, effendi.

Russians, Chinese, Nigerians. Come on down! Over the past few years, London has become the Number One destination for wealthy foreigners seeking a safe haven from less agreeable regimes and regional instability.

The knock-on effect is that property prices overall have gone into the stratosphere, with shockwaves being felt in the suburbs and beyond.

So imagine how Londoners, priced out of the housing market and forced either to use expensive, overcrowded public transport or pay extortionate congestion charges to drive to work, feel when they see casually abandoned gold Lamborghinis — bearing licence plates in Arabic and festooned with contemptuously ignored parking tickets. Why haven’t they been clamped and towed away?

Our capital city is the go-to venue for rich-as-Croesus foreigners intent on obscene and ostentatious displays of conspicuous consumption.

Witness the wedding celebrations of the son of Russia’s ‘King of Bling’ Mikhail Gutseriev, which have moved to London after a ghastly, money-no-object ceremony in Moscow. They promise modestly to ‘knock the spots off William and Kate’s nuptials’.

The bride’s Disney Princess frock alone cost £700,000. The cabaret at the London leg is reported to be Elton John and Beyonce.

As Kenny Everett’s TV character Cupid Stunt used to declare: ‘And all in the best paaahhhsable taste!’

London was the natural choice for Mr Gutseriev, who moved to Britain for three years while being investigated for tax crimes in Russia.

He was eventually cleared, but during his exile here, he fell in love with the place. Of course he did. What’s not to like about London if you’re a Russian oil tycoon worth £4.3 billion? Just sign here, sir. Absolutely, cash will do nicely.

No wonder, when confronted with this petro-dollar-fuelled excess, the natives are getting restless. There’s a whiff in the air of pre-Revolution France, or Cuba before Castro kicked out the flash ‘Yanquis’ partying in their mob-funded casinos in Havana.

Meanwhile, the Government stands accused of colluding in the collapse of the steel industry because it opposed higher tariffs on dumped Chinese steel rather than risk upsetting Beijing

In Lady Windermere’s Fan, Oscar Wilde wrote that a cynic is someone who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. It was a clever line, but was never intended to be an economic blueprint.

Yet in the desperate dash to attract foreign cash, we as a nation have abandoned all vestige of decency and principle. Our policy is to prostrate ourselves before anyone with a big enough bank balance, no questions asked.

Who are all these ‘oligarchs’ we’re welcoming? How did they come into their vast wealth?

In the case of those from the former Soviet Union, they became rich through privatisation of former state industries such as gas and oil. They’re not all brilliant businessmen, they just knew the right people and greased the right palms.

The Saudis and the other Middle Eastern moguls simply had the good fortune to be sitting on vast reservoirs of crude oil. They ruthlessly protect their wealth and power with militarily enforced suppression of individual liberty and free speech.

Yet we are prepared to overlook their humanitarian transgressions in exchange for a few scraps from their groaning tables.

We parade our ‘liberal’ credentials, yet are only too willing to do business with dictators and one-party, gangster states who don’t even pay lip service to human rights.

Britain ostracised and boycotted apartheid South Africa, but sucks up to Muslim countries where they hang homosexuals and treat women like dirt.

Still, our principles are immaterial if the price is right. There’s nothing we won’t knock out to the highest bidder.

First, we sold off our traditional manufacturing industries to overseas investors, then our public utilities, then just about anything which wasn’t nailed down. It sometimes feels as if we’ve sold our very soul.

We don’t own our airports, our railways, our water companies. We’re even letting the Chinese build our nuclear power stations. We must be stark, staring mad.

Can you imagine the Americans handing over their nuclear industry to a rival military power controlled by Communists?

Precisely.

Meanwhile, the Government stands accused of colluding in the collapse of the steel industry because it opposed higher tariffs on dumped Chinese steel rather than risk upsetting Beijing.

Sounds about right.

Yesterday, 3,000 redundancy-threatened South Wales steel workers queued for hours to apply for jobs at a new Aston Martin factory, which is opening 18 miles from Port Talbot and will build a luxury ‘crossover’ model costing a very reasonable £160,000.
