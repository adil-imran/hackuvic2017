Anbang Insurance Group's flotation poses a test for global investment banks. In a dozen short years the Chinese insurer has shot from provincial obscurity to control nearly US$300 billion in assets. Now it wants to float a life-insurance unit in Hong Kong.The deal has already generated a noteable opt-out: people familiar with the matter say Morgan Stanley is not contesting the mandate. The reasons are unclear: one person says the bank is avoiding a conflict of interest.In any case, however, other investment banks will have to do their own homework carefully. Their checklist will run something like this: First, is this unit fit for public consumption?Bankers will need to understand Anbang's explosive growth, and how the business is managed. The company has already drawn attention with its aborted US$14 billion bid for Starwood Hotels.Second, who owns the parent company, whose assets include New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel? At present this is not clear.The New York Times identified various people who, at least on paper, own shares in the private company, including relatives and acquaintances of chairman Wu Xiaohui. Anbang says it has both individual and institutional shareholders who took "commercial" decisions to invest.Third, what risks do Anbang's political ties pose? Wu is married to a granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping.Chen Xiaolu, a Communist Party scion, told Caixin magazine last year he and Wu had been business partners for 15 years but denied owning shares. Both Chen and Levin Zhu, son of former Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, appear in official online records as former directors, although Zhu says he never served on the board.This is more than cosmetic box-ticking. Nowadays sponsors involved in Hong Kong deals can be fined, lose licences or even theoretically face criminal charges for dodgy flotations. Most underwriters are also subject to US laws on foreign corruption, sanctions and money-laundering.

Of course, there could well be good answers to all these questions. Other mainland debutants have jumped through similar hoops. And most big banks are jockeying to take part in the deal. Still, this listing will be a high-profile challenge. - Reuters
