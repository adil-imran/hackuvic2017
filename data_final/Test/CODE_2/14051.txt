Wilfried W. ,46, grinned when he appeared in court yesterday in Paderborn charged with the murders of two women. His ex-wife, Angelika B., 47, was brought into the dock near him in handcuffs but the two did not acknowledge one another. The court heard how the duo from the western town of Hoexter were sexual deviants who lured women to their home.

Their trial began 182 days after they were arrested. The court heard that victim number one, Annika W., 33, was chained to a radiator in their home, forced to soil herself and sleep in a bathtub. According to prosecutors, Angelike B. "half drowned" the woman in a bathtub before letting her free to crawl for her life across the courtyard of their home with her skull fractured. Another death in April this year led to a raid on the home and the arrest of the duo.

Annike's body was allegedly stuck into a deep freeze, thawed out and burned in a stove. Her ashes were later strewn from the car window of her murderers. The pair –married but divorced and living in the quiet community as brother and sister – preyed upon lonely hearts across the country looking for women for Wilfried to wed so they could then fleece them of their savings.

Wilfried's lawyers are hoping to prove that he has a "sadistic abnormality" that could mean the difference between going to jail or a psychiatric hospital. The court heard that he was sentenced to a jail term in 1995 for torturing his first wife. The terrible secret of the house in Hoexter was revealed in April this year when Susanne F. 41, a divorced woman who answered one of their bogus adverts, died of a brain haemorrhage resulting from her ill treatment. Police said she replied to Wilfried's small ad looking for a girlfriend and moved into the house, believing the lie that his ex-wife was his sister.
