WA children living in areas without water fluoridation are 60 per cent more likely to have bad teeth, a major report reveals.

As the State Government prepares to extend fluoridation to Yanchep and parts of the Kimberley, a study of almost 11,000 children aged five to 12 has confirmed fluoride in drinking water protects against decay.

The findings coincide with the release of a National Health and Medical Research Council review into water fluoridation, which rules out safety concerns but concedes some people can develop small, harmless “lines” on the surface of their teeth.

More than 90 per cent of WA’s population has access to water fluoridation, with the Perth metropolitan area fluoridated for more than 40 years.

Some pockets of the State do not have the water additive, including the South West centres of Bunbury, Busselton and Margaret River.

The WA Health Department study compared children who visited government dental centres in Perth in 2011 and 2012 with those who attended clinics in areas of the South West without fluoridation.

It found children from unfluoridated areas were 1.6 times more likely to have decayed, missing or permanently filled teeth compared with those drinking fluoridated water.

The biggest difference between the two groups of children was at the ages of five and seven years.

Very young children without access to fluoridated water were 50 per cent more likely to have decayed, missing or filled baby teeth.

Health Minister John Day, who was a dentist before entering politics, said water fluoridation was the single most important public health measure to prevent tooth decay.

He said results from the WA study supported the findings from similar research around the world.

“As a former dentist, I know only too well the impact of tooth decay,” he said.

“As well as the pain, infection and tooth loss, it can disrupt eating, sleeping and social interaction.

“Ongoing oral infections are associated with heart and lung disease, stroke and poor pregnancy outcomes.”

Mr Day said the Government had recently introduced water fluoridation to Moora, Dongara and Port Denison.

It was expected to come online in Port Hedland by the end of the year and next year in Newman, Kununurra and Yanchep.

Protest group Fluoride Free WA said the Government was forcing people to drink fluoridated water instead of letting them take responsibility for their own health.

It is due to present a petition to the State Parliament today, calling on MPs to repeal the 1966 Act enforcing fluoridated water supplies.

President James Fairbairn said the Government should be investing more money in dental health education and treatment services.

The NHMRC draft information paper, which follows a review in 2014, said previous research showed water fluoridation reduced tooth decay by 26 per cent to 44 per cent in children and adults.

Its committee of health, dental and other experts found current levels of fluoridation in Australia did not cause any negative health effects.

Not all regions needed added fluoridation to their water supplies, but generally Australia had very low levels of naturally occurring fluoride.

The review found no evidence linking water fluoridation to conditions such as cancer and muscle and skeletal disorders, and insufficient evidence about associations with chronic kidney disease, heart disease and high blood pressure.

While some people developed a slight change in the cosmetic appearance of their teeth, known as mild dental fluorosis, it did not affect the function of the teeth.

The NHMRC said the costs involved in having a fluoridated water supply had been shown to be significantly lower than the savings gained in less dental treatments.
