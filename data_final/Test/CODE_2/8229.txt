The unnamed woman, originally from Turkey but has lived in Austria for 16 years, and her 18-year-old son had been convicted of cruelty after carrying out a ritual slaughter of a sheep. The mother and son from the southern city of Graz had killed three sheep on a nearby farm by cutting their throats with a knife as a way of giving thanks for their father recovering from a bout of illness. The student, 17 at the time of the offence, had called several farmers in the area, asking about sheep for sale he had found on the internet.

The farmers agreed the sale and the boy had wanted to kill the sheep there rather than at home to avoid the mess. He told the court: “I laid them on the ground and my mother held the legs behind, then I said a quotation from the Koran and closed the sheep's eyes." He then cut the throats of the animals before they were loaded into the car.

It took two or three minutes for the animals to bleed to death. The boy said he was unaware that sheep could not be killed without anaesthetic. In Austria, animals can only be slaughtered in licensed slaughterhouses, and must be given anaesthesia immediately after their artery is cut.

The mother also claimed to be unaware of the law and told the court: “We had to make a sacrifice.” When she was told she would have to serve 150 hours of community service she told the court that she could not do it due to having to look after her husband and that she would have to ask his permission before saying whether or not she could accept the ruling. The judge then said that she would have to make the decision and once again she stated she need her husband’s permission and maybe an alternative would be to pay a fine.
