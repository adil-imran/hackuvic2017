Hillary Clintons Health Scare, Pneumonia Diagnosis Fuel Speculation Of Cover-Up

Health concerns that have dogged Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for months burst to the forefront Sunday when she abruptly left a 9/11 commemoration ceremony due to illness, and her campaign later reluctantly acknowledged that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia days earlier.

Overheating and then pneumonia. 90 minutes separate a lie. The Felon is busted again.

It’s easier for her to lie than tell the truth.

If the Washington Times is serious, they should fully vet the following. Having transient, convenient, and selective amnesia allows for a false plausible deniability and has apparently become an endearing quality to her supporters. She just claims not to remember, blames her memory loss on the 2012 concussion, insists that people accept that as an excuse, it then turns it into a false apology, and it's all GOOD. See how this works? There has to be more to the story. Can anyone help out filling in the tick-tock on the following time line? Where was Huma? Did Huma take medical leave? Is there a flight log as to what kind of aircraft the State Department assigned to her in this time frame? Did the State Department either damage a C-12 Huron or is there one missing from the inventory? Did she start negotiating with Iran on the nuke deal in this time frame? Will Assange have more "personal" emails in the Dec 2012-Feb 2013 time frame which may reveal more? Regarding the "fall", there are conflicting reports. Some say it "happened at home". Which home? Was there an ambulance call? Some say the fall hapened in her 17th-floor office at the State Department. Was there an ambulance call? So which is it? At one of her homes, or in her office?



Helment given to Hillary from her staff "for the next time she flies".

It occurred to me a while ago that according to NY state law, abuse of the elderly is a felony. Shouldn’t they arrest Hitlery’s entire inner circle for what they are doing to that poor woman? (not that she doesn’t richly deserve it)

Wow, Drudge has a video of it on the top of his page. I don’t remember ever seeing a video at the top of Drudge’s page. This is amazing. I feel like I am in Bizarro land, seriously.



To: Sasparilla

Yep. They lied. Perhaps twice. So it is not overheating, but is it really pneumonia? I think that is the 2nd lie of the day. Fox’ Brett Baier went into detail on her Friday schedule. It was very heavy schedule for a person with pneumonia . When did she have time to see doc on Friday? How do she manage the meetings Fri without collapsing?

Gee, ya think? They lie about everything - and Hillary get can’t back from changing out a diaper during a commercial break. Hillary is in the advanced stages of a fatal disease. -



To: Helicondelta

....Mrs. Clinton is weathering a deluge of speculation about her health, including claims that she suffers from debilitating conditions ranging from seizures and dementia to Parkinsons disease that would impair her service in the Oval Office.... Speculation??? LOL

The question has always been Why did Hillary set up a secret bathroom basement server? 0bama and the DOJ can wave their magic wand and all of the corruption and criminality goes away. 0bama and the DOJ cannot disappear a severe medical condition

She should be handed over to the death panel, given the pills and told to go home. Take one for the totalitarian team.

Meet the Press was much worse. They said that this requires more openness. And then went on a rant that Trump did not disclose as much medical information as Hillary. Then they marched into the lack of Trump tax returns. So they swerved and curved until it was Trumps fault. It never seemed to occur to them that Hillary did not and still is not giving the whole or the important part of her health report. Meet the press is so lame. Propaganda in Russia is no worse than Meet the Press.



To: SERKIT

The whole story the media are reporting is bull crap. The woman is sick or damaged, and that beyond what ails most of her failed hippy klan. It will become like a sad accident you can’t avert your eyes from. A debate? She’ll be so drugged-up she’ll self-destruct. But the media sycophants will go to any lengths to cover. TC

9:59 AM, DEC 31, 2012 | By DANIEL HALPER

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, perhaps the most famous current female political figure, has fallen ill. “In the course of a follow-up exam today, Secretary Clinton’s doctors discovered a blood clot had formed, stemming from the concussion she sustained several weeks ago. She is being treated with anti-coagulants and is at New York-Presbyterian Hospital so that they can monitor the medication over the next 48 hours,” a spokesman for the former first lady said yesterday in a statement. Clinton’s illness, and the fact that she has not been seen in public in the last three weeks, has prompted a slew of wild conspiracy theories. “EXCLUSIVE! HILLARY CLINTON BRAIN CRISIS,” the National Enquirer headline reads. “Only days after The ENQUIRER exclusively reported that Secretary of State HILLARY CLINTON was at the center of a shocking brain cancer drama and was undergoing extensive secret medical tests, her reps went public with the news on Sunday night Dec. 30 that she was indeed hospitalized in New York City and disclosed that she was battling a blood clot that had formed following her head concussion earlier this month!” Another report, this one in eutimes.net, shockingly claims, “A new Foreign Military Intelligence (GRU) report circulating in the Kremlin today is saying that United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was injured, and a top US Navy Seal Commander killed when their C-12 Huron military passenger and transport aircraft crash landed nearly 3 weeks ago in the Iranian city of Ahvaz near the Iraqi border.” Before Clinton’s admittance into the hospital over the weekend, some speculated that the timing of Clinton’s illness was suspicious. After all, she was scheduled to testify in front of Congress about the terror attack on 9/11 in Benghazi, Libya. That testimony was postponed. Of course, many are still wondering whether Clinton will testify before she steps down as secretary of state, which her office has long claimed she’ll do within “days” of President Obama’s second inauguration. Obama has nominated another former Democratic presidential nominee to replace Clinton, Senator John Kerry. So will Clinton be well enough to testify before Kerry can be confirmed? Or will her illness prevent her from answering questions about the terror attack in Benghazi?

Just maybe someone is causing her to become ill. (Puts on tinfoil hat).



To: moovova

Her official doctor needs to disclose the truth. But, are doctors bound to secrecy unless the patient wants to disclose the truth? Even if this patient is possibly steps away from the presidency? At this point, any info that is given to the press is a lie and a cover up of a very sick woman.

So, on Friday Hillary’s doctor says she has pneumonia. And he let’s her go on with her schedule like everything’s fine. BS.

Let’s hope she makes it to the election, because if she drops out, the Dems will pick Biden to run. I can just see Biden giving his last speech before the election. Quoting his dying son’s last wish that his father run for president to save the nation. The sympathy vote will sink any chance Trump has.



To: gogeo

Hillary cover up !! Hell, put her in a Burka and her problems will go away !



To: moovova

Shes been having coughing fits for at least a year. She had to be pulled up a flight of stairs in February because she lost her balance Last week she was coughing and gagging on stage for 4-5 minutes. Then on the plane she had to excuse herself for another coughing fit. We were called “conspiracy theorists”. We were told cough related to allergies. Now they tell us it’s pneumonia. Today the doctor said Clinton had a bout of light-headedness and was recovering nicely She was dragged semi-conscious into a van. You dont recover from pneumonia in an hour or two. And what was she doing on the sidewalk hugging a kid? Shes ill. The frequency and severity of her health incidents are increasing, not decreasing. The stream of lies coming out of these people is incredible.

To: lombardwarrior2

The thing is....if you have walking pneumonia....you generally get prescribed a minimum of two weeks of house-rest (some older folks need three weeks). But if you have health complications on top of this (blood sugar, etc)....then you can throw another two weeks on top of that. I don’t see her back in operation until 1 October. The 26 Sep debate, I think, will have to be cancelled. My guess is that the 4 Oct debate might still occur although she might not be 100-percent recovered by that point. Course, all of this is dependent on her having walking pneumonia....when it might actually be something else entirely different. It does give her two to three weeks of house-rest.

Whoa, wait just a minute. I’ve not clicked on any of the body double threads assuming they were satire, are just kooky. Is that comparison pic for real?

I think der Hildebeast has aspirational pneumonia which is the leading cause of death from Parkinson’s. Parkinson’s causes a swallowing disorder which causes fluids to go into the lungs and develop an infection. If this is the case, we are seeing another case of der Hildebeast’s poor decision making ability. If she was told that she has pneumonia, Friday, she should have checked into a hospital; not the campaign trail. Her lying is another case of not having proper decision making ability. Good decision making ability would choose to tell the truth. Not this sub-intellect.

Pnemonia. Yeah, first thing Id do if I had pnemonia is go to my daughters home and risk infecting my 2-year-old and infant grandkids. Uh huh, sure. If thats what it was, she would have gone elsewhere. OTOH, if all you need is to get shot up with some drugs, rest for a bit and get made-up for the cameras, then your daughters home is perfect. Then you can go outside and hug a little girl, cuz you’re feeling much better and that pneumonia is no big deal (not until you want and excuse not to debate, or at least to sit on a stool.

This past Wednesday at NBC’s “Commander In Chief Forum” Clinton said I communicated about classified material on a wholly separate system than her personal system. What system she was referring to? What e-mail address did she use on this system? Or did she lie to the vet, the Forum, and the U.S.? She needs to answer these questions. I don’t care that she’s falling down in the street, she needs to answer the questions. She’s well enough to go out on the sidewalk and hug a kid, she well enough to answer the questions. Don’t let her worm out of it.
