GETTY The European Union may close its internal borders for 24 hours to teach the UK a Brexit lesson

The vengeful plan has been put forward by Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel, who accused the UK of wanting to “have its cake and eat it” by blocking open borders but staying in the single market. He dismissed the UK’s desire to block free travel but stay in the single market, claiming “we’re not on Facebook where there’s an ‘it’s complicated’ status.” Mr Bettel, who is Jean-Claude Juncker’s successor as the Luxembourg PM, said: “Shutting the frontiers for a day would show people what it means to wait two hours to get into Italy or Spain, to have controls everywhere, to block all exchanges.

“One day. So that people see what it is to be outside Europe. It’s terrible what I’m saying, but it would be good for people to understand.”

He said the EU needs to “remain firm” on the UK’s exit negotiations - with his proposal a thinly-veiled attack on the country’s Leave voters, who consistently listed open borders as a major concern during the lead-up to this summer’s referendum. The 43-year-old concluded: “Before they were in and they had many opt-outs; now they want to be out with many opt-ins. “We’re not on Facebook where there’s an ‘it’s complicated’ status.”

Eurocrats will meet in Brussels next week to discuss how to halt the EU crisis and boost confidence in the ailing 28-country bloc. Leaders are alarmed at Theresa May’s indications she favours a hard Brexit, and also at the threat of further referendums on the horizon.
