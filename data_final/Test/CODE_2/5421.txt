Missouri families confront School Board over graphic sex ed programs targeting young children.

What you are about to read about will be happening more and more around the country. Are you ready to fight it?

Parents from Missouri MassResistance stood up to pro-LGBT activists and continued to confront the school board in their effort to stop a horrific LGBT-sexuality curriculum being imposed on their school system in suburban St. Louis.

As we reported earlier the new district-wide comprehensive sexuality curriculum voted in by the Parkway District School Board in March aims to normalize homosexuality and cross-dressing beginning in the lower elementary school grades. It includes lessons about oral and anal sex for middle schoolers, abortion counseling for young girls, a pornographic childrens book in its reading list, and much more. School officials are clearly working closely with national LGBT groups and Planned Parenthood.

The latest confrontation took place at the August 24 Parkway School Board meeting. There had been rumors that the Board might agree to the demands of hundreds of local parents and re-vote -- to rescind the curriculum.

So local LGBT activists came to the meeting to pressure the Board and harass the parents. The school maintains a façade that these programs are independently generated. In fact, the national homosexual movement, along with Planned Parenthood, are the forces behind them.

But the Board reassured the LGBT community that their pet project is safe. At the beginning of the meeting the Chairman arrogantly announced that the original vote stands and the Board is not even considering a re-vote. That was followed by a long period of loud clapping by the LGBT group. Nevertheless, the real message was that the parents are getting to them. The parents were not intimidated.

When they get opposition from parents, LGBT activists often react by becoming more aggressive. Their tactics include harassing, intimidating, and confusing parents. This is what they employ around the country:

Any criticism of the sex-ed program or the methods used to implement it constitutes hate. This charge is levelled constantly.

They say the reason for these sex-ed programs, even in the elementary grades, is student safety and to prevent bullying. Thus if you dont support it, you are against students being safe.

They accuse pro-family people of saying mean and horrible things about them personally. (In fact, the opposite is true.) They rarely offer any actual evidence. If parents record their testimony at school board meetings (which is also videoed and posted by the school) they claim that is mean and intimidating.

They harangue conservatives with Why cant we co-exist? This foot in the door tactic is very deceptive because means that conservatives must accept the destructive LGBT programs in the schools. They often add Your kids can opt-out. But the opt-out process is invariably crafted to be a difficult and humiliating process.

At the Aug. 24 meeting, members of the pro-LGBT group spoke before the Board and also interacted with individual parents during the intermission and immediately after the meeting.

A particularly appalling tactic was for some of them to take the podium, but instead of addressing the Board, they would turn and scream insults at the pro-family parents sitting in the audience. The Board chairman clearly had no problem with that.

This gay high school student has spoken at several Board meetings. He seems very troubled. He appears obsessed with forcing these sexuality/ homosexuality programs on all K-12 students. Parents have noticed that his Twitter feed includes a picture of a full-frontal nude man. When he got to the podium he turned to the pro-family parents and began a disjointed rant at them. He said he was shaking right now. He accused them of spewing lies upon lies and saying that he would go to hell. He told the parents that if they dont like the sex-ed program at Parkway schools there lots of other districts and private institutions that you may go to, but we stand for equality.

Parents told us that the boy became so unhinged that police eventually had to escort him out of the building.

That same evening the student appeared on local St. Louis television and repeated his bizarre accusations against the pro-family group (apparently taped earlier in the day).

During a recess of the meeting, a pro-LGBT parent (accompanied by a "gay" man apparently from outside the district) confronted some pro-family parents. Their interaction reveals the kind of self-centered irrationality that is commonly used on pro-family people questioning the curriculum:

Pro-LGBT parent: We can have different opinions. Pro-family parent: Tell me. Why do you want my child in the 5th grade to know that its okay for contraception? Tell me why my 7th grade child should learn various ways to have sex. You tell me why. Pro-LGBT parent: My childs been ostracized since he was 7.

Nobody was intimidated by those tactics. Parent after parent took the podium. They were very firm and direct.

Among the statements directed to the Board by various parents who came forward:

"Why do you insist on using taxpayer dollars to push an illegal curriculum that a majority doesnt want?"

"You should re-vote [on the curriculum] or else resign."

"Why are pornographic materials being used for young children?"

"Does the curriculum teach anywhere that pornography is harmful or addictive?"

Most school boards refuse to answer address any questions from citizens at the meetings. But one mother took the podium and insisted that the Board tell her What medical panel has signed off on the medical accuracy of this curriculum?

As usual, the Board refused to answer. But she kept at it, saying: Taxpayers are owed an answer to this question. This is medically inaccurate. This is indoctrination, not education.

Then she just stood and stared at them.

After several long, silent seconds, the Board superintendent finally answered. We will respond to you in writing. And the Chairman said, Okay, your two minutes are complete. Thank you.

That was a game changer, one of the group leaders told us. The Chairman and the superintendent were visibly rattled by that. (Were waiting to hear if shes received the response yet.) And actually, doing this was outside of that mothers comfort zone. But parents are getting angrier and angrier.

At the beginning of the meeting, the Chairman said that even though they won't re-vote to get rid of the curriculum, in light of the criticism of it they planned to "revise" it:

We do support revisions and modifications to the curriculum and will continue to monitor the implementation now and throughout the school year. The goal is for students to develop healthy and safe relationships.

This is a universal tactic used to placate parents -- to say that they will "modify" the most outrageous parts of the program. But these parents aren't falling for it. It only strengthens their resolve to end it entirely.

Why should anyone believe in that? These same school officials created and approved this horrible program for kids. They cannot be trusted to fix it. And even if they did, our experience has been that it would only be temporary. Eventually it evolves back and eventually becomes even worse than before.

Of course, speaking up at a school board meeting is only a small part of the battle. Most of the fight takes place elsewhere, as we have reported. But there are times you need to make a statement, and this was one of them.

In general, once a school board pulls the trigger to implement an aggressive sexuality program, the pressure is on from the Left to move forward -- and its never allowed to go back.

But on Aug. 24 the rumors that the Board would capitulate were so strong that St. Louis TV reporters were there and the LGBT activists felt the need to converge on the meeting! That shows that the parents are breaking them down.

And trust us, the parents are not stopping. There's more to come from them in this battle that this Board and the hideous LGBT activists wont like at all!

A School Board situation like this can be the most unnerving because you are face to face with people who are pushing things onto vulnerable children, and eventually their families, that can only be described as evil. How does a second-graders mind handle transgenderism? How does a fourth-grader handle explanations of masturbation or homosexuality or sex acts? These people dont care. Its very hard for the average person to come to grips with that.

This past March, the sex-ed curriculum was passed by a 4-3 vote. It was four liberals versus three church-going conservatives. The following month there was an election and one of the liberals was replaced by a new conservative. It would appear that the vote was there to repeal it. But soon after that, the three other conservatives (including the present Chairman) announced they now strongly support the sex-ed curriculum. Something got to them. (The new conservative is the only one left opposing it!) Weve seen that happen before. In this case, it makes the parents even more incensed!

This group of Missouri MassResistance parents is really outstanding, and gets it. After this August 24 meeting, they are growing and have continued to fight this fight very hard. After all, its their children in the crosshairs! We believe they will win this. Well have a lot more to report in the coming weeks!

Public school administrators are ALL evil. Satanically evil. Every single one of them, everywhere, at every level. And most of the teachers, too.

They’re coming after the Children! Turn the US into a third world economy after educating the kids on normalized sex with older folk. Then the kids can support the family.

No idea why we haven’t had assassinations in situations like this.

In a year or two this graphic curriculum will be implemented and no one will think about it anymore. Happens all the time-parents push back against an appalling radical curriculum, policy, etc. The board and administration acts shocked at the push back. They then table it for now, then quietly implement it later and when asked they explain that there are legal requirements they must meet that include implementing the radical curriculum/policy. Parents can’t hire lawyers to investigate the district’s claims or spend years following up on the board’s actions. Meanwhile, the district has a lawyer in retainer and all the time in the world to push their agenda.

Why does anyone think there is a need for sex education in any grade K through 12. One can know everything there is to know about the digestive system and one will still get hungry. You can know every thing about sex and reproduction and the hormones will still flow. These parents are correct. It is not about sex education it is about indoctrination and brainwashing our youth. I have never known a happy LGBT. They are miserable human beings and they seek all the company that they can muster.



To: Saltmeat

Why does anyone think there is a need for sex education in any grade K through 12 I certainly think there is a need for sex education (although not earlier than 7th or 8th grade). IMO, the real issue is whether the sex ed is of the Christian/Darwinian based variety, or the BLTG-Q&A abomination variety. It took me decades to learn how to have a proper relationship with my wife. I feel like my wife and I would have had an even better marriage if someone had explained things to me when I was a teenager rather than making me figure things out on my own. If the sex ed was all about how a good sex life strengthens a long term monogamous relationship, then I think sex education would be a good thing.



To: metmom

Amen and amen. That is the only way to truly stop this kind of evil. Pull the kids out, support Home School legal defense organizations, and starve the beast. But most parents do not care about their children, the school is a babysitter so the parent can have some ME time.

Exactly. I’ve heard parents, supposedly Christian parents at that, say that they can’t wait for school to start so the rugrats can be out from under their feet again. (Their term, nor mine, not ever.) Then these worthless broads ram and roads all day, shopping, going out to lunch, etc. They didn’t work. They just never grew up.

I attended the freak show of a city council meeting in my large city when the push to impose "transgender" bullying was on the docket. Freakish transvestites were allowed to speak all manner of false slander against pro-family folks, but NO ONE was allowed to utter one word which was considered "disparaging" by the sodomites, including "sodomite." It was a stacked agenda from the get-go, and even though the meeting went well into the early morning hours, with pro-family folks outnumbering the freaks, the council voted their pre-determined decision. None of this is "debated" unless the sodomites are sure that they have their objective in the bag.

I tend to agree with j.earl, that kids at the 7th-8th grade level —IOW, puberty— do need factual sex education. But it should be FACTUAL, biology-based education, about how male and female bodies work, for the propagation of the species. Sperm, egg, pregnancy, gestation, childbirth. I am certainly sympathetic to the view that it’s the parents’ job, not the school’s, to teach their kids the birds & bees. But what if the parents are as misinformed as mine were? I was taught a bunch of superstitious “old wives tales” that were just plain wrong, because my mother had been taught the same; she had no answers for my questions beyond “that’s enough, don’t be nasty.” Many parents don’t do “the talk” at all. So there needs to be matter-of-fact basic education on the subject, included in biology class. The LGBT agenda OTOH is pushing “expressing your sexuality” to children, and encouraging sodomy and homosexuality, as well as the notion of “adult allies for LGBT children. Different ways to achieve orgasm, while avoiding pregnancy; abortion and how to get treatment for the inevitable STDs. As if abortion and disease is just normal. It is nothing less than a pedophile agenda. The LGBT sex-ed guidebooks actually say that “sexuality” must focus on “expression” and be completely “nonbinary” (not male and female, but “gender-fluid”) and avoid discussing ANY connection between the sex act’s function pertaining to reproduction and childbirth! Menstrual cycle, ovulation, sperm and ovum? Stages of gestation, baby in the womb, miracle of life? Nope! Not allowed.

Let’s talk about oral and anal! And trans expression! And bullies using the wrong pronouns!

This crap being foisted on our children must be fought with every ounce of fight we have. If we lose on this, we are done.

“A few states passing school vouchers for private schools would stop this nonsense.” Vouchers are a disaster in waiting. Everyone knows that the government will step in to regulate the recipients of the vouchers. Parents can opt out of public schooling immediately, with or without vouchers. It will be more difficult for some, but that is where private organizations would need to fill the void. I would much prefer that if we *must* have government schools, let the state reimburse property and sales taxes to those parents who want to opt their children out. It needn’t be a voucher.

“This crap being foisted on our children must be fought with every ounce of fight we have. If we lose on this, we are done.” Step 1. Remove one’s children from government schools. This has the dual benefit of saving one’s children, as well as denying the school district the funds for that child.

Step 2. Find an alternative (home school, private school, co-op etc)

Step 3. Fight the system as a taxpayer, but without one’s children in the system.
