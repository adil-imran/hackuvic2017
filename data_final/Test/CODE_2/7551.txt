Kenya Airways (KQ) pilots have issued a seven-day strike notice demanding resignation of their chief executive officer and board chairman.

The pilots, through the Kenya Airlines Pilots Association, said the two officials; Mbuvi Ngunze and Dennis Awori respectively, were directly responsible for the massive losses reported.

Mr Ngunze survived in a past strike after senior managers including the Human Resources Director Alban Mwendar resigned.

"No pilots will be flying from 5am next Tuesday," said Paul Gichinga, the association's secretary general, referring to the effective date of October 18.

He added that the resignation of the two officials was only part of their "bare minimum" demands to avert the strike.

He added: "Should they stay on, the airline will definitely die and we will have no jobs." He was accompanied by about 20 pilots and first officers.

Previous strikes by the pilots were mostly to force the airline to improve the working conditions, including offering better salaries.

The association said more than 50 pilots had left the airline and got recruited mostly in Qatar, where salaries are much higher than what KQ pays.

Insiders told The Standard that a captain's salary is about Sh1 million a month.

Implications of the pilots' strike are severe for the ailing company, which might be forced to cancel many travel tickets already issued.

Travellers might also be forced to reschedule their planned trips in and out of the country, affecting many more businesses, including hotels.

Ngunze is serving his first term after his June 2014 appointment to succeed former boss, Titus Naikuni, while Mr Awori was elected chairman in November last year.
