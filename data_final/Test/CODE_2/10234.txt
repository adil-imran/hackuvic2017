President Rodrigo Duterte has a “good feeling” about his upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinpeng, as he expects a bonanza of loans and trade deals from the much-anticipated state visit.

In a speech in Lamitan, Basilan, on Monday, Duterte has promised the residents that the government would be able to make up for its neglect of the war-torn island if he would get a windfall from China in the state visit on October 18-21.

“I have a good feeling that we will be ok with them (China). However, first let’s not touch the Scraborough issue because we cannot win that,” said the president.

He said a key strategy in his Chinese initiative has been not to make an issue of the UN arbitral ruling on the country’s territorial rights in the South China Sea, specifically Scarbrough Shoal where China has reportedly planned to reclaim similar to the artificial island it had built in the disputed Spratlys archipelago.

“Even if we get angry, we’ll just be putting on airs. We can’t beat them. We’ll ask them to allow our fishermen to their traditional fishing grounds in Scarborough,” said the president.

Filipino fishermen have yet to be allowed to return to Scarborough, as China has refused to honour the July 12 decision of the Permanent Court of Arbitration to void China’s maritime claim based on its nine-dash line.

Duterte claimed China has agreed to cooperate in allowing fishermen back to Scarborough Shoal as well as relaxing its quarantine restrictions on banana and pineapple exports to China.

“I have a good feeling they (China) really want to help us in a big way. If I get something big, I promise you, I will build hospitals and schools from the soft-term loans we will get (from China). If there is anything left, I will use it to help you build a power plant,” Duterte emphasised.

The president said the power plant, to be powered by ocean waves, would act as a catalyst for change in the life of the Basilan residents.

“The government has failed you many times,” said Duterte.

The president handed out 10 million Philippine pesos in seed money for livelihood projects of coconut farmers in Lamitan and Isabela in Basilan whose farms were ravaged by pests.

He also handed out 70 motorised, fiberglass fishing boats; seven farm tractors; rice and corn seeds and fertilizers.
