Three former Tesco executives accused of fraud in relation to an accounting scandal at Britain’s biggest supermarket will go on trial next September.

Christopher Bush, the former managing director of Tesco UK, Carl Rogberg, the former finance director of Tesco UK, and John Scouler, the former commercial director for food, appeared at Southwark crown court for a plea and case management hearing on Thursday, when the date for the full trial was set for 4 September 2017.

They are all charged with one count of fraud by abuse of position and one count of false accounting. The three men could face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty of the fraud charge and seven years for false accounting. Their lawyers have said they intended to plead not guilty to the charges.

The allegations relate to a scandal at Tesco that left a £326m hole in its accounts.

The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) launched a criminal investigation into accounting practices at Tesco in October 2014, after the company admitted that it had overstated profits by £263m by incorrectly booking payments from suppliers. It later revised the overstatement up to £326m.

At the previous hearing last month at Westminster magistrates’ court, the three men were accused of abusing their positions as senior employees of the supermarket chain for personal gain. The prosecution accused them of dishonestly falsifying Tesco’s digital accounting records and its draft interim accounts by the “inputting of and/or reliance upon commercial income figures which gave a false account of the financial position of Tesco”.

The SFO investigation into Tesco is continuing and it is possible that more individuals and the company itself could face action. However, it is understood that the former chief executive Philip Clarke, who was questioned under caution by the SFO, will not be charged.

When the SFO announced it had charged the executives last month, Tesco said it continued to cooperate with the investigation. The company said: “The last two years have seen an extensive programme of change at Tesco, but given this is an ongoing legal matter, we are unable to provide any further comment at this time.”

Bush, Rogberg and Scouler will return to court on 30 May next year for a preliminary hearing. All three were released on unconditional bail.
