The suitcase trade of baby formula from Australia to China is winding down after a customs crackdown.

About 40,000 personal shoppers, known as daigou, buy up baby formula, vitamins and Weetbix in Australia to export to middle class buyers in China with a 50 per cent mark up.

But the lucrative trade, which some claimed led to a shortage of baby formula on Australian shelves last year, has been squeezed by a Chinese crackdown, Financial Times reported.

New Chinese customs rules raised import taxes on postal items, consumer goods brought into the country by air passengers and foreign ecommerce transactions.

Beijing will also require international companies to obtain certification for products they wish to sell online.

Accountant Jane Li, who was a daigou on the side, said the 'market has started to cool down'.

The Chinese migrant and her mother sold up to about AU$4,000 a month.

Swisse, a major Australian vitamin and supplement company, said daigou purchases had dropped from more than 100,000 to about 20,000 over the past year.

'New cross-border ecommerce rules introduced in China created uncertainty for daigou and we saw resellers sell off stock to reduce risk,' Michael Howard, Swisse sales director told Financial Times.

Swisse launched in China in March, but was already ranked as the number one online vitamin brand in the Chinese market.

'The launch of its flagship store on the Tmall site will provide Chinese customers with direct access to its range of premium, proven and aspirational wellness products,' the company's statement said in March.

'Over the past 12 months we have we have seen a strong demand for our products from Chinese consumers who regard Australia as a very clean and green country and aspire to adopt our healthy ways,' Swisse CEO Radek Sali said.

Australian supermarkets Coles and Woolworths had been forced to put a purchase limit on baby formula in an attempt to ensure all shoppers who needed the product could buy it

'They also know when they purchase our brand they can trust they are receiving a high-quality, premium and proven product that has been backed by scientific research and adheres to the toughest regulatory regime and quality standards in the world.

Daigou sales are expected to continue to drop in the long term as the price differentiation for quality products between China and Australia reduces.

The trade continues, however, and some companies see daigou as an opportunity to expand their markets.

Daigous have previously capitalised over fear of authenticity and quality in China after a spate of food scandals.
