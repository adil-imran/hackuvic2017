The meat paradox

Science Daily ^ | 10/11/2016 | University of Oslo

Posted on by JimSEA

When we eat beef, chicken wings, hot dogs or spaghetti bolognese, we do it in denial. Already by referring to what we eat as "beef" instead of "cow," we have created a distance between our food and an animal with abilities to think and feel.

The meat paradox

"The presentation of meat by the industry influences our willingness to eat it. Our appetite is affected both by what we call the dish we eat and how the meat is presented to us," says Jonas R. Kunst, a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute of Psychology, University of Oslo.

Kunst and his colleague Sigrid M. Hohle conducted five studies in Norway and the U.S. In the first study, chicken was presented at different processing stages: a whole chicken, drumsticks, and chopped chicken fillets. The scientists measured participants' associations to the animal, and how much empathy they felt with the animal.

In the second study, participants saw pictures of a roasted pork -- one beheaded the other not. The scientists examined their associations to the animal, and to which extent they felt empathy and disgust. They also asked participants whether they wanted to eat the meat or would rather choose a vegetarian alternative.

This article, to my mind, is a completely political bit of nonsense. It's from Norway so likely none of my taxes were wasted on it but American Universities have just as biased or nonsensical crap. I'm retiring to eat my cow burger for dinner along with some murdered veggies that were not allowed to reach maturity to spread their seeds and ensure the next generation.

Someone needs to remind this leftist nitwit what most animals are capable of doing to each other, without any compunction at all.

This is one of the modern issues caused by disregarding theology, and especially Judeo-Christian theology. The idea of a sacrifice becomes less and less meaningful.

Norway has limited their nut cases to the non-STEM Nobel committees. But the infection has spread to their university psychology depts, apparently. Sorry, but that PhD candidate’s degree is equivalent to a good 1950 high school degree.

It is helpful to kill your own meat from time to time. Then you know what you’re up to.

This article proves unequivocally that the West is too rich. A serious society would not undertake such nonsensical “research.” The “postdoctoral fellow at the Institute of Psychology” should drop out and go learn auto mechanics, computer programming, petroleum engineering, or carpentry and do something useful with his life. Can you imagine this schlub getting home from “work” and his husband asking “How was work, today, dear”?



To: rdl6989

With much praise to God for it... What we have here is the contradictory scenario that is left when the Judeo-Christian concept of sacrifice is abandoned. We want to be kind to animals but have no context for it, and if not very careful we will be cruel to humans in the name of kindness to animals.

I did a quick check on Google translate and it looks like Norwegian follows the German method of naming meat. Storfekjøtt og svinekjøtt mean cattle meat and pig meat.

What ridiculous nonsense-what do they eat in Norway if not meat? It is too damn cold to grow most of the veggies we have here... I live in the country and was brought up on my family’s small working ranch-I’ve helped with plucking, gutting and butchering from an early age-dead chickens, pigs and cows are still delicious-and I have fresh-killed spinach and a chicken I bartered with a neighbor for to put on the grill right now-it was walking around just yesterday-yummy...

The French use the same word for “beef” and “bullock”. Are they vegetarians? Apart from that, the authors seem to confuse squeamishness with moral insight.

To: JimSEA

Already by referring to what we eat as "beef" instead of "cow," we have created a distance between our food and an animal with abilities to think and feel. Bullshit. Beef == le boeuf == bullock or steer (the animal from which the meat comes) in French. Pork == le porc = pig in French. Chicken? Duck? Goose? Lamb? Mutton == le mouton == sheep in French. The author is simply wrong.

For the love of algore. Beef is the edible part of the cow, cow is the entire thing, bones, hooves and hide. Pork is the edible part of the pig, mutton is the edible part of the sheep and so on and so forth.

I eat steer, not cow, specifically white-faced Black Angus steer. His name was George. George is tasty. Cows are for milking and making steers, and the older ones are only good to be ground up for burger. Steers are better for eatin'.

Pig strips... Thin crunchy pig strips with aborted fowl in the morning is as yummy as it gets and frankly, I could care less what they call it... I’m eating my pig strips and aborted fowl. Later on, I’ll have me some cow in steak format, or maybe some ground up innards in cylindrical shape with some mustard on top. Food is yummy, meat is yummy... Alpalpha sprouts are cow food. The cow eats the sprouts and then we eat the cow... That’s how I get my veggies.

English is strange. Because of the Norman invasion you have a lot of old English words for the animals raised by peasant farmers and old French words for the meat.

“...by referring to what we eat as “beef” instead of “cow,” “ This comes from the snobbery of the Normans after they took over England. The Normans were Frenchified Vikings. Someone explained it thusly: On a plate on a table with a glass of wine, food was referred to by its French name: beef, mutton, poultry. Standing in a field covered with sh!t, it was called cow, sheep, chicken.

old French words for the meat. But in the French, the words mean both the animal and the meat from it. So the peasants who raised the animals used Saxon words, and the Froggish nobility who ate it used the French words.

When cows are unable to either give milk or make baby cows they become beef. Did you think they had cow retirement homes?

Good article! Our meat consumption was justified originally in the sacrifice of Yom Kippur. Without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sin! Is this all just more of the attack on the word of YHVH?

The people from Grit slaughtered a “COW.” You were so smart you didn’t even notice that “nonsensical” act.

Actually, very little ‘cow’ meat ever becomes human food. The reason is that they are taken when “down,” thus not able to acquire the USDA stamp.

Is that anything like having a cow which this idiot appears to be doing.



To: NorthMountain; JimSEA

Right, NorthMOuntain. As far as I know, using diffeent words for the edible product and the animal only occurs in English, and it has nothing to do with psychological dissociation. Why? It’s because of the Norman Conquest (1066 AD). The Norman invaders spoke French, the Anglo-Saxons natives Old English, a variety of West Germanic. The Normans were the gentry. The Anglo-Saxons were the peasants. Thus the Anglo-Saxons raised and slaughtered cows, calves, pigs, chickens (all Saxon-German derived words) and when it was served at the gentry’s table, it was termed beef, veal, pork, poultry (all Norman-French derived.) The mystery revealed. Go back to school, ya dumb bumpkins from the University of Oslo.
