Ras Al Khaimah: A plan to fully achieve the National Agenda’s goals by 2021 was approved yesterday (Sunday) by the UAE Cabinet.

The team was set up during an extraordinary Cabinet meeting held at Shaikha Fatima Bint Mubarak School in Ras Al Khaimah.

A number of top students in the UAE attended the meeting chaired by His Highness Shaikh Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai.

As part of the plan, 36 governmental teams comprising 550 officials will be responsible for ensuring the implementation of the rest of the goals set by the National Agenda 2021. A number of workshops will be held starting next week to increase awareness among officials on the agenda’s goals and mechanisms for achieving them.

Shaikh Mohammad stressed that his address to the nation concerning the National Agenda aims to establish transparency between the people and government. “The National Agenda 2021 is a summary of the objectives of governmental work and the goals we have set for the happiness of our people. It will be a priority and the focus of governmental work during the coming period,” said Shaikh Mohammad. The Vice-President said that he is optimistic that the goals will be achieved before 2021.

Shaikh Mohammad issued directives for regularly publishing government performance reports in the media in order to consolidate the concept of transparency and accountability. Shaikh Mohammad granted the National Agenda team the authority to recruit any federal government employee in order to achieve its goals.

Addressing top students who attended the meeting, Shaikh Mohammad said: “Your presence here emphasises the commitment of Cabinet members to work for your benefit and your future. I was keen on inviting you so you can witness how the Cabinet works as a team to build the future of citizens. All the Cabinet members are here today to serve you and Emiratis, and to create an environment in which you can achieve your aspirations and dreams.”

“Everyone in the UAE has a duty that they must fulfil. Your duty is to excel in your studies and education. We are working for your interests, but you have to work for yourselves as well. Focus on your studies and maintain the UAE’s achievements,” added Shaikh Mohammad.

During the meeting, the Cabinet approved setting up the UN women liaison office for the Gulf Cooperation Council in Abu Dhabi. It also approved the Federal National Council’s request to discuss a number of topics and policies. It also approved a framework agreement between the UAE and the US in the field of air navigation, exploration, and the use of airspace and outer space for peaceful purposes. It also approved four agreements in the field of economy and five agreements in the field of aviation services.

Later, His Highness Shaikh Saud Bin Saqr Al Qasimi, Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah, hosted a lunch banquet in honour of Shaikh Mohammad, marking the occasion of the Cabinet meeting being held in Ras Al Khaimah.
