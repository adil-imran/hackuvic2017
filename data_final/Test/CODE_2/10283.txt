The GMB union has launched a campaign to save the UK's nightclubs from closure.

The organisation's London youth wing says it'll be organising demonstrations over the next six weeks after Fabric was shut down in September.

An appeal will be heard by Highbury Magistrates Court on 28 November after its licence was revoked.

Islington councillors said there was a "culture of drugs" at the venue after police asked for it to be shut down.

It followed the deaths of two teenagers from suspected drug overdoses who'd attended Fabric.

But Ryan Maynes from the GMB Union says too many clubs are being forced to close, especially in London, and too many key night workers are losing their jobs.

"With the introduction of the night tube, young people should be enthused at London becoming a truly 24-hour city, yet with closures like these young people will have nowhere to go."

On Saturday, #SaveNightlife campaign supporters, organised by online music platform MEOKO, marched from Hoxton to London Fields for a rally in protest at the closure of Fabric and other clubs.

Chairman of the Night Time Industries Association, Alan Miller, has told Newsbeat that he wants what he calls "the silent majority" to tell politicians how annoyed they are with the closure of clubs.

"Nightlife is really important," he said. "Everybody talks about crime and anti-social behaviour.

"They don't talk about the places where we meet one another, get inspired and make new friends, create huge cultural capital, fashion, music, film and fall in love.

"This march is really to say, 'Look, we're concerned about some of the things that have happened. We've got to get a grip on the value of nightlife to Britain, to London and the 24-hour city, particularly as we're celebrating the new 24-hour tubes.'"

Elliot Starr, 26, from Canterbury, has been going to Fabric for years and says he and his mates are gutted.

"It's a wider problem than just Fabric," he says. "It's a problem within society, not just the club.

"We've all been to the club and we think it's really unfair that's it's been shut down. It's completely unjust.

"We feel bad that other people won't be able to experience it and a lot of people are also losing their jobs."

Last month the Metropolitan police denied having a grudge against Fabric during a discussion from the venue's premises.

The co-founder and director of the club, Cameron Leslie, told Radio 1 DJ B Traits that they'd "put some noses out of joint" by winning a previous decision about licensing restrictions.

But Islington Council Leader Richard Watts says he'd prefer to be able to keep Fabric open.

"We completely understand Fabric's cultural importance," he said.

"[But] the committee did not feel confident that Fabric was a safe place that was doing everything in its power to stop crime and keep its patrons safe."
