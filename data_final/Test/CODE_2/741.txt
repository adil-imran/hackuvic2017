The Wolf Of Wall Street star recently pulled out of hosting a Hillary Clinton fundraiser in Los Angeles because he was busy trying to get the film ready in time for its Toronto premiere. Justin Timberlake and wife Jessica Biel instead stepped in to host the Clinton bash at the last minute.

But there were suggestions Leo pulled out of the hosting gig as questions were raised over his Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation's links to a multi-billion-dollar embezzlement scandal in Malaysia.

Leonardo took to social media on Friday to share his excitement at finally unveiling the finished film.

'Looking forward to sharing this documentary with everyone as we continue to act on #climatechangetogether,' he tweeted.

When actor and fellow activist Mark Ruffalo tweeted his congrats on what he called a 'huge and historic production,' the Titanic star replied: 'Appreciate the support. Looking forward to sharing the documentary with everyone.'

Leo also posted a behind-the-scenes photo from filming with marine ecologist and National Geographic explorer-in-residence Enric Sala on Instagram Friday.

' Filming 'Before the Flood' was an incredible experience & today's screening of the documentary at #TIFF16 is an honor,' the Los Angeles native wrote.

'This photo was taken during our filming in the #Arctic with @EnricSala.'

Learning: The Revenent star shared a behind-the-scenes photo on Instagram on Friday, calling making the film 'an incredible experience'

The Revenent star also shared a clip from the film, which shows him observing and listening to a pod of Arctic narwhals, a whale known for its unicorn-like horn.

'I can't believe what they sound like, it's amazing,' the actor marvels in the clip. 'They're like purring.'

'I don't want to be in a planet without these animals,' his companion adds.

Looking sharp: Leo looked stylish in a navy suit and light shirt

The actor sported an extremely bushy beard and a puffy North Face jacket, beanie and sunglasses while filming in the freezing Arctic.

But the handsome star went for a far more polished look as he arrived at the festival Friday, beaming and chatting with fans as he headed to the premiere.

Not by his side for the film's debut was his model girlfriend Nina Agdal, 24, who has been busy in New York for Fashion Week.

Star power The actor stopped to sign autographs for fans on his way into the venue

Leo has long been an environmental activist, even urging action to save the planet in his Oscars speech after winning Best Actor last year.

'Climate change is real. It is happening right now. It's the most urgent threat facing our entire species and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating,' he said from the Academy Awards stage in February.

The actor - who was named a UN Messenger of Peace with a focus on climate change in 2014 - also addressed the United Nations in April, where he urged world leaders to act.

He has also donated millions to environmental and scientific causes including protecting tigers and studying the oceans through his Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation over the years.

However, his foundation has recently come under scrutiny for a lack of transparency after being linked to a Malaysian financial scandal.

The Department of Justice believes multiple donations to Leonardo DiCaprio's foundation came from a money laundering scandal by Malaysian playboy and businessman Jho Low, 35, who was a friend of the recent Oscar winner, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Low is alleged to have used stolen money from a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund called 1MDB to spend at DiCaprio's lavish charity auctions. There is no suggestion the actor was aware of the source of the funds.

And Leo has also been criticized as hypocritical by some fans because of his fondness for private airplane travel and luxury yachts while preaching against fossil fuels.
