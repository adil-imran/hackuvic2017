Technology can inspire and enhance learning through innovation, collaboration & creativity.

This is the tech vision statement for VIS in Laos, where I had the pleasure of working with a lovely group of educators for several days last week. It is also the central idea for their inquiry into the use of technology for innovation in learning.

Our provocations included, among other things:

an exploration of the difference between enhancing and inspiring, which stimulated interesting conversation, not just about technology (which isnâ€™t really the point) but about learning.

looking at examples of collaboration and creativity to inspire possibilities.

investigation of the 2016 ISTE standards for students.

creating stop motion clips to encapsulate the big ideas within the standards.

consideration of how the characteristics of the innovatorâ€™s mindset might influence teachersâ€™ approach to technology integration.

individual and team meetings exchanging ideas and thinking collaboratively.

Their ongoing inquiry involves putting ideas into practice, making connections, experimenting, investigating, exploring furtherâ€¦ bringing the vision to life.

Graham was inspired to start a blog. His first post challenges us to consider whether the PYP exhibition is actually an expedition. Year 6s in Australia have already been inspired to pursue the question. Some of them might like to connect with Grahamâ€™s students in Laosâ€¦

Linda sent out a tweet asking for photos of learning spaces around the world to help her Preps gather data for their inquiry into learning environments and received, among other global contributions, images of the early years learning spaces at my school.

Olwenâ€™s class created stop motion animations of their own migrations and put out a request for people to share their migration stories via these google slides. My school community will be invited to add theirs â€“ would anyone in my network network like to contribute?

Some of the take-aways:

Itâ€™s not about the technology, itâ€™s ALWAYS about the learning.

The tools have to work for us, we donâ€™t work for them.

Try one new thing.. but not just for the sake of it.

Know your purpose!

Extend the learning into the wider world.

You donâ€™t have to know everything. Let the learners take the lead.

Collaboration and creativity donâ€™t depend on technologyâ€¦

but technology can take them to another level.

Innovation is a mindsetðŸ™‚

I already love the flow on from connecting with these teachers and the way their tech vision statement is embodied in our ongoing collaboration.
