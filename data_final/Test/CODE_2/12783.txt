TOKYO?Three former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Co. were indicted Monday over the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, a sign of public anger that no one had been charged with a crime over the biggest nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.

Court-appointed lawyers acting as prosecutors charged former Tepco chairman Tsunehisa Katsumata and the former heads of the utility's nuclear division, Sakae Muto and Ichiro Takekuro, with professional negligence resulting in death and injury.

The criminal charges were the first to result from the disaster, five years after a 13.1 meter tsunami swamped the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, triggering meltdowns at three of the plant's six reactors. Tepco knew it was possible the plant could be hit by a tsunami bigger than it was designed to withstand, but made cost saving a higher priority than long-term safety, the prosecuting lawyers said in the indictment.

The executives are expected to plead not guilty. They have repeatedly said the possibility of such a massive tsunami was unrealistic.

Legal experts say they are likely to be acquitted, with the onus on the prosecution to prove that failure to protect the power plant from a tsunami was an act of criminal oversight.

Prosecutors had twice decided not to indict the executives, saying it was impossible to charge them with criminal negligence for failing to take immediate action based on the unlikely threat of such an unusually large tsunami over the long term.

Citizen panels twice challenged that decision, arguing that nuclear plant operators should prepare even for unlikely natural disasters, and that Tepco should have considered shutting down the plant until adequate safety measures had been taken.

The second committee's decision was binding, requiring the appointment of independent prosecutors to try the case.

Many Japanese are still angry about the Fukushima disaster, blaming Tepco and the government for both the accident itself and the way it has been handled.

Nearly 100,000 people have been prevented from returning to their homes as entire towns around the plant have become temporary dumping grounds for radiation-contaminated soil. Communities have been destroyed and families torn apart.

The nuclear meltdowns sent Tepco to the brink of bankruptcy, requiring a ¥ 1 trillion ($8.77 billion) government bailout. Tepco plans to spend about ¥ 2 trillion on the daunting task of decommissioning the plant, and has paid ¥ 5.9 trillion in compensation to residents so far.

The compensation has done little to cool people's anger.

"Tepco won't acknowledge that they are the perpetrators," said Ruiko Muto, one of 1,324 Fukushima residents who filed the original criminal complaint against 42 Tepco executives and government officials in 2012. "We hope the court proceedings will show that executives had years to take action against the tsunami, but did nothing."

The crux of the legal battle ahead is Tepco's internal calculation in 2008 that a 15.7-meter tsunami could hit the plant, based on a projection by a government earthquake research body. Tepco has argued in court that the risk of such a tsunami was so low that it was outside the realm of realistic possibilities.

According to the indictments, the victims of Tepco's decision include 13 people?employees and members of Japan's Self-Defense Forces?who were exposed to rubble from two hydrogen explosions, and 44 patients who died while being evacuated from a nearby hospital to avoid the fallout.

Tepco is also fighting a class-action suit filed by a group of shareholders.

The criminal trial won't start for about a year, due to the amount of documents that need to be vetted by both sides, according to Shozaburo Ishida, one of the court-appointed lawyers.
