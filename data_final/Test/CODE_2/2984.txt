A 12-year-old girl has become pregnant after she was allegedly trafficked to rural China then sold into a forced marriage.

She was confirmed to be three months pregnant after being taken to the a hospital in Xuzhou last week accompanied by two adults, reported People's Daily Online.

After speaking to the girl in private, shocked doctors suspected she had been a victim of human trafficking and called the police, who have arrested the two adults.

The girl, known as Lan Lan, was taken to the Xuzhou Central Hospital in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, on October 4 by 35-year-old Liu, who had reportedly paid around 30,000 yuan (£3,600) for her to be his wife.

Apart from Liu, a 47-year-old woman was also accompanying the couple.

The woman, surnamed Xie, was thought to be the person who had sold her as a bride to Liu.

Liu and Xie told the doctors that Lan Lan was 20 years old, and this raised the suspicion from the doctors.

An obstetrician at the hospital told local television station JSTV: 'She has not hit puberty. Her appearance did not match the claim of her age.'

Hospital staff asked Liu and Xie to provide identity documents to prove Lan Lan's age, but they failed to do so.

During a one-on-one consultation, t he girl told doctors that she was originally from Vietnam.

However, doctors said she could also be saying 'southern China' as they did not understand her accent clearly.

Liu and Xie were reportedly feeling impatient while waiting for Lan Lan.

One of the adults threatened to 'bomb the hospital because the doctor had asked too many questions', the report said.

Seeing this, staff at the hospital alerted the police, who brought Liu, Xie and Lan Lan back to the police station for questioning.

Police officers in Quanshan, Xuzhou city, said Lan Lan was an overseas citizen, according to a post on their Weibo page on October 4.

They said they were still looking into her identity.

Several Chinese media, including The Paper, reported that the 12 year-old girl were sold by Vietnamese human traffickers to a rural village called Mei Zhai in Henan in 2014.

She was later adopted by 47 year-old Xie, who lives in the Tongshan district of Xuzhou city, reports said.

Last summer, Xie sold the girl to 35-year-old Liu and was paid £3,600.

Xie has been arrested under the suspicion of abducting and selling women and children while Liu has been arrested for buying kidnapped women and children.

Article 240 of China's criminal law states that whoever abducts and traffics a woman or a child shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than five years and not more than ten years, and concurrently be sentenced to a fine, according to the country's Ministry of Justice.
