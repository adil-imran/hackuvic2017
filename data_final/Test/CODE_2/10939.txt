AMRITSAR: Eight Indian youths have landed in Basra jail of Iraq after being "sold" by unscrupulous travel agents in India. They have now appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj to help them "before it is too late".One of the victims, Inderjeet Singh, a resident of Ambala in Haryana, contacted TOI on Monday. He said that they had paid Rs 2 lakh each to a travel agent for getting a job in Dubai "However, when we reached Dubai airport on July 24, one of travel agent's accomplices threatened us that if we didn't board a plane to Iraq then we will be arrested and jailed for long," he said. They were taken to Iraq on the same day.Those lodged in the Basra jail include: Tarsem Mashi of Gurdaspur; Tirupati Reddy and Durgam Anjaiya of Telangana; Raju Singh, Mir Kesar and Satwant Kumar Singh of Bihar; Azad Ansari of Devaria (Uttar Pradesh); and Inderjit.Inderjit said that he took help of a kind-hearted Iraqi policemen who allowed them to use his mobile phone and internet to seek help. He said he had heard of Modi's 'Mann Ki Baat' and wanted the PM him to take up the issue of people like them who inadvertently fall prey to greedy travel agents who, unscrupulously trade others' lives for money."Once in Iraq, we were kept at some unknown location. After a few days, we all were surprised when we came to know that we were being sold $1500 each. When we resisted being traded like animals, we were implicated in some case and sent to jail," he said. They have been in jail for nearly two months now.Inderjit alleged that two travel agents, named Javed and Chaurasia, were operating from India and had sold them in Iraq.The youth from Haryana said that they had also heard of foreign minister Swaraj taking note of people's plight when contacted on twitter. "We have also tweeted to her but to no avail, even our embassy has refused to help us," he said.He added that three of the jailed youths need urgent medial help as they were subjected to torture.
