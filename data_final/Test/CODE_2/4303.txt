THIS refers to the report ‘Saarc summit put off indefinitely’ (Oct 1) and your editorial ‘Regional isolation?’ (Oct 2). Following in the footsteps of India and several other South Asian countries, Sri Lanka, too, pulled out of the forthcoming Saarc summit meeting in Islamabad, regretfully while repeating New Delhi’s mantra, “... (Sri Lanka) condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and stresses, in this regard, the need to deal with terrorism in the region in a decisive manner.”

Given the fact that Pakistan has had a big role to play in helping Colombo root out Tamil Tigers’ terrorism that had kept Sri Lanka in its stranglehold for a quarter century, it is very painful to see Colombo indirectly accuse Islamabad of fomenting terror. Stories in the media had said that Pakistan had supplied Al-Khalid main battle tanks; its fighter pilots flew an air strike mission on LTTE bases and it positioned some of its highly-trained army officers in Colombo. All of this played a key role in the Sri Lankan rout of Tamil Tigers. Now, they are slandering Pakistan.

At the very least, Colombo could have just stayed silent over its participation in the summit, since it wasn’t going to be held anyway; or at the most simply notified it would not be able to attend the summit, in as many words. But the way they did it amounts to adding insult to injury.

It is obvious all Saarc members were under tremendous Indian pressure to abstain, but even the tiny Maldives, with just 370,000 inhabitants, didn’t yield to it which is a lesson for others. Bhutan, being a landlocked nation of 785,000 souls, could hardly be expected to defy New Delhi.

Colombo has stabbed its benefactor in the back. Somebody had said, “The unthankful heart ... discovers no mercies.” Islamabad, which had been willing to sell the JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft to Colombo, is advised to review the decision because a Sri Lanka government so beholden to India may ask India to evaluate the technical specifications of these planes.
