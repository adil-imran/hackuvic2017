A Brit plane passenger was removed from a transatlantic flight by US cops after reportedly downing a dozen miniature bottles of wine.

The 24-year-old, believed to be from Glasgow, was detained over his behaviour on a British Airways flight from London to Orlando which had to be diverted to Boston.

Furious passengers said after the flight took off from Gatwick, the man necked a succession of miniature bottles of wine before staggering around the plane saying he wanted to get off.

The Scottish Daily Record reports one onlooker took a photo minutes before the man was frogmarched onto the Tarmac.

In a recording of a radio conversation with ground control, the pilot can be heard saying: “We are going to have to divert our plane to Boston."

“We have an abusive passenger on board and as a result of his behaviour we are requesting a diversion in the next few minutes towards Boston," he continued.

“He is intoxicated at the moment. His behaviour is highly unpredictable."

Massachusetts State Police yesterday said a passenger was still being held by customs officials over disruptive behaviour on the flight.

A spokesman said: “He has not been arrested. He was taken off the plane as an unruly passenger after the flight was diverted.

“He is in the custody of our federal border protection agency and they will put him on a plane to the UK. We believe his departure flight will be tomorrow.

“He will not appear in court today though we may summons him to appear at a later date to answer to a charge of interfering with a flight crew.”

US Customs and Border Protection said privacy laws prevented them from revealing the passenger’s identity unless he had been criminally charged.

A spokesman said: “The subject is currently in CBP custody pending further investigation and possible prosecution.”

The incident cames as the US prepares to mark the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 atrocities.

One passenger said he watched the Scot drink steadily for several hours.

He said: “I was sitting three seats from him and he drank 12 to 14 small bottles of wine and one vodka – all given to him by cabin crew in the first three-and-a-half hours of the flight.

“While the gentleman was totally out of order and a danger to staff and customers around him, BA should shoulder most of the blame.

“I wrote this on the witness statement I was asked to write.

“People around him suffered for the majority of the flight due to the amount of alcohol served.”

Another passenger, Ivor Eathorne, said: “He wanted off the flight. At some stages he didn’t realise he was on a plane.

“They had to escort him back to his seat and physically keep him in his seating area.”

The pilot even spoke to the drunken Scot personally before deciding to divert the flight.

Passenger Mark Christie, 30, from Aberdeen, said: “Eventually the guy needed to be baby-sat by two cabin crew at a time.

“Then the pilot came through to try and calm him down but he obviously decided it was better to land in Boston.”

A BA spokeswoman said: “Our customers and crews deserve to enjoy their flights and not to suffer any form of abuse.

“Disruptive behaviour will not be tolerated and the appropriate action will always be taken.

“We’d like to apologise for the delay to the other customers on the flight.”
