Oct. 10 -- San Diego City College will hold a workshop to help former ITT Technical Institute students explore their educational options on Wednesday.

The for-profit college abruptly closed last month, leaving many students who were enrolled unsure about their future education.

The workshop will provide free academic and financial counseling for the former students and is scheduled for 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the City College Corporate Education Center , 1551 C St. Parking is available in the adjacent parking garage on 16th Street between C Street and Broadway .

San Diego City, Mesa, and Miramar colleges, along with San Diego Continuing Education, have been opening their doors to the estimated 460 local ITT Technical Institute students who have been adversely affected by the school's abrupt closure after it was barred from enrolling new students using government loans.

The community college district offers more than 500 degree and certificate programs, many similar to ITT offerings, including writing and computational skills for business, health information technology, management and team building, information technology management and small business management.

At $46 per unit, community college tuition is a fraction of the cost ITT Technical Institute students had paid.

Because ITT Technical Institute was not regionally accredited, the college district cannot accept credits transferred from the school.

"The San Diego Community College District is doing everything it can to get former ITT Tech students back on track and on their way toward securing a certificate or a degree," said Lynn Neault , the district's vice chancellor of student services.

The Wednesday workshop will include sessions on tuition recovery, financial aid, veterans' benefits and academic program alternatives.

California community colleges have participated in more than two dozen outreach meetings with former ITT Technical Institute students affected by the chain's sudden closure and assisted more than 600 students at these events.

In addition, the California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office is working with the U.S. Department of Education in hosting a series of webinars for students affected by the closure of ITT.
