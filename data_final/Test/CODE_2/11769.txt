Biggest demo in decades pressures Venezuela president

Demonstrators dressed in white marched in the east of the capital, yelling "Venezuela is hungry" and "This government is going to fall

Opponents of Venezuelan President claimed to have mobilised a million demonstrators in the biggest rally in decades, demanding a referendum on removing him from power.

Police deployed in their hundreds yesterday to keep apart anti-government protesters angry at food and medicine shortages from Maduro's supporters who vowed to defend his "socialist revolution."

The rallies raised fears of violence in the oil-rich state, where anti-government protests in 2014 led to clashes with police that left 43 people dead.

The leader of the opposition Democratic Unity Roundtable, Jesus Torrealba, told AFP it was the "biggest rally in recent decades" with "between 950,000 and 1.1 million people" taking part.

Demonstrators dressed in white marched in the east of the capital, yelling " is hungry" and "This government is going to fall."

"We either come out to march or we will die of hunger. We are no longer afraid of the government," said one demonstrator, Ana Gonzalez, 53.

The rallies come at a highly volatile time for Venezuela, where a plunge in prices for oil exports has caused shortages, violent crime and outbreaks of looting.

"This is a historic march. Today begins a definitive stage in this struggle," Torrealba said.

Thousands of Maduro supporters in red t-shirts and caps meanwhile rallied in the central Plaza Bolivar yelling to their leader: "The people are with you."

Maduro estimated his supporters' turnout at up to 30,000.

"Today we have defeated a coup d'etat," he told the crowd. "They have failed once again. The victory is ours."

The opposition blames Maduro for the economic crisis and wants a referendum on removing him from power. He has branded the effort a right-wing "coup."

"We are here at the call of our president, to defend the revolution," said 37-year-old housewife at the pro-government rally.

The authorities arrested three opposition leaders in the days ahead of the march. Senior opposition figure said on Thursday that two mayors had also been arrested.

No major clashes were reported during Thursday's marches, which finished in the mid-afternoon, though riot cops faced off with small groups of protesters.
