Earlier today, Purvi Patel, a 35-year-old Indiana woman previously convicted of feticide, was released from prison. According to Indiana Department of Correction spokesman Doug Garrison, Patel walked out of Indiana Women’s Prison in Indianapolis around 10 a.m. with family members.

Patel was arrested in 2013 and charged with feticide, and sentenced to 20 years in prison. In July, this conviction was overturned, while upholding the lesser charge of child neglect. Yesterday, a judge resentenced Patel to 18 months in prison—which is more time than she had already served—and ordered her immediate release.

Patel’s attorney, Lawrence Marshall, a Stanford University law professor, said Patel is “very, very joyful that this day has come,” but that she now needs privacy. “For right now, she needs to recover from what is obviously a traumatic several years. She has to take her life and try to make something meaningful out of all the wreckage that got her here.”

In July 2013, Patel was arrested after she allegedly took medication she purchased online to induce her own abortion before throwing the one and a half pound fetus in the trash behind her family’s restaurant. She was arrested after seeking medical attention for profuse bleeding. Patel claimed that she had a miscarriage and that she was bleeding so profusely that she was in shock for 10-15 minutes. The fetus would have needed medical care within a minute of its birth to have any chance of surviving.

Patel was charged with feticide (a class A felony) and negligence of a dependent (a class D felony). In 2014, Patel was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the higher felony charge of feticide. In 2015, the court responded to Patel’s appeal, upholding the charges due to “sufficient evidence.” However, this year, the Indiana court of Appeals overturned the feticide conviction, ultimately leading to Patel’s release today.

Although asserting that Patel should have never been imprisoned, the case’s resolution is a victory for reproductive rights and social justice advocates—especially in Indiana. The only two instances in which the state’s feticide law has been used against women was against Asian women who were pregnant. In both cases, including Patel’s, the state argued that a pregnant woman could be charged for killing her own fetus. In a previous ruling for this case, the Indiana court of appeals asserted that the law’s use—since it went into effect in 1979—is only meant to prosecute those who harm pregnant women.

South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT), which submitted an amicus brief with dozens of South Asian community partners in support of Patel, was joyful at the case’s latest turn.

“We are thrilled to hear that Purvi Patel is set to be released from prison after having been wrongly convicted of feticide,” SAALT said in a statement on their Facebook page. “We acknowledge that her journey to heal will be long, therefore, we continue to stand with Purvi Patel and others who were met with stigma and stereotyping in times of much-needed care.”
