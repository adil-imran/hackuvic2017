Romeny wants Trump to lose this race and then go, “See we should not have nominated Trump.”

.@dansenor Writing about #BillyBush tapes, hearing your wife (ex NBC) got a hold of tapes and you pushed the story for your boss. Comment?

To: Sybeck1

Ok, but where did SHE get it from? Who knew such a tape existed?



To: Democrats hate too much

Romeny & Ryan have made sure that no true conservative will ever support them. They can rot.



To: SE Mom

Taping may have been illegal is both parties did not know. but like the IRS papers, like Benghazi, like election fraud, like HASAN still being protected, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MATTER?

AND he's a Romney and Ryan guy. Total neocon.

Romney Ryan guy Do you have more detail than that? I probably speak for a lot of FReepers when I ask: Who exactly are these people who initially pushed the Trump tape?

Campbell Brown was a reporter wasn’t she?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Senor Helen Senor’s father was murdered at the Auschwitz concentration camp. After the war, Helen and her mother fled to Paris, then via New York to Montreal. Senor said that his mother’s post-Holocaust trauma “was very heavy for us growing up”. I am stunned that he would side with HC.



To: Sybeck1

Bush guy with ties to Bill Kristol. The Bush family is absolute scum. They are finished in Republican politics for all time.

Yup. Looks like an attempted coup on the gop side. The “I’m shocked, SHOCKED!” Response was too well orchestrated.

I’ve noticed that most Jews and Mormons hate Trump.

It doesn’t much matter what the national audience thinks - ryan has strong support in his home state. Even though what he does and how he acts (or doesn’t act) affects us profoundly.....we don’t matter.

To: boycott

If Trump loses, the party is dead. A record number of patriotic Americans gave trump the nomination. We are being disenfranchised by our own party and a corrupt media. Do they think we will believe in the system any longer to ever bother to ever vote in future elections? The media has,effectively destroyed our political process.



To: MNDude

This is a Romney/Bush coup. Did you see that Paul Ryan was in the audience last night at the debate? I bet he wasn’t a happy camper when Trump wiped the floor with Clinton

To: donna

Traitors.

To: Flycatcher

The question I have is who kept the tape and knew how to find it? Who keeps recordings for a dozen years, just in case they enter politics?

To: bob_esb

Stunned? You do know how 70-80% of Jews vote and how most in the media appear? And you’re stunned They think German descended Trump is Hitlerian Sometimes things are really complicated It’s just how this easy Examine the media collusion in Al Frankens upper west side apt in 2000 to help Kerry Or the Journal-List scandal in 2008.... You know how it is when you see a bad predatory street crime and figure 95% it’s a black perp It’s the same preponderance of proclivity for progressivism

” .... we dont matter.” — That is unless the clown ever thinks about being on a national ticket. Then we matter. And John Boehner got dumped too.



To: maggief; All

https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=dan+senor&s=typd&x=0&y=0 Interesting tweets at link. Meanwhile, for those too young or just not watching much back then...Campbell Brown was a infobabe reporter in various networks for years. Still around ? Dunno. She married Dan Sensor, a bigtime neocon and guy who promoted Iraq war heavily..part of Bush administration. Later advised Romney and maybe Ryan? A very connected couple.



To: BunnySlippers

The media will ignore it Today they are pretending Trump just did fair And Fox is almost all anti Trumpers

Thanks.

Got no faith in Cernovich.

From wiki - dan senor :After Romney lost the November election to Obama, Senor’s criticism of leading Republicans for being fair-weather friends to the candidate, cheering him as “iconic” before the election and “eviscerating” him afterward, was widely reported.



To: jersey117

The media and much of the GOP establishment

To: sissyjane

Romney/Bush/Ryan...three devils every bit as putrid and corrupt as the she-devil herself. They need to go down...forever. And never be able to come back.



To: donna

Her father is a convicted former insurance commissioner (D) in Louisiana

Her marrying a republican new is bizarre- they would not be considered conservative.



To: Jonty30

The Romney cabal probably have watched tens of thousands hours of tape looking for something

To: BunnySlippers

Something is happening. Is Soros or others providing secret Swiss money? Why would Repubs be so self-destructing. I don’t get it - I cheer for my Buffalo Bills no matter how bad they are - it is from my heart/soul. If this is true, how can people betray their families and their party so quickly ...



To: BunnySlippers

Just looking at it seems like a nightmare! It looks more like a window into the "lets see if we can wreck the Republican Party" committee workroom. Senor retweets Kristol, Romney, Brett Stephens, Steve Rattner and other weasels.



To: jersey117

Yep. The media and the two parties have destroyed the process.



To: Scott from the Left Coast

Is Preibus in on it????

How do you not know you have a mic clipped on you?



To: Sybeck1

The vile Campbell and her Scum Husband dud Paul Ryan ‘s dirty work.. Paul needs to be forced to resign . He betrayed his party . He needs to be removed today . R Prebius should demand Ryan resign immediately . Ryan should be forced to resign . He will kill the GOP house chances .
