SINGAPORE, Oct 11 — Singapore’s central bank today shut down a second Swiss bank in the city-state and fined banks DBS and UBS in its biggest crackdown on alleged money-laundering activities connected with Malaysian sovereign fund 1MDB.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said in a statement it had ordered Zurich-based Falcon Private Bank’s Singapore branch to cease operating because of “a persistent and severe lack of understanding” of Singapore’s money-laundering controls. It also accused Falcon’s senior management in Switzerland and Singapore of “improper conduct”.

In Zurich, the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (Finma), ordered Falcon to turn over 2.5 million Swiss francs (RM10.5 million) in what the watchdog said were illegal profits.

It also said it has opened enforcement proceedings against two former Falcon executives, without citing them by name.

Singapore authorities arrested the Singapore branch manager of Falcon Private Bank, Jens Sturzenegger, on Oct 6, MAS said.

Falcon’s owner, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign fund International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC), is not selling the bank “at this moment in time”, Falcon Chief Executive Walter Berchtold told a media briefing.

MAS said it is working closely with Swiss financial watchdog Finma to oversee an orderly closure of Falcon Bank in Singapore.

DBS was fined S$1 million (RM3 million) and UBS S$1.3 million for breaches in Singapore’s law on prevention of money laundering.

DBS and UBS said in separate statements they would take action against staff responsible for the lapses in their money-laundering controls.

The MAS said it is also finalizing its assessment of the Singapore branch of Standard Chartered Bank and would make an announcement in due course. Standard Chartered had no immediate comment.

Six countries probing 1MDB

The MAS action against Falcon followed a similar move against Swiss-based BSI Bank’s Singapore branch in May, also for failing to control money-laundering activities connected with 1MDB. That was the first time in 32 years Singapore had shut down a bank.

Singapore has so far charged three former BSI bankers and others for their roles in 1MDB-related transactions.

Malaysia’s 1MDB, once a pet project of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak who chaired its advisory board, is the subject of money-laundering investigations in at least six countries, including Switzerland, Singapore and the United States.

The US Department of Justice filed lawsuits on July 20th seeking to seize dozens of properties ties to 1MDB, saying that over US$3.5 billion was misappropriated from the fund.

The lawsuits do not name Najib but say around US$700 million of misappropriated funds flowed into the accounts of “Malaysian Official 1”, who US and Malaysian officials have identified as Najib.

The Wall Street Journal reported last year that investigators had traced nearly US$700 million from an account at Falcon in Singapore to accounts in Malaysia they believed belonged to Malaysia’s Prime Minister Najib Razak.

Both Najib and 1MDB have denied any wrongdoing.

In January, Malaysia’s Attorney General Mohamed Apandi Ali said that Saudi Arabia’s royal family gave Najib a US$681 million gift, of which Apandi said about US$600 million was later returned.

Global financial centres

Singapore and Zurich are two of the world’s leading wealth management centres.

Finma said its review of Falcon had identified around US$3.8 billion associated with the 1MDB Group that was transferred to accounts at Falcon between 2012 and mid-2015 and mostly moved on quickly.

“The business relationships and transactions booked in Switzerland and at Falcon’s Singapore and Hong Kong branches were unusual and involved a high level of risk for the bank both through their nature and the amounts transacted,” it said.

It said Falcon had a number of business relationships with 1MDB group companies and executed transactions amounting to around US$2.5 billion via accounts of two offshore companies.

Falcon also had a client relationship with a young Malaysian businessman with links to individuals in Malaysian government circles, it said without naming him.

“The bank did not verify how this individual had been able to acquire assets of US$135 million in an extremely short period of time or why a total of US$1.2 billion was transferred to his accounts at a later date — a transaction which was clearly at variance with the information he had provided when opening the account,” it said.

Internal warnings from bank staff were ignored, it found.

FINMA banned Falcon from entering new business relationships with foreign politically exposed persons for three years and said Falcon would lose its licence if there is any repetition of the offence.

Berchtold, the Falcon CEO, said the bank had US$900 million in assets in Singapore. The 1MDB case has not prevented the bank from attracting news assets, he added.

‘Clean and trusted’

The regulatory crackdown in Singapore comes at a time when rich Indonesians have begun to move billions of dollars from Singapore-based banks back home to take advantage of a tax amnesty.

Ravi Menon, managing director of Singapore’s central bank said in the MAS statement the board and senior management of financial institutions play a pivotal role in keeping Singapore a clean and trusted financial centre.

“They must put in place robust mechanisms to detect suspicious activities, promote strong risk awareness among their staff, and empower their compliance and risk management people,” said Menon. “Most of all, they must set the tone from the top — that profits do not come before right conduct.” — Reuters
