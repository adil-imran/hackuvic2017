AN Adamawa State High Court yesterday admitted to bail former Governor James Bala Ngilari, who is on trial for alleged award of N167 million contract without due process.

The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) charged Ngilari for alleged violation of procurement laws in the award of contract of N167 million to El-Yadi Motors Limited, for the supply of 25 vehicles.

The ex-governor is facing trial on a 19-count-charge, with the former Secretary to the State Government, Ibrahim Andrew Welye, and former Commissioner for Finance and Budget Sanda Jonathan Lamurde.

They were accused of conspiracy, among others, in the procurement process.

Although they pleaded not guilty, they were remanded in EFCC’s custody on Wednesday.

But Justice Nathan Musa yesterday admitted the ex-governor to N1 million bail

A statement by EFCC’s Head, Media and Publicity Mr. Wilson Uwujaren said: “A former Governor of Adamawa State, Mr. James Bala Ngilari, was on Thursday granted bail by Justice Nathan Musa of the Adamawa State High Court, Yola, in the sum of N1 million, and a surety with landed property in Yola who must provide a court affidavit of means to that effect.

“Ngilari was remanded in EFCC custody on September 21 following his arraignment on a 19-count charge bordering on alleged rigging of procurement process in the award of contract worth N167 million.

The court adjourned to October 10 for trial.

Ngilari is being tried with his former Secretary to the Government and his Commissioner for Finance and Budget, Messrs Ibrahim Andrew Welye and Sanda Jonathan Lamurde.

EFCC yesterday asked financial institutions, especially banks, to refrain from unethical practices impinging on the image and status of Nigeria and its economy

A statement by the anti-graft commission said the Southeast Zonal Head of EFCC, Mr. Johnson Ayodeji Babalola, made the appeal while addressing senior officials from banks across the Southeast states of Enugu, Anambra, Ebonyi, Abia and Imo at a special stakeholders meeting at the Commission’s Office in Enugu.

He said: “You should be careful that these so-called big men do not use you to effect their selfish agenda and, after everything, they will dump you to face the repercussion .”

Describing the relationship between financial institutions and the commission as that of partners, Babalola asked for the cooperation of the bankers, adding that the EFCC cannot effectively fulfill its mandate without the cooperation of banks.

“Because our investigations often involve information on lodgment and movement of cash, your cooperation is needed to improve on intelligence required for progress in any case.”

Later, some EFCC workers and bankers expressed concerns on issues they felt were militating against the smooth relationship between them, such as Know Your Customer (KYC) regime, quality of reports from banks and document verification, among others.
