Chennai, January 8: Soon after the organisers got an approval for popular yet controversial bull-taming sport, Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu, Twitterati took the social networking sites and thanked the Prime Minister Narendra Modi for preserving the century old tradition, while there some who opposed to the decision. The sport is an integral part of Pongal festivities which was banned by the Supreme Court in 2014.

The bull fight which is similar to San Fermin festival organised in Spain came to a halt after animal right activists protested against the sport. The reasons for banning the bull-fight activists gave was animal cruelty and human deaths caused by it. As the Centre uplifted the ban, Twitterati started reacting, some in favour and some were against the decision. Even Union Minister Pon Radhakrishnan tweeted about the Centre’s decision to allow Jallikattu. (ALSO READ: Centre allows Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu despite massive protests)
