And so Mr. Faber set up shop in a factory in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, where his company pioneered the production of colored pencils. (The company also made rubber erasers in Newark.)

Other items in its repertoire: eyebrow pencils, eyeliners, fountain pens, thumbtacks and pencil cases.

In 1956, as many of Brooklyn’s manufacturing businesses fizzled out in the wake of World War II, the Eberhard company sold its headquarters in Greenpoint to move operations to Pennsylvania.

Nonetheless, it’s worth penciling in some time for a stroll along Greenpoint Avenue and Kent and West streets.

Among the mishmash of laundromats, graffiti-covered walls, boutiques and bodegas, you can still see the factory.

The company’s emblem — a large star inside a diamond — crowns several of the area’s red-brick buildings.

And larger-than-life, perfectly sharpened, golden-yellow pencils decorate the facades.

You can learn more from the Landmarks Preservation Commission, which designated the two-block complex a historic district in 2007.

Write on.

Here’s what else is happening:

Weather

Things are getting chilly.

The last two nights have seen lows of 47 degrees, the coldest temperatures recorded in the city since mid-May.

And more sweater weather is on the way.

Today’s high is near 62.

But say hi to the sun, it will be out all day.

And Finally...

At sundown, many Jews in our city — which has the largest Jewish population outside Israel — will begin observing Yom Kippur.

The holiday, known as the Day of Atonement, is one of the most important dates of the Jewish calendar.

This is the first year that the United Nations has recognized Yom Kippur as an official holiday.

The decision was made in December to add the Jewish High Holy Day to the other major holidays officially recognized, which include Christmas, Good Friday, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha.

For many, the period of repentance that started with Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, which was celebrated last week, culminates in Yom Kippur.

Those observing will typically spend a full day — this evening through nightfall tomorrow — fasting, praying, reflecting on self-improvement and asking God for forgiveness.
