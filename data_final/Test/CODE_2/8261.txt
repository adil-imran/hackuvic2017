Mewat, September 11: Almost two weeks after two women from Mewat, Haryana were gangraped, one of them had come forward and claimed that they were sexually assaulted by the attackers for eating ‘beef’. The statement of one of the victim has been recorded in front of Human Rights Activist Shabnam Hashmi in Delhi where the victim said, “They asked if we eat beef. We said we don’t, but they said that was why (we were being punished)”.

Since last two weeks the police, have maintained silence and had reportedly said that neither the women nor their families had mentioned these allegations earlier. A senior police officer had reportedly said that “so far, no link of cow vigilante groups have emerged”. On August 24, a 20-year-old woman and her 14-year-old cousin were sexually assaulted by several men in their home in Mewat. During the incident, their uncle and aunt were tied up and were beaten to death. (Also Read: Mewat murder and rape case: Four youths arrested)

In last 15-days Haryana police officials had arrested 4 accused in their 30s from the village and they were booked on charges of rape and trespassing. After locals living in Mewat protested, murder charges were added in the FIR. In past few months, there have been incidents across India where cow vigilante groups are accused of attacking suspected cattle smugglers. Last month a transporter in Haryana was beaten up for allegedly carrying out beef. The locals living in Mewat have also complained against the biryani shops functioning on the highway, where raids have been carried out by the police.

Victims cousin (name withheld) reportedly said that the four arrested men are habitual criminals and are known as troublemakers in the village. He said, “the main motive seems to have been rape”. After this incident, tensions are running high in Mewat, which is Haryana’s Muslim-dominated region ahead of Bakra Eid on Tuesday after a state university laboratory confirmed that 7 biryani samples collected by the forensic department did contain beef. For last several years, cow slaughter is illegal in Haryana along with sale and storage of beef. Anyone caught breaking the law is punishable by a 10-year jail term or fine of Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh can be imposed on the accused.
