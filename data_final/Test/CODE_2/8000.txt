The Kaduna State Government has issued an order declaring the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, (IMN), an unlawful society. The Declaration Order takes effect from yesterday. The action, according to Governor Nasir El-Rufa’i, was taken to preserve peace and security in the state, as well as to ensure that all persons and organisations are guided by lawful conduct and with due allegiance to the Nigerian state and its Constitution.

Although, when contacted, President of the Media Forum of the IMN, Ibrahim Musa said: “We are studying the content of the press statement and in due course, we will respond appropriately. We are really surprised by the measures taken by the state government which clearly indicates that they are not out to see that justice is done on the massacre committed in Zaria by the Nigerian Army.”

A statement issued and signed by El-Rufai’s Special Assistant, media and publicity, Samuel Aruwan said that Kaduna State Executive Council approved the making of the Order following deliberations at its meeting of Thursday, October 6, 2016.The Declaration Order noted that since the regrettable events in Zaria which resulted in the loss of 347 lives, the IMN “has overtly continued with unlawful processions, obstruction of public highways, unauthorized occupation of public facilities including schools without regard to the rights of other citizens and the public peace and order of the State.”The Order also noted that the acts, if allowed to go unchecked will constitute danger to the peace, tranquility, harmonious co-existence and good governance of Kaduna State.It stated that: “The Order, signed by the Governor, draws on powers vested by the Constitution and the laws of Kaduna State. Section 45 (1) of the Constitution categorically vests in the Governor, the powers to take such measures and actions as are necessary for the promotion and protection of: public safety, public order, public morality or public health; or the rights and freedom of all persons in Kaduna State.”
