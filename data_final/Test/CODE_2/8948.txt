WASHINGTON ― As Hillary Clinton’s election victory appears increasingly likely, liberal groups already have their sights on the next battle: defeating the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.

President Barack Obama issued an official notification last Friday that he plans to submit the Trans-Pacific Partnership for a vote in Congress.

While congressional Republican leaders must still green-light the votes, the move has confirmed for many progressive activists that the White House plans to go all-in for the accord during the lame-duck session of Congress after the November election.

If brought for a vote right now, the prospects of the TPP passing the House would still be bleak. The law allowing the agreement to get a so-called fast-track vote ― no amendments, filibusters or other procedural hurdles ― relied heavily on Republican votes, and enough Republicans have now signaled their opposition to the TPP to ensure its defeat.

But relying on the whims of Republicans during a lame-duck session of Congress is not something the labor unions and progressive netroots organizations want to bank on. Instead, they are preparing to devote resources to the TPP’s downfall in the coming months.

Even before Obama’s action on Friday, many progressives decided to seek Hillary Clinton’s help driving nails into the TPP’s coffin.

Two online progressive activism outfits, Democracy for America and CREDO, along with economist Robert Reich, are collecting signatures for a petition asking Clinton to publicly condemn a vote on TPP in the lame-duck session of Congress after the general election.

CREDO has funded a digital video ad calling on Clinton to do the same.

“Despite the fact that DFA is strongly supporting Sec. Clinton against the billionaire bigot she is running against, we are urging her strongly to stick with her agenda and go even further,” said Neil Sroka, communications director of Democracy for America.

“There is this tendency in politics to treat this as a team sport where my side is always right and the other side is always wrong,” Sroka added. “Working hard and holding leaders accountable means being able to walk and chew gum at the same time ― pushing hard for our nominee and holding candidates accountable on issues that matter to us.”

Asked for comment, the Clinton campaign did not explicitly respond to the idea of publicly opposing a vote on the trade deal. Instead, a spokesman directed HuffPost to Clinton’s remarks during an economic speech last week, in which she expressed her opposition to TPP in the strongest terms to date.

“I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership,” Clinton said while speaking at an advanced manufacturing facility in a suburb of Detroit, Michigan. “I oppose it now. I’ll oppose it after the election. And I’ll oppose it as president.”
