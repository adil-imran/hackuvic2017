Kerala police had identified at least 21 people who had gone missing. Among them, 17 were from Kasargod and four from Palakkad

A mobile phone and a memory card, recovered by National Investigation Agency (NIA) officials from Yasmin Ahmed, the alleged female recruiter of Islamic State (IS), have apparently revealed the blueprint of the plans that the dreaded terror outfit had in store for Kerala.

According to NIA sources, several conversations between Yasmin and an Afghanistan-based IS recruiter Abdul Rahid have been sent to the forensic science laboratory in Thiruvananthapuram, along with the data and content on her mobile phone. Officials on Friday told dna that since there is a lot of material, they are not seeking further police custody of Yasmin. For now, the 28-year-old school teacher from Kerala has been sent to judicial custody.

"From the conversations, it appear that the Afghanistan-based recruiter had convinced Yasmin that the other missing persons from Kerala had safely reached Afghanistan through Iran. Yasmin herself was supposed to take a direct flight from Delhi to Kabul," the official added.

Yasmin was arrested at the New Delhi airport when she was allegedly trying to escape to Kabul to join Abdul Rashid, a native of Kasargod in Kerala. According to sources, Yasmin allegedly told her interrogators that Rashid, before escaping to Afghanistan, had been holding recruitment classes for the IS module in Kerala, and close to 40 youth might have attended some of these classes.

"We have recovered two SIM cards and a memory card from the accused and their contents are being analysed," the official added. The NIA had taken over the case after the Union government issued a directive last month, facilitating the agency to take over the probe from the state police.

The Kerala police had identified at least 21 people who had gone missing. Among them, 17 were from Kasargod and four from Palakkad. They include four women and three children.

Among the youth who left their home state to allegedly join the IS are Bexin Vincent and his wife, who are currently in the Nangarhar province of Afghanistan. Agency sources confirmed that the couple recently had a baby and the news was delivered by Vincent himself to his relatives in Palakkad.

Counter-messaging one way out

Sources said on Friday that the recently concluded conference on Use of Internet in Terror, attended by intelligence officials from the US, Germany, France, the UK, Malaysia and Bangladesh, could lead to a number of innovations being undertaken by anti-terrorism squads in India. A senior government official said that during interactions with intelligence officials from the UK, Indian police officers were impressed by one particular mechanism adopted to counter online radicalism. "UK officials term it as 'counter messaging'. The mechanism is simple. UK officials discussed how their officers spend hours on social media to not only keep a check on discussions but commenting and discussing themselves. UK officers also shared videos or speeches of Islamic preachers who counter the propaganda of IS, which wrongly interpret the Quran to recruit cadres.
