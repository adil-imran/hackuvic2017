Workers engaged in dismantling say clearing the ground within NGT’s timeframe is not possible

When the National Green Tribunal (NGT) allowed the Art Of Living foundation to hold its three-day (March 11-13) World Culture Festival-2016 extravaganza on the ecologically sensitive Yamuna floodplains, it had directed the group to clean up the area “within a month of the event”.

But a visit to the site revealed that the group may not be able to meet this deadline.

Workers engaged in dismantling the gigantic structures put up for the function said that “clearing the ground was simply not possible in the assigned time frame”.

“The massive stage – sprawled over seven acres covering 3,34,358 square feet, almost 100 feet tall and a width of 1,200 feet – will easily take till the end of April to dismantle and transport out. The target of clearing it out by mid-April doesn’t seem possible,” said a worker in the area.

While the Art Of Living has already removed other temporary constructions which were put-up to accommodate seating arrangements for more than 11 lakh people daily and six towering floodlight masts, they maintained that their “volunteers on the field are working to ensure compliance” with the deadline.

“Most of the cleaning is complete. Only area around the stage is left, which will be done simultaneously as the stage is getting dismantled. The dismantling of the stage will be completed by April 13,” said Gautam Vig, spokesperson of Art Of Living.

Despite massive protests by environmentalists and months of litigation, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar’s Art Of Living was able to secure an NGT nod for the mega event on the promise that minimal damage would be done to the area and that the group would clean up “within a month”.

“We have engaged help for housekeeping and cleaning, garbage collection and garbage removal from the venue, waste management for dustbin dissemination etc. Volunteers from are working on the ground to clean up. The volunteers will also continue participating in the clean-up work in the days to come,” the group said.
