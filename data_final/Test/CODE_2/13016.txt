Serious concerns have been raised about the viability and legality of the EU-Turkey refugee deal just three days before its implementation, after rights campaigners alleged that Ankara had been deporting hundreds of refugees back to Syria on a daily basis in recent weeks, and the Greek asylum service said it needed more staff to make the deal work.

In a double blow to the deal, the most senior Greek asylum official, Maria Stavropoulou, called for a 20-fold increase in personnel – while Amnesty International alleged that unaccompanied children were among scores of Syrians illegally expelled from Turkey since January. Hours later, the UN refugee agency again called for a halt to the deal unless Turkey could guarantee refugees’ basic rights.

The news came as hundreds of people detained on a Greek island fled their camp en masse, and other refugees began to sail from mainland Greece to Italy for the first time since eastern European governments began to block their onward route through the Balkans last month.

Seeking to block off a migration route that brought more than 800,000 refugees to Greece from Turkey last year, European and Turkish leaders are set to implement a deal on Monday that will see almost all asylum seekers deported back to Turkey. The success of the deal rests on both Greece’s ability to process thousands of people in a short space of time, and Turkey’s ability to prove itself a safe country for refugees.

Both factors were called into question on Friday, as the Greek parliament voted to begin deportations on Monday. Stavropoulou said her department did not have enough people to process the claims of the many people who, prior to the deal, would simply have passed through Greece on their way to Germany and other wealthier European countries.

“I’m worried about very many things, but the main worry now is about having the capacity to process all these claims,” she said in an interview with the Guardian.

“We have about 300 staff,” she said. “My estimate is that if we are asked to handle anything like half the flow of last year, then we need to have 20 times more capacity.”

The Greek government has already called for the European countries that have imposed the new deal to send 400 asylum experts to help Greece enact it. Just 30 are due to arrive on Sunday, and Stavropoulou said it would be a struggle to get them into action so quickly.

“The situation is extremely volatile,” she said. “There is an expectation that experts can land in Greece and start working the next day, but to give one example of the kind of practical problem that we are dealing with, there aren’t even enough hotel rooms to fit all the experts.”

To justify the deportation of so many people, the EU has argued that Turkey is a safe country for refugees, a controversial claim that Amnesty International cast into further doubt on Friday. The watchdog released a report alleging that hundreds of Syrians have been forced back to their country in the past few months, undermining their basic right to sanctuary on Turkish soil.

Amnesty researchers in southern Turkey gathered testimonies from Syrians whose relatives have been expelled from the country in contravention of international law, including children without their parents. Commenting on the allegations, John Dalhuisen, Amnesty’s Europe and central Asia director, said: “In their desperation to seal their borders, EU leaders have wilfully ignored the simplest of facts: Turkey is not a safe country for Syrian refugees and is getting less safe by the day.

“Far from pressuring Turkey to improve the protection it offers Syrian refugees, the EU is in fact incentivising the opposite.”

The Turkish interior ministry did not respond to a request for comment, but the country’s embassy in the Netherlands later denied Amnesty’s allegations, stating that “no Syrian was ever forced to return to Syria nor were they ever advised or forced to voluntarily return to Syria”.

Turkish officials have responded to similar allegations in the past by maintaining that Turkey respects international refugee law.

The first 500 people to be returned under the deal are set to be deported next week. “On Monday it will begin,” Nikos Xydakis, Greece’s Europe minister, confirmed by phone from parliament. “Not the whole procedure, but the first step.”

Anyone who has applied for asylum in Greece will not be deported until their claims have been processed in the next two weeks, Xydakis said. Deportations in the immediate future will be limited to those have agreed voluntarily to return to Turkey.

Lawyers working on the ground on the Greek islands said it was unclear, however, whether those due to be deported on Monday truly understood their rights, or if those who wanted to apply for asylum were able to make their intentions clear to the Greek police.

As a result, the under-staffed Greek authorities may not be aware of all those who want to claim asylum in Greece, said Lora Pappa, the president of METAdrasi, a charity that provides refugees with legal and humanitarian assistance.

“We don’t know who will be sent back on Sunday: people who really said they didn’t want to apply for asylum, or people who wanted to apply but couldn’t,” Pappa said.

“It’s very difficult for all people to apply. If 1,000 people want to express their will to apply tomorrow, I don’t know if it’s possible for the authorities to process them.”

Two days ago, a METAdrasi lawyer on the island of Chios found that the authorities’ computing system was out of service for several hours.

Stavropoulou is confident that those seeking asylum will be assessed properly, saying that several safeguards had been built into the legislation the Greek parliament adopted on Friday. “We will make sure that between speed and a fair process, we will go for a fair process,” she said.

This week, however, that goal seemed very remote to many of the asylum seekers detained on the island since the deal was first announced two weeks ago. Some 1,600 migrants are kept in a camp meant for 1,100 people, and tensions there on Thursday led to a spate of fighting between frustrated asylum seekers, with three treated for stab wounds. After tensions died down, around half of the detained marched out of the camp on Friday to reach a nearby village, Greek media reported.

Thousands more are stuck on the Greek mainland, after Macedonia shut its border in mid-March. Those with families have largely stayed put, but some are already trying other means of getting to the rest of Europe. On Friday, the UN refugee agency reported that a boat carrying 21 Syrians, Iraqis and Somalians had reached southern Italy – the first to arrive from Greece since the closure of the Macedonian border.

In Turkey, officials in the port of Dikili were preparing on Friday to receive the first batch of deportees next week, but exact details were shrouded in mystery. “We are struggling to understand it ourselves,” said Pırıl Erçoban, the director of Multeci-Der, an NGO based in the area. “Everything is so vague and unclear.”
