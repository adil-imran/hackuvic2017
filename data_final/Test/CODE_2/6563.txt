Hong Kong got a major boost in its future-oriented scientific research when the world-renowned Karolinska Institutet (KI) of Sweden opened its first medical research hub here on Friday.

Called the Ming Wai Lau Centre for Reparative Medicine, the new research facility will focus on regenerative medicine. This field holds the promise of stimulating the body’s own repair mechanisms to heal earlier irreparable tissues or organs.

Under KI’s leadership, the centre will comprise two parts, one being in Stockholm and the other in the Hong Kong Science Park.

The Stockholm-based KI is one of the world’s largest and most prestigious universities for medicine and pharmacy.

Branching out to Hong Kong, said Karin Dahlman-Wright, KI’s acting vice-chancellor, “is a natural step for KI.”

This is partly because of the special administrative region’s (SAR's) position as a global hub for research, innovation and knowledge exchange, she said.

Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying also spoke at the launch ceremony. He said the establishment of the KI research centre demonstrated how far medical science had progressed in Hong Kong.

It also showed how the SAR could use the “One Country, Two Systems” principle to encourage research collaboration between China and other countries, Leung said.

Ronald Li Tang-wai, chief scientific officer of the KI centre, said the centre's research will include stem cell-based regeneration of the heart, liver and nervous systems, especially in areas of aging-associated diseases.

Other research projects will range from biomedical engineering, gene-editing to RNA technology, Li said.

The centre has currently employed five scientists as the leaders of five research teams and will recruit around 50 researchers in 12 to 18 months in the first phase, he said.

Li will lead a research team at the centre. He said the centre will welcome cross-disciplinary collaborations with all universities in Hong Kong. He also expects to apply the research findings to practical situations in the near future.
