President Duterte vowed he will not “barter” away territory and economic rights ahead of a visit to Beijing, where he hopes to mend ties frayed by a row over the South China Sea.

“I will be very careful not to bargain anything (away) for after all I cannot give what is not mine and which I am not empowered to do by any stretch of imagination,” he said in Davao City.

Duterte is now on a state visit to Brunei and will head to Beijing tomorrow where he will bring along a large business delegation in a bid to secure Chinese investment as relations sour between Manila and its traditional ally the United States.

Duterte Sunday said he would also raise with Chinese President Xi Jinping a ruling by an international tribunal that outlawed Beijing’s claim to most of the South China Sea, including waters close to the Philippine coast.China, which rejected the ruling, claims nearly all of the strategically vital waters and has in recent years built artificial islands in the disputed areas that are capable of hosting military bases.

Duterte had earlier vowed not to “taunt or flaunt” the July ruling as he aims to improve trade and investment ties, which some critics warned could entail surrendering exclusive economic rights to the sea to the powerful neighbor.

“The international tribunal’s decision will be taken up, but there will be no hard impositions. We will talk and we will maybe paraphrase everything in the judgment and set the limits of our territories and (exclusive) economic zones.”

During the election campaign, Duterte said he was willing to “set aside” the sea dispute in return for China building a railway through the impoverished southern Philippine region of Mindanao.

His willingness to launch negotiations with China over the dispute has been welcomed by Beijing.

Duterte yesterday said he agreed with senior Supreme Court justice Antonio Carpio that the president could be impeached and removed from office if he gives away Scarborough Shoal, a fishing ground within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone that China seized in 2012.

“He is correct. I would be impeached. It’s an impeachable offence. I don’t fight with that statement. It’s all correct it’s all legal and so I agree with him,” Duterte said.

“It belongs to the Filipino people. I cannot be the sole authorised agent, for that is not allowed under the constitution,” he added.

Since coming to power in May, Duterte’s push to restore ties with China has been accompanied by fiery rhetoric against the United States.

He scrapped a series of annual war games and joint South China Sea patrols with the US military after President Barack Obama criticised Manila’s brutal war on drug crime which has left more than 3,000 people dead.

“I do not see anything wrong in Justice Carpio’s statement. They were valid. I cannot give it up. Nobody can give it up. Nobody in the constitution allows anybody to give it up. Even the President cannot give it up,” Duterte said.

“We will stick with our claim. We will not bargain anything there. There will be no bargaining of our territories,” he stressed.

Carpio warned Duterte on his apparent attitude with China which accordingly tends towards giving up portions of the South China Sea.

Carpio was among the Philippines’ representatives in the said case filed before the PCA back in 2013.

Furthermore, Duterte said that the main intention of his trip to strengthen the country’s bilateral relations with China which turned cold by Aquino’s pro-American stances.

“This is the first state visit of a Philippine President to Beijing since 2011 and signals a key turning point in both our histories. I will look forward to renewing the ties of friendship between the Philippines and China and to reaffirm the commitment to work closer to achieved shared goals for our countries and peoples,” the Chief Executive said of his 4-day trip to China.

“I look forward to exchanging views with the leaders of China on how we can further improve our bilateral relations. We can identify emerging areas of partnership and various fields of cooperation,” he added.

Earlier, in an interview with Al-Jazeera, President Duterte said that his state visit to China is his response to Beijing’s invitation to straighten kinks related to the maritime debacle.

Duterte said talking with Chinese authorities is the best way to prevent possible skirmishes.

“What do you think will happen to my country if I choose to go to war? Fight along? I would call upon other countries to help me? Who would die for my country except us? So we can only talk. That’s why they invited me for talks, I will go,” Duterte said.

Duterte also clarified that his statement during one of the Presidential debates that he’ll ride a jet ski to Scarborough Shoal and plant a Philippine flag on one of the reclaimed islands in South China Sea is a mere assertion of asserting sovereignty but shouldn’t be expected literally.

“Do you really think I’d go there riding? I don’t even own a jet ski. It was a hyperbole. You can’t expect me to ride. I don’t even know how to swim. If it overturns, you lose a president along the way,” he said.

Meanwhile, a fisherfolk group urges the Chief Executive to prioritize their rights to fish along the radius of the Scarborough shoal.

“President Duterte should not beat around the bush and directly ask China of the important things concerning our sovereign right. It ks the most doable and could be achieved in a shortest term, which is to respect the rights of our Filipino fishermen in Scarborough Shoal,” Pambansang Lakas ng Kilusang Mamamalakaya ng Pilipinas (Pamalakaya) chairperson and former Anakpawis Partylist Rep. Fernando Hicap said.
