Will fin breid, barley-bree an paintit room. Whan MacLean meets wi's friens in Springburn. Aa thae roses an geeans will turn tae blume. An a black laud frae yont Nyanga. Dings the fell gallows o the burghers doun.

Black an white ane-til-ither mairriet. Mak the vile barracks o thair maisters bare. Sae come aa ye at hame wi freedom. Never heed whit the houdies croak for Doom. In yer hous aa the bairns o Aidam.

Tak the road an seek ither loanins. Wi thair ill-ploys tae sport an play. Nae mair will our bonnie callants. Merch tae war whan our braggarts crousely craw. Nor wee weans frae pitheid an clachan. Murn the ships sailin doun the Broomielaw. Broken faimilies in launs we've hairriet. Will curse 'Scotlan the Brave' nae mair, nae mair.

Roch the win i the clear day's dawin. Blaws the clouds heilster-gowdie owre the bay. But thair's mair nor a roch win blawin. Thro the Great Glen o the warl the day. It's a thocht that wad gar our rottans. Aa thae rogues that gang gallus fresh an gay.

ISRAEL has suspended cooperation with Unesco after the United Nations cultural agency adopted a draft resolution that it is claimed denies the historic Jewish connection to holy sites in Jerusalem.

ISRAEL has suspended cooperation with Unesco after the United Nations cultural agency adopted a draft resolution that it is claimed denies the historic Jewish connection to holy sites in Jerusalem.

Unesco’s draft resolution, sponsored by several Arab countries, uses only the Islamic name for a hilltop compound sacred to both Jews and Muslims, which includes the Western Wall, a remnant of the biblical temple and the holiest site where Jews can pray.

The validated resolution is expected early next week, but the wording is unlikely to change.

Israelis and many Jews around the world viewed it as the latest example of an ingrained anti-Israel bias at the United Nations, where Israel and its allies are far outnumbered by Arab countries and their supporters.

Education minister Naftali Bennett yesterday informed Unesco director-general Irina Bokova of Israel’s decision to sever ties with the group over its failure to use the name “Temple Mount”.

Bennett said: “Following the shameful decision by Unesco members to deny history and ignore thousands of years of Jewish ties to Jerusalem and the Temple Mount, I have notified the Israel National Commission for Unesco to suspend all professional activities with the international organisation.”

Israel captured East Jerusalem – with its sites holy to Jews, Christians and Muslims – in the 1967 Middle East war.

Palestinians claim the territory as part of their future state, and its fate is a central dispute in the search for a political settlement in the troubled country.

Jews refer to the hilltop compound in Jerusalem’s Old City as the Temple Mount, site of the two Jewish biblical temples.

Muslims refer to it as the Noble Sanctuary, and it is home to the Al-Aqsa mosque and the golden Dome of the Rock.

It is the holiest site in Judaism and the third holiest in Islam, after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.

“The heritage of Jerusalem is indivisible, and each of its communities has a right to the explicit recognition of their history and relationship with the city,” Bokova said in a statement.

“To deny, conceal or erase any of the Jewish, Christian or Muslim traditions undermines the integrity of the site, and runs counter to the reasons that justified its inscription on the Unesco World Heritage list.”

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’s government in the West Bank welcomed the resolution, as did Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza.

A spokesman for Hamas, which is pledged to Israel’s destruction, called it a “step in the right direction”.

The dispute over Jerusalem’s holiest site ignited a wave of violence this time last year. Since then Palestinian attackers have killed 36 Israelis and two visiting Americans, mainly in stabbings.

In the same period, about 220 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire, most of them identified as attackers by Israel.

The Palestinians and rights groups have accused Israeli forces of using excessive force.

Israel has blamed the violence on incitement by Palestinian political and religious leaders, compounded on social media sites that glorify violence.

The Palestinians say it is rooted in some 50 years of military rule and fading hopes for independence.
