Australian state politician Hong Lim yesterday defended the controversial comments he made in a radio interview on August 4, in which he called the Cambodian government a “beast,” telling a group of Cambodian-Australians that his comments hadn’t been directed at the king, or the nation as a whole.



His comments to Radio Free Asia were condemned by the Senate, National Assembly and government officials and caused a small protest outside the Australian embassy in Phnom Penh, with all demanding Mr. Lim publically apologize for what he said.



“It’s my right to talk. I talked about the issue in my country,” he told the audience in Khmer.



“Chinese and Europeans who come here, they still talk about their old countries. They have the freedom to do so,” he added.

He also stressed that he would one day return to Cambodia, despite a statement from the Foreign Ministry last week saying he was no longer welcome in the country.



Council of Ministers spokesman Phay Siphan, who has been vocal of his opposition to Mr. Lim’s comments, told Khmer Times that Mr. Lim’s comments did not constitute an expression of opinion, but rather an attack against the country.



“Although the culture of Cambodia and Australia is different, the values and the dignity of the two nations are to respect and honor, not insult or look down on the ideals of democracy,” he said.



The Australian embassy was forced to issue a statement on August 10, stating Mr. Lim was not a representative of the government or the embassy, but that Australia had a strong tradition of public expression, calling it an important element of the country’s democratic system.



Independent analyst and social development researcher Meas Ny said Mr. Lim’s criticism of the Cambodian government was a little strong, but also aimed at making the government review what happened in society in the past, especially the murder of independent analyst Kem Ley, which until now has not been solved.



In apparent support of Mr. Lim’s comments, opposition member Prince Sisowath Thomico also called the ruling Cambodian People’s Party a “beast regime” in a post on his Facebook page last week, while independent analyst and social development researcher Mr. Ny told Khmer Times last week that Mr. Lim’s comments, while possibly inflammatory, had served a useful purpose.



“So the words Mr. Hong Lim used were strong, but they also served to awaken spirits and make the Cambodian government review what has happened in the past.”
