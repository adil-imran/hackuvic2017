Businessman, who has been fighting kidney disease for 12 years, has a willing donor and govt permissions, but no medico is ready to conduct the operation.



The still-unfolding kidney racket in Mumbai threatens to disrupt a Rajasthan businessman’s 12-year battle against chronic kidney disease.



After a frantic search for a donor, several hospital trips and a battery of tests, the 52-year-old has finally found a match, but city doctors have refused to conduct the transplant to protest their peers’ arrest in the racket.



The medical fraternity’s stubborn stand — which has also resulted from doctors’ fears that they will be subjected to unnecessary and unfair scrutiny in future — has left hundreds of such patients in a distressing limbo. The Rajasthan man’s case is peculiar because he has a willing and compatible donor, something most patients find after a months-long wait, and permissions for a transplant from two states.



The man requested that he not be identified as he is worried that doctors may not take up his case because of media attention.



The kidney racket came to light on July 14 after authorities stopped an illegal transplant at Powai’s LH Hiranandani Hospital. According to investigators, a poor woman from Gujarat offered her kidney to an ailing man for Rs 2 lakh and agreed to pose as his wife for the operation. The pair submitted bogus documents, which were allegedly accepted without verification. Five doctors, including the hospital’s CEO, have been arrested in the case apart from the fake couple and other suspects.



Last month, urologists and nephrologists in the city stopped carrying out transplants to protest the police action. They said doctors cannot be expected to shift their focus from patients to verification of documents, which is the state’s job. All transplants are approved by government officials.



The Rajasthan businessman has been on dialysis for over a decade. Five months ago, he consulted a doctor at a top Mumbai hospital who told him that he urgently needed a kidney transplant to improve his chances. The assessment triggered a hunt for a donor, multiple visits to government offices that register would-be transplant patients, and pleas for help to family and friends — all of which culminated in a fortunate find. A close relative offered to donate her kidney and medical tests revealed that it was a perfect match.



Maharashtra and Rajasthan government officials gave the go-ahead for the surgery, which was scheduled in August. But the anger in the medical fraternity over the arrests in the kidney racket derailed the plans.



“What is our fault? We ran around for months and completed all the formalities, but the surgery cannot take place right now because doctors are upset over some case,” said the 52-year-old’s brother-in-law, Mukesh. “It’s very distressing. My brother-in-law’s health is worsening by the day and we have no option but to wait.”



Mukesh’s sister-in-law has offered her kidney. “After she agreed, we had to get no-objection certificates from Rajasthan and Maharashtra governments. It took us over two months to complete the formalities,” Mukesh said. “My brother-inlaw’s condition was so bad at the time that he couldn’t eat properly.”



The family now plans to get the transplant done in Ahmedabad, but that would require a fresh round of paperwork.
