ANC WC doing damage control following postponement of manifesto launch

ANC provincial leaders will visit branches over the next weeks to quell the concerns of disgruntled members.

CAPE TOWN - The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape is doing damage control following a last minute postponement of its provincial manifesto launch.

The party was to unveil its campaign for the Local Government Elections this weekend.

Those plans have been put aside due unhappiness among some branches about the ward councillor nomination process.

ANC deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa was to make the keynote address at the Khayelitsha launch tomorrow.

ANC provincial leaders will visit branches over the next two weeks to quell the concerns of disgruntled members.

The party's spokesperson Jabu Mfusi says the manifesto launch will be held after discussions.

"We've not yet set the date. Up until we've met all our structures in the province, we'll engage with them."

Some ANC members from the Gugulethu Ward protested outside the ANC's Cape Town offices yesterday.

"We're going to deploy ward 40 into DA because we're sick and tired of corruption in the ANC."

There have been similar protests in Port Elizabeth, King Williams' Town and Kimberley.

NZIMANDE WARNS OF POWER HUNGRY INDIVIDUALS

Meanwhile, South African Communist Party (SACP) leader Blade Nzimande said the ANC faces a problem where people are buying their way to top leadership positions ahead of the local government elections.

Nzimande was addressing delegates at the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) central committee meeting in Centurion.

He said while the ANC is not the only party facing this problem, workers must do what they can to prevent it from being harmed by factionalism.

The SACP leader has called on workers in the NUM and other organisations to defend the ANC's dignity.

"Our revolutionary organisation... we must defend it from factionalism, we must defend it from this money politics."

He said workers should speak up where they see things going wrong as speaking up doesn't mean they love the ruling party less.

"We are raising problems because we want those problems to be corrected. We're not raising them to entertain the media."

He has encouraged those gathered at the committee meeting to ensure they cast their votes on 3 August.
