A retired Sergeant Major committed suicide yesterday having left behind a letter confessing to the murder of former Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickremetunga.

The Sergeant Major identified as Ilandharige Jayamanne(51), a father of three was found in his home yesterday morning, having hung himself.

Kegalle Police conducting investigations said Jayamanne had left a letter with the confession and asked that his friend in custody for the murder be released. They are to produce the letter as evidence in Court.

Sources said the Police were following procedures similar to a murder investigation with regard to the case, given the sensitive nature of the case.

The postmortem conducted at the Kegalle Teaching hospital yesterday, however had ruled it to be suicide and the cause of death to be strangulation.

Military Spokesperson Brigadier Roshan Seneviratne in the meantime said the deceased had retired from the military in 2007 and that they had no information on him thereafter.

The suicide comes a day after the Mt.Lavinia Chief Magistrate rejected bail for the Army Intelligence Officer suspected to be involved in the murder. He has been remanded until October 27.

On January 8, 2009 Lasantha Wickrematunga was shot dead by a group of unidentified men while on his way to work. The murder has since been embroiled with mystery and has since had 17 Army officers arrested and then released over the course of three years since 2009.

In 2015, investigations in the murder was reopened and in February 2016, the CID released composite sketches of two suspects believed to have committed the murder. By July, the CID arrested an officer of the Directorate of Military Intelligence in connection to the murder and

Wickremetunga’s driver identified the officer as a suspect at an identification parade.

The Mt.Lavinia Magistrate’s Court thereafter granted permission to exhume the remains of the slain journalist for a new autopsy and the body was exhumed in September.
