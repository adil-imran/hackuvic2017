Chennai: A major consignment of cocaine worth 10 crore meant for distribution in cities across the country was seized by the Chennai unit of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) from a hotel in Pallavaram on Friday night.The 3.7kg consignment of 'very pure cocaine', procured from production belts in Rio de Janeiro by Dasilva Jailson - a Brazilian - was concealed between the outer cover of notebooks and in seven children's books, investigators said."Jailson was travelling from Rio to Chennai via Dubai . He had a tourist visa vakud till February 2017 but was planning to leave on September 24 after delivering the contraband," an official from NCB said. The courier, booked under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, has been sent to Puzhal jail.In May 2016, a similar seizure of 2kg cocaine was made from the Hyderabad airport by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI). The courier was carrying the narcotic in between aluminum foils used to cover notebooks.With this seizure, one of the largest in recent times, the NCB claimed that it had dealt a severe blow to the organised cocaine syndicate operating in southern states. Sources said the incident pointed to a trend of growing cocaine use in the party circuits in southern India. "Earlier the drug would be smuggled out to countries like Malaysia and Singapore. But now it is being consumed in India as well. It can be sourced only from South American countries," an NCB official said.The official said another courier, also from Brazil , was arrested before the December floods last year. "That courier had brought one kilogram of cocaine but the modus operandi was different. It was packed inside rubber packets which were swallowed and kept inside the stomach," the official said.With intelligence officials keeping close tabs, smugglers are improvising on methods used to supply narcotics. For instance, powdery drugs like cocaine are being carefully packed inside hair-dye packets to escape attention. In another instance, the sponge in the marker pens was taken out and filled with cocaine."There were 250 marker pens and the total amount of cocaine was around 2.5kg," an NCB official said.In foreign countries, smugglers have been found to pack the drugs in their nappy pads which are worn underneath the pants or stuck to a skullcap like material which is worn under the wig. Sometimes it is also concealed inside prosthetic limbs; however, these methods are yet to be uncovered in southern India, the NCB official said. "Currently, the most popular modus operandi is to hide it inside a special cavity inside suitcases, or hot-packs or footwear," an investigator with the agency said.
