Oil prices pulled back Tuesday after the monthly report from the Paris-based International Energy Agency said global supplies rose in September.

The December contract for global crude benchmark Brent was down 0.9% at $52.68 a barrel while its U.S. counterpart West Texas Intermediate fell 0.8% to $50.95 for November deliveries.

The IEA said global oil supply hit 97.2 million barrels a day in September, up 600,000 barrels a day compared to August, and 200,000 b/d higher year-on-year. The majority of the rise came from Russia which output rose by 400,000 b/d to a post-Soviet high of 11.1 million b/d.

The data came 24 hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin told a conference in Istanbul that his country was prepared to freeze or cut production to help stabilize oil markets. His comments sent Brent to a 2016 high of $53.73 during yesterday's trading.

Bjarne Schieldrop from Sweden's SEB bank said that Russia was not the only major producer that would be ramping up output in the coming weeks. Higher production was to be expected from all of the major producers who have agreed to participate in production cuts including members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.

"All producers will want to increase production by as much as possible to give themselves a higher base for negotiations," the analyst said. "The solution is a double-edged sword in that it will also lead to several bearish elements engulfing the market in the coming weeks. If an agreement is not reached in November, there will surely be a large price correction to follow."

Other bearish factors from the IEA report included growing exports from Libya as well as almost zero oil demand growth in China during the third quarter of 2016.

With prices for Brent and WTI still over $50 a barrel, the pressure is growing on OPEC to deliver on the pledge to cut production.

Germany's Commerzbank said in a note that the expectation of cuts has led to a massive increase in speculative net long positions, a market term for a commodities contract that is betting the price of oil will rise. Speculative net long positions in Brent and WTI have grown by 70,600 and 67,900 contracts respectively since late September. The bank adds that this development will only increase pressure on OPEC to follow up on its words.

The industry body the American Petroleum Institute releases its U.S. crude inventory forecast today, ahead of tomorrow's official data from the Energy Information Administration. No major fall or rise is expected in stocks, but trading activity may heighten around both announcements.

Nymex reformulated gasoline blendstock futures--the benchmark gasoline contract--was down 1.54% at $1.47 a gallon, while diesel futures traded at $1.59, 1.27% lower.

ICE gasoil futures changed hands at $471.75 a metric ton, down 1.41%.
