MANILA, Philippines – Brace for devastation as Typhoon Lawin (international name Haima) is expected to intensify into a super typhoon as strong as Yolanda before hitting Northern Luzon tomorrow morning.

The state weather agency yesterday warned that Lawin would bring destructive winds and storm surges as high as five meters in coastal villages.

The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) also warned that the impending landfall of Lawin in Northern Luzon would likely result in devastation in areas along the projected path of the cyclone.

Tropical cyclone warning signal No. 4 or 5 is expected to be raised over Cagayan, including the Calayan Group of Islands, Apayao, Ilocos Norte and northern Isabela tonight as the typhoon moves closer to Cagayan.

Lawin’s maximum sustained winds could reach 220 kilometers per hour or higher before hitting landmass, according to Esperanza Cayanan, chief of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) weather division.

“As of this time it (Lawin) has maximum sustained winds of 185 kph but it is still over the sea, so we’re not yet discounting the possibility that it could become a super typhoon,” Cayanan told reporters.

She warned Lawin’s strength is comparable to that of Super Typhoon Yolanda, which packed winds of 235 kph and gustiness of up to 285 kph when it hit Eastern Visayas on Nov. 8, 2013.

“We can expect the same damage brought by Yolanda if it reaches 220 kph,” Cayanan warned.

“Residents in disaster-prone areas are alerted against the possibility of landslides and flashfloods. The occurrence of storm surge of up to five meters is likely to happen over the coast of Cagayan, including Calayan Group of Islands and the northern tip of Ilocos Norte,” NDRRMC executive director Ricardo Jalad warned.

“Very strong winds, which may destroy high- to low-risk structures and topple down trees and transmission towers, are expected. Sea travel and other coastal activities are risky over the eastern seaboard of Luzon,” he added.

As of yesterday afternoon, 278 passengers were stranded at Tabaco City port in Albay after the Philippine Coast Guard did not allow a roll-on, roll-off vessel en route to San Andres, Catanduanes to depart due to the arrival of Lawin.

PAGASA deputy administrator Jun Dalida appealed to the people in areas along the path of Lawin to follow the advice of their local officials.

“We still have two days to prepare. We hope for zero casualty, even if we expect this to be a powerful typhoon,” he said.

As of 4 p.m. yesterday, the eye of Lawin was located at 930 km east of Tayabas, Quezon with maximum sustained winds of up to 185 kph near the center and gustiness of up to 230 kph. It is forecast to move west-northwest at 25 kph.

As of 5 p.m. yesterday, signal No. 1 was hoisted over Ilocos Norte, Apayao, Cagayan including the Calayan group of Islands, Batanes group of Islands, Isabela, Kalinga, Abra, Ilocos Sur, Mountain Province, Ifugao, Quirino, Nueva Vizcaya, Benguet, La Union, Aurora, Nueva Ecija, Pangasinan, Catanduanes and Polillo Islands.

These areas can expect intermittent rains and winds of 30 kph to 60 kph within at least 36 hours, PAGASA said.

As a precaution, classes in all public and private pre-schools are automatically suspended in areas under signal No. 1.

Apayao Gov. Elias Bulut Jr. yesterday declared a suspension of classes in the province for four days, from today until Friday.

Lawin is projected to make landfall over Cagayan by early tomorrow morning, then cross Apayao and Ilocos Norte.

PAGASA warned the public against going out to the eastern seaboard of Southern Luzon and the northern and eastern seaboards of Samar.

PAGASA weather forecaster Aldczar Aurelio said moderate to heavy to at times intense rains will affect Northern Luzon, particularly the provinces of Isabela, Ifugao and Mountain Province, tomorrow until Friday.

Metro Manila could also experience light to moderate rains from Lawin.

The typhoon is forecast to exit the Philippine area of responsibility on Friday morning.

Typhoon Karen

Meanwhile, Typhoon Karen exited the country yesterday but left several people dead or missing and damaged millions in crops and infrastructure.

In Bauang town in La Union, Joshua Fernandez, 31, drowned while swimming in the seashore of Barangay Baccuit Sur yesterday, the town police said. Fernandez was from Baguio City.

In Cagayan Valley, four people went missing and are believed to have drowned during the onslaught of Karen. They are Simeon Baccay, 67; Gavino Cuntapay, 43; Nathaniel Lucas, 17; and Jean Carlo Balacanao, 13.

The cost of damage to agriculture in Central Luzon was initially pegged at P2.14 billion.

According to the Regional Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (RDRRMC), agricultural losses were recorded in Aurora, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga and Tarlac.

The palay sector incurred the biggest damage at P2,141,252,435.58. Damage to high-value crops was initially pegged at P149,700.

In Pangasinan, damage to agriculture and infrastructure was initially pegged at P63 million. – With Ric Sapnu, Raymund Catindig, Jun Elias, Eva Visperas, Celso Amo, Artemio Dumalao
