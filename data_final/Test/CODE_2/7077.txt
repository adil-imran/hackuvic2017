SEPANG: A group of eight resear­chers who went on the 2016 Malaysian Scientific Research to Antarctica was able to achieve its target and brought home more than 200 samples.

Science, Technology and Inno­vation De­­puty Minister Datuk Dr Abu Bakar Mohamed Diah said the researchers, who are from six public and private universities, had brought home samples of water, algae, sediment, weed, rocks, marine invertebrates, pollen and soil.

He said the group also recorded the readings of greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the geomagnetic data, during the 22-day scien­tific expedition to the Antarctica, which began on Jan 18.

“The samples and recordings of the greenhouse gas readings are for scientific research related with Antarctica, biodiversity and climate change, with emphasis on greenhouse gas and the ozone layer,” he said after welcoming the researchers at the KL International Airport (KLIA) here yesterday.

The expedition, costing RM450,000, is the first expedition financed by the Sultan Mizan Antarctica Research Foundation, and was carried out with the cooperation of the Science, Technology and Innovation Ministry.

Abu Bakar said the outcome of the research would provide knowledge that could help the people to better understand the phenomenon of climate change.

The findings by the researchers would be tabled at the Science Conference of the Antarctica Research Scientific Committee to be held in August, he added.

Meanwhile, expedition head Dr Mohamad Huzaimy Jusoh, who is a senior lecturer at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Mara, said the expedition was a challenging one as they had to brave huge waves as high as 6m and strong winds of up to 80kph.

While at Antarctica, he said, they stopped at the South Korean-owned King Sejong Research Station in King George Island.

The samples they took during the expedition were taken at Greenwich Island, Decep­tion Island, Darboux Island, Danco Coast, Paradise Bay, Enterprise Island and Trinity Island, he added. — Bernama
