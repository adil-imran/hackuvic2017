KARACHI - Mourning processions of 8th Muharram to pay homage to the martyrs of Karbala concluded peacefully in Karachi on Monday under strict security measures that included ban on pillion ridding as well.



Large number of people, including women and children, participated in the main procession that began from the Shah-i-Khurasan Imambargah near Nishtar Park, and passed through its traditional route.

Majlis-e-Aza was held at the start, and was addressed by Maulana Muhammad Ali Naqvi in which he highlighted the matchless sacrifice of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA).



He said the mission of Imam Hussain (RA) is distinctly unique and revolutionary in nature.



“Imam’s sacrifices to save Islam are still remembered across the Muslim world.

Each of us should act as Imam Hussain (RA) because by following Hussain in his footsteps, we can revive the spirit of Karbala,” he added.



After passing through Mehfil-e-Shah Khurasaan, Saddar, Preedy Street, Baba-e-Urdu Road and MA Jinnah Road, the procession culminated at Hussainian Iranian Imambargah in Kharadar peacefully.

The law-enforcement agencies (LEAs) personnel were deployed to protect the main procession and Majalis venue while surveillance was also conducted through closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras.

All the shops in Saddar and along the procession routes were closed by placing containers.



Furthermore the roads linking procession routes and Majalis venue were also closed.

Security personnel were also deployed at buildings’ rooftops to monitor proceedings of the procession.



Scouts organisations, rescue services and city administration had also made necessary arrangements to facilitate participants of the procession.



The Sindh Home Department had under Section 144 imposed complete ban on pillion riding in the city.



Moreover, the Health Department Sindh and Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) had declared emergency in all public sector hospitals of Karachi and other parts of province and ordered availability of doctors, paramedics and medicines.
