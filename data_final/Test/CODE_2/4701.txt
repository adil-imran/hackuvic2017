Illegal Alien Kidnaps and Rapes Six-Year-Old Girl in Texas

Conservative Treehouse ^ | October 10, 2016 | Sundance

Posted on by detective

Fort Worth police say a man accused of kidnapping a six-year-old girl from her home also raped her before she was found.

Police say Edis Moya Alas kidnapped the girl Saturday from her home in southeast Fort Worth. The girls father said he noticed the front door was open and the girl was gone about 5 a.m.

Officers say Moyas relationship to the girl is still unclear and he is not cooperating with the investigation.

How long are people going to just sit by and allow our children to be raped? Trump is the only one talking about doing something about this problem. And he is continually attacked for it.

Hillary Clinton is on the record stating that she wants open borders.

To: detective

This would be a good example to bring up at the final debate. Illary wants the borders open so this can keep happening. Trump wants the borders secured so our children are less likely to be vicitimized by illegal invaders. America, you have a choice to make.

Yeah, but did he use bad words. That’s what really matters. (Sarcasm)



To: soycd

In other words, we dont really know WTF happened. What do you mean? What relationship could a grown-ass man have with a six-year old girl if he's not the Father or an immediate relative? What, he got pissed over a game of dress-up or something?



To: detective

If that animal had done that to one of my daughters, I will guarantee that he would never be able to use his pecker again. Tak that how ever you want. And if that would mean time in jail for me, so be it. I have had it with these scum. Thank you Obama, you sorry excuse for a human.

To: detective

Anybody who supports open borders is okay with these pedophiles. In addition, Hillary wants to take our guns, thus making us even more helpless.



To: BenLurkin

Glenn beck is all in on child rape as a good thing.....He has officially come out and stated voting for Hillary is the moral thing to do..Millions more across the border will only help children learn about sex first hand..Glenn is all for it....



To: detective

[ How long are people going to just sit by and allow our children to be raped? ] Obviously the only solutions to this are more mass illegal border-jumping, importing Middle Eastern muslims, and less jobs for people born in America. Oh, and no 2nd Amendment lest Americans be able to defend themselves against criminals.

If hillary is elected president she will own every fellon committed by illegals and every act of terrorism committed by muslims.

Of course she won’t care because ..she doesn’t have any true empathy for anyone.

Your comment might have some merit if she was sixteen. But six year old girls do not have “relationships” with unrelated adult males.

Justice will get served if they take an animal like this and hold him for a few hours, let him get his lawyer and release him (after informing the community). Courts do nothing, he will plead it to a misdemeanor and do a few months in lockup and the FED GOVT will either not deport them or do anything to deter them from returning. Need to either wall or heavily secure border (Europe doesn’t ‘like’ us again) bring the NATO troops back and put them on the border... Give UN the boot also. Get those problems ‘solved’ and then we can go to work on straightening out the Government. Of course Pres Trump will be able to live in HIS hotel while they are fumigating the White Hut....

We the citizens of the great Republic of Texas have been dealing with illegal immigration for decades. Illegal aliens cause higher homeowners/auto insurance rates, higher property taxes to support indigent medical care, incarceration, education, law enforcement, social programs. Very few political leaders on a municipal, state, county level will even admit this. We are all PAYING out the nose because of illegal immigration. Illegals show up in our emergency rooms, receive treatment, pay a portion of the bill, then skip out. Giving false contact info, leaving the hospitals to write off the loss...which then translates into higher property taxes to cover the shortfall of the hospital districts. Illegal immigration is NOT a victimless crime. Illegals cross our federal boundaries, it is a misdemeanor. It is what they must do to remain in our country that is amounts to multiple felonies. Perjury on state, local government documents to obtain assistance from food stamps to housing to education assistance. Fraudulent documents, forgery, mail/wire fraud. YOU...American citizen, lie on a document and see what happens. How bout tax evasion? Illegal aliens work here...what about filing tax returns? I saw an advertisement for a housing development some years back....no documentas/no problemos. So, no documents, no problem? How do they obtain loans for a home? U.S. citizens are getting the big shaft. We have to take a bite out of the $4!t sandwich and shut up and accept it. How bout sanctuary cities? City governments forbid local law enforcement from even asking citizenship status. They get a traffic citation....and skip out. Illegals get into an accident here in Texas and often times they get out of the vehile and run away. If they do not have time to run, they hop in the back seat and claim the driver ran...again, falsifying a government document (accident report). No insurance, the other driver's coverage pays the tab. Illegal immigration hurts the hell out of every working citizen. Just think about how less expensive the cost of living would be if we were not dealing with illegal immigration. All these taxing entities just bury the cost to citizens. This is not even touching the cost of crime caused to our citizens. Enough already.

Sorry for the rant, but this is the true cost of illegal immigration.

Yes, they do know what happened, that’s why he’s been charged with kidnap and rape. What they are unclear on is how he came into contact with and targeted this particular child.

Our “leaders” think they are completely safe. Behind their

This comes on the heels of Dallas' version of Kate Steinle x2. A Mexican illegal scumbag alien that had been deported three times since 1996 killed two people at a gas station in Cedar Hill on 25Sep16. Silvestre Luviano is one of the 8 aliases/stolen identities he was using. First media reports tried to say his name was Silvester Luciano, which sounds a helluva lot more Italian than Mexican. Disgusting... Scouts Out! Cavalry Ho! God Bless Texas!
