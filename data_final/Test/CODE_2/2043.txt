I’m firmly convinced that we have had enough at the hands of Pak. - GD Bakshi

Abhinav Surya, an IITian wrote a letter to his institute director in which he said: “I am still not able to digest the fact the institute has given platform to such a speech filled with hatred, instigating violence among the students. A lecture that was heavily loaded with brewing enmity, inhumanity and glorification of brutality.”

GD Bakshi is reportedly heard saying: “In our generation, we split Pakistan into two. Your generation should split it into four. Only then we can live in peace!”

In the letter he claimed that GD Bakshi also glorified nuclear weaponry and its usage. Surya further wrote: “The underlying implication behind his constant call to “give tit-for-tat” was for calling out students to take up violent aggressiveness as their strategy (This might even be the reason for the violent behaviour of few students in the hall who were intimidating the students who were trying to question the speaker).”

Surya further wrote: “As much as I want freedom of expression to be upheld, I am seriously concerned, as a student of IIT Madras about the sustenance of peace and harmony among various students of IIT Madras. I hope necessary actions will be taken.”

Reacting to the outrage over his speech at IIT Madras which one student deemed to be hate-mongering retired general GD Bakshi took to Facebook to write a message to Abhinav Surya and others.

He wrote on Facebook:

I had gone to IIT Chennai yesterday to give a talk on Indian army and our National Security. When I began to address the subject of J&K a handful of Kashmiri students tried to shout me down and disrupt the lecture.

One Master Abhinav a member of the Ambedkar - Periyar Sangarsh Samiti joined them. To my very pleasant surprise they were jeered and booed down by the majority of the IIT boys and Girls there in a stirring display of patriotic fervour.

They were restrained from disrupting the proceedings and forced to pipe down and let the lecture continue. Stung Abhinav fired off a rather confused and rambling letter to the Director among other things accusing me of hate speech (against Pakistan if you please) and the usual gamut of HR violations the Leftist liberals use to demonise the Army and lower its prestige and morale.

Yes, Abhinav as a soldier I detest Pak and the role it is playing in J&K. I was rather amused to see the leftist media sense the scalp of Gen Bakshi and transform young Abhinav into another media icon (like Comrade Kanhaiya) of separatism. He tried to make his rambling letter viral and I’m grateful to Abhinav and our leftist liberal media for taking up the basket of issues I had raised.

I’m firmly convinced that we have had enough at the hands of Pak. Their latest revocations on J&K are DANGEROUS and India needs to hit back. Yes, India needs to adopt a tit for tat approach to China which has armed Pak to the teeth. We need to arm Vietnam, Philippines, Indonesia, etc.

I also highlighted the role played by Indian armed forces and INA in India getting freedom. We have been crying for the need to revise Indian history. I’m glad sections of the media want to raise these issues at the time of our independence. Let us please join the debate. Thank you Master Abhinav for getting the Leftist liberal media to cover what I said. Some of them have been trying hard to bury these issues.
