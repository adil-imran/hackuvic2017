NEW DELHI: Austrian crystal maker Swarovski is collaborating with 11Indian designers, including Rohit Bal JJ Valaya and Suneet Verma , to launch a new India-inspired fashion jewellery range called Confluence which will be launched in multi-brand designer stores by next month."Our jewellery is more avant-garde and progressive in its design language as it is essentially built for markets like the US and Europe. In India, our transaction data reveals that our products are mostly used for gifting," said Vivek Ramabhadran, managing director, Swarovski Professional India.There is a huge acceptance for Indian designer luxury brands, but their business is not operating at a scale that the industry needs, Ramabhadran said."The answer for scaling up is in accessories. From the components side we understand design collaborations and we can bridge the gap," he said. By the middle of October, Confluence will also be available on an online platform. The collection, to be priced between Rs 4,000-15,000, will have about 80 designs to begin with and another 80 will be added in the next two months."In early January or February (2017), we will take it one step further and do partnerships with one-two large format department chains. Right from manufacturing to fitting to cost, to prototype finishing and packaging to taking it to the stores. The entire value chain will be operated by us," Ramabhadran said. Bridal garments constitute 35 per cent of Swarovski's business in India and corporate gifting is the fastest growing segment for the brand which is also considering selling products through its own website.A significant volume of business is also generated through its wholesale trade in India.Ramabhadran said the company is also in talks with senior officials at online portals to deal with counterfeit products that are turning out to be a "nuisance". "Millions of suppliers from China are listing their products on platforms like Amazon or Flipkart stating they use our crystals," he said.
