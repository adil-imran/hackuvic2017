Wearing pink for king

Many people yesterday wore pink for 88-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej, a color they believe will help improve the monarch’s health, two days after the palace said he was in an unstable condition. The palace said on Sunday that the king’s health was “not stable,” in a rare public comment on the monarch’s health. Messages shared on social media since the palace statement have urged the public to wear pink, a color which first became important a few years ago when royal astrologers said it was good for the king and would promote well-being.

Journalist cannot leave

The government has imposed a travel ban on a leading journalist after he sparked an uproar by reporting that civilian officials had clashed with the military over its covert support for militants. Cyril Almeida, an assistant editor at Dawn, the nation’s oldest and most prestigious English daily, said early yesterday that he had been placed on the “exit control list.” “I am told and have been informed and have been shown evidence that I am on the exit control list,” he tweeted, followed a short time later by “I feel sad tonight. This is my life, my country. What went wrong.” In his report on Friday last week, Almeida said leading civilian officials had warned the powerful army to renounce covert support for proxy fighters or face isolation.

Women happier today: poll

Women today are much happier with being female compared with 70 years ago, according to a BBC poll published on Monday, which also showed they are more positive about marriage and happier with their choice of husband. Nearly nine in 10 women surveyed said they would rather be a woman than a man, compared with just over half in 1947. The poll of 1,004 women also showed that 42 percent thought men and women gave up equal amounts of freedom in marriage. Only a quarter of men and women who took part in a survey in 1951 thought the same. Eighty-seven percent of respondents said they would marry the same partner if they had their time again, compared with 77 percent of women and men asked the same question in a Gallup poll of both sexes in 1949. The biggest worriers were women aged 25 to 34, with top concerns including their health and the health of their families, not having enough money in old age and making ends meet.
