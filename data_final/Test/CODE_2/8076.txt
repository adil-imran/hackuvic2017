Will fin breid, barley-bree an paintit room. Whan MacLean meets wi's friens in Springburn. Aa thae roses an geeans will turn tae blume. An a black laud frae yont Nyanga. Dings the fell gallows o the burghers doun.

Black an white ane-til-ither mairriet. Mak the vile barracks o thair maisters bare. Sae come aa ye at hame wi freedom. Never heed whit the houdies croak for Doom. In yer hous aa the bairns o Aidam.

Tak the road an seek ither loanins. Wi thair ill-ploys tae sport an play. Nae mair will our bonnie callants. Merch tae war whan our braggarts crousely craw. Nor wee weans frae pitheid an clachan. Murn the ships sailin doun the Broomielaw. Broken faimilies in launs we've hairriet. Will curse 'Scotlan the Brave' nae mair, nae mair.

Roch the win i the clear day's dawin. Blaws the clouds heilster-gowdie owre the bay. But thair's mair nor a roch win blawin. Thro the Great Glen o the warl the day. It's a thocht that wad gar our rottans. Aa thae rogues that gang gallus fresh an gay.

BREXIT poses “daunting challenges” to the economy of Scotland’s biggest city, its leader claims in a new report.

BREXIT poses “daunting challenges” to the economy of Scotland’s biggest city, its leader claims in a new report.

Frank McAveety, leader of Glasgow City Council, said he is “dismayed” by the referendum result in a new paper detailing potential threats to the city’s fortunes.

It calls upon the Scottish and UK governments to match the £780 million of EU structural and investment funds pledged to the business hub between 2014 and 2020.

It also calls on both administrations to transfer surplus land holdings in the city to the local authority to allow the “acceleration of major housing building programmes” to boost jobs and meet accommodation needs, and to give guarantees about the immigration status of EU students for the next academic year.

Around 6,400 EU students are currently placed in the city’s higher and further education sector, with another 1,230 staff in this category.

EU research money is also worth £25 million to Glasgow’s institutions every year.

In the report, released yesterday by the Glasgow City Council, the Glasgow Economic Leadership (GEL) board and Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, McAveety said: “Clearly there is a defined body of opinion that believes that Brexit is not a threat but rather offers an opportunity and that Scottish business, in particular, will rise to the occasion as Brexit proceeds.

“Central to that is the idea that the EU restricts the UK’s ability to trade with the rest of the world and the new circumstances of free trade post Brexit will see a huge development of the Scottish and UK economies when the chains of EU regulations are broken.

“The preponderant view of the economic research institutes here in Scotland and across the UK, private business, and official forecasts is that the likely short-term to medium consequences of Brexit, based on the uncertainties it has created, are likely to be negative.

“The findings of this report suggest that every element of the GEL economic workstream faces what can only be described as daunting challenges.”

The report reveals how employment levels in 2014 remained 30,000 below pre-recession levels, with long-term joblessness at 30 per cent that year, compared to 13 per cent in 2009.

Meanwhile, population growth is slower than in most UK comparator core cities and the 23,000 additional jobs forecast by 2023 will still keep the total under the pre-crash high.

More than 100 senior business, local government and academic leaders contributed to the report, including Strathclyde University principal Professor Sir Jim McDonald – chair of the GEL – and Professor Julie Brittenden of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.

It will now be submitted to the First Minister’s Standing Committee on Europe.

McDonald said: “There is no doubt that Brexit is a fundamental system shock and one that poses challenges to us all. However, Glasgow is well used to challenge, indeed, agility and proactivity are woven into the city’s history.”

Stuart Patrick, chief executive of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, said: “In order to take advantage of the new world as it exists in the aftermath of the Brexit vote and to seize opportunities, a clear, collective, coherent and forward-looking approach from the City of Glasgow and from the Scottish and UK governments is required.

“We cannot do this alone and whilst uncertainly continues around our future trading relationship with the EU we must combine all our efforts now to secure investment and jobs and to boost trade. The Glasgow economy is robust, dynamic and multi-faceted and well placed to take advantage of what is soon to come.”
